Not unlike the larger regions of which it is part, the Valley's cultural landscapes have long been constructed as sites of wealth, fertile ground, and opportunity. Drawn to the region's myriad promises and possibilities, populations moving into and within the region often search for their part in a frequently elusive California Dream. Yet as with any place, the lived experience of the Valley's residents is often far removed from the construction of the region as a land of prosperity and mobility. Tracing the various constructions of region in the Great Central Valley requires an understanding of cultural and regional identity as complex and multifaceted. No two individuals experience the landscapes they inhabit in the same way; as a result, any attempt to define a unitary regional identity in the Valley is ultimately problematic. Despite the diverse experiences and interpretations of the Valley and its inhabitants, many overlapping themes emerge, resulting in what I call a ""regional imaginary'-a set of meanings assigned to a region by its residents. Although many methods exist by which to explore and tentatively define the idea of a regional imaginary in the Central Valley, one of the most productive involves utilizing critical regional approaches to literature and other narrative works. By examining the many novels, poems, and other narratives written about the Valley, the various cultural, historical, and natural forces that converge and conflict in the Valley's landscapes may begin to come into focus."

Of particular interest were the effects of cooperative learning structures on student engagement, attitudes towards Science 8 class, and understanding of middle school earth science concepts. In addition, teacher pedagogy and attitude towards teaching middle school earth science were monitored. Two non-treatment units utilizing traditional 'lecture-lab' teacher-centered instruction were compared to two treatment units which incorporated three cooperative learning structures: Think-Pair-Share, Gallery Walk, and Jigsaw. Results indicated a slight improvement in student engagement, though a more dramatic increase in peer interactions. In addition, student's and teacher's attitude toward Science 8 increased. Results did not indicate improvement in students understanding of middle school earth science concepts. However, cooperative learning structures were found to be an effective and meaningful way to provide opportunities for students to develop positive peer relationships. These relationships ultimately led to a student-centered classroom.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

CBM water is often high in sodium, which may separate soil clay particles, particularly after soil exposure to low-salinity rainfall or snowmelt, and when soils contain expansible smectite clay minerals. Aggregates in soils exposed to sodic water may swell and slake, and clays and other fine particles may disperse, clogging soil pores and slowing or preventing soil water flow. In the soil columns experiment, A and B horizon materials from sandy loam, silt loam, and clay loam soils were pre-treated with water having salinity and sodicity typical of PRB CBM water or of Powder River (PR) water currently used for irrigation in the basin. Tension infiltrometer measurements were used to determine infiltration flux, first using pre-treatment water, and subsequently deionized (DI) water, simulating rainwater. Measurements were compared by pre-treatment water, horizon, and soil type. Under pre-treatment water testing, the sandy loam and clay loam soils pre-treated with CBM water exhibited smaller infiltration flux values than when pre-treated with PR water. Only the sandy loam soil showed a greater decrease in infiltration flux with DI water on soils pre-treated with CBM relative to PR water pre-treated soils. There was no difference in infiltration flux decrease with DI water between A and B horizon soils, or between smectite and non-smectite soils. The soil water balance numerical simulations modeled potential effects of sodic irrigation waters on sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and silty clay PRB soils under sprinkler or flood irrigation, during one growing season. Baseline soil water retention functions were constructed for the five soils, and adjusted via trends identified in the literature to create five additional functions for each soil, simulating exposure to five increasingly sodic irrigation waters. Simulation results showed greater impact of sodic irrigation under flood than sprinkler irrigation. The fine sandy loam and silty clay loam soils exhibited the fewest changes in water balance partitioning, while the silt loam and silty clay soils showed the greatest changes, especially in increased runoff and reduced transpiration.

This assessment explores how a new training module for teaching urban youth groups and underserved youth groups could create more effective instructors. In order to identify best practices for teaching to this demographic, five instruments were employed to survey and interview administrators, instructor staff and leading experts in this field. The literature review revealed that students achieve more when provided with a safe learning environment where they are valued as individuals, and where the teaching methods employed are student centered. The literature supports that students often become more confident, respectful and excited about science when allowed to learn and explore in an outdoor setting. The literature suggests that students will build a strong connection to nature only if they are provided with opportunities to develop their own sense of place within that new environment. The research gathered in this needs assessment suggests that a successful training module is one which promotes a culture of caring and respect, teaches instructors cultural awareness and develops their cultural competence. It should encourage effective communication and provide practical advice for successfully identifying and meeting the educational needs of urban youth and underserved youth, learning in an outdoor setting.

Yet it is national science standard, a foundation in the field of biology, and a key to science literacy. A constructivist mini-unit incorporating simulation-based games involving a population of imaginary creatures called Chukwins was created to maximize student learning and minimize tension. It was tested in an elementary, junior high, and high school classrooms in three different locations. Changes in understanding were assessed with pretest/posttest data. Surveys and interviews provided additional evidence on students' attitudes towards the mini-unit, its impact on learning and engagement, and understanding of evolution. Students made statistically significant improvements on assessments regarding natural selection, reducing their number of misconceptions and slightly improving their ability to apply correct concepts. Retention scores indicate that the changes, though small, are long-lasting. Little change was found in students' attitudes towards evolution after treatment. The vast majority of students viewed the mini-unit favorably and found it to be a valuable learning opportunity, which was echoed by the classroom teachers. The mini-unit could be a valuable tool for teachers in helping students learn about natural selection and evolution in a way that is fun, motivating, and leads to conceptual change even for students with strong opposition to the theory of evolution.

The goal of the research was to determine if using argumentation, as part of the laboratory experience, would help students use their data to explain what was happening in the investigation. After students presented an oral argument in class and listened to other arguments, each individual wrote a conclusion to the laboratory investigation. The objective was to use argumentation as a means to help students gain a better understanding of the concepts covered by the laboratory investigation.

This population is predisposed to a host of comorbidities with other academically debilitating disorders such as anxiety and daytime drowsiness. This project was designed in order to assist this population of learners in a high school chemistry course. For the first treatment, students watched daily tutorial videos in order to improve comprehension, while also increasing confidence levels and decreasing anxiety. The tutorials explained chemistry concepts and demonstrated how to solve multistep chemistry problems. A second treatment was implemented in which multiple choice quizzes were interspersed throughout the tutorial videos in order to measure whether improved focus could be obtained. Data concluded that the tutorials were extremely successful. The population of ADHD students performed better on formative assessments in addition to increasing their confidence levels and decreasing anxiety levels surrounding the study of chemistry.

68856	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10035	The effects of two-column notes on science assessment scores	This project examined the effects of two-column, teacher-guided notes on student assessment scores. It also measured the value that students placed on notes and if that value changed as study time and assessment results increased. The fundamental idea was that using notes as an organized study tool would improve both test scores and the value placed on notes. Two high school science classes were used to conduct this study. All procedures and routines were kept similar between the two classes with the exception of one class using the two-column, teacher-guided note style. Students were led through four units of instruction and given quizzes, and pre and post unit tests. All assessments were in direct correlation with the material covered in the notes regardless of the note style used for each class. After each quiz and unit test students were asked to take surveys to share their opinions on the helpfulness of the notes. The surveys also measured the amount of study time each student used to prepare for assessments. Calculating the improvement on assessments for each student showed that there was not a strong correlation between the two-column note style and unit assessment scores. Quiz scores throughout the four units were eight percent higher for the Implementation Class and showed that the two-column notes helped keep students current on the unit content. A final survey determined that student motivation and lower semester goals had a significant impact on student performance and preparation for assessments.

The executive functions that support these higher-order thinking skills such as working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility are not fully developed until later grades. To determine if these executive functions could be strengthened or supported in the math classroom, a strategy notebook was implemented for the students to utilize within their daily lessons. The notebook required students to record multiple strategies to increase cognitive flexibility. Additionally, the notebook layout was designed to assist working memory and increase student inhibition when solving the math problems. The results of the treatment concluded that the notebooks did increase the executive functions of cognitive flexibility. In contrast, the strategy notebooks did not increase the executive functions of working memory and inhibition.	['education', 'mathematics', 'science', 'civilization', 'auxiliary sciences of history']
68858	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10037	The effects of a digital learning environment on the work flow of students and teacher in a language-based learning difference science classroom	Students at Middlebridge High School typically have challenges sorting and organizing their work in binders as well as completing multistep tasks. In other words, their executive functioning ability is often impaired. When attempting to complete something like a lab, or even something as simple as a small homework assignment, some of the assignment can easily go missing in the shuffle of the school day. Technology can often be sold as a 'silver bullet' to solve many of these issues. But, how well can technology really help these students? Is the current state of technology in education robust enough to handle the day-to-day issues of a pupil who is susceptible to misplacing parts, or the whole of, an assignment? Students in a chemistry class were cycled through four phases where they alternately used completely digital methods of managing a workflow to complete homework and lab assignments, and analog methods such as traditional paper with a writing implement and a physical binder organization system. As these phases were cycled through, data was collected to see how well they kept track of artifacts (items of school work) and how efficiently they completed their work. Some of the technology solutions employed were Google Drive, Google Classroom, Google Docs, GoodReader, and DocHub. In addition, the effect of these technology solutions were measured for the teacher. For these students, it turned out that technology hindered more than it helped. Some of the technology was very frustrating to use by the students, since a single bug in the software, or one user-unfriendly feature, could stop a student working in his or her tracks. Students kept track of assignments less efficiently when using digital methods of work management, evidenced by longer times of retrieval to find assignments and a lower completion rate of assignments. However, there were some promising results for the teacher's use of these digital methods. Some of the methods made it easier and faster for the teacher to grade and return work for students. The technology solutions utilized seemed immature and too fragmented for efficient use by students, seemingly turning a workflow into a 'workslow.'

One hundred and three high school general chemistry students participated in this study which took place over the course of four units. Students participated in pre and post treatments that included the Scientific Literacy Skills Exam, the Science and Engineering Practice Survey, and the Elements of Science Learning Survey. In addition, student performance was evaluated on a pre- treatment laboratory rubric scores and four treatment scores. Results suggest an attitudinal and cognitive gain in students' literacy skills gained during the 5E instructional units. The most growth occurred within the Science and Engineering Practice of planning and carrying out investigations, where the highest scores were seen in normalized gain value in rubric comparisons. In addition, this practice received the highest number of student responses to most focused on practice and highest percentage of gain during the Test for Scientific Literacy.

68860	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10039	Investigating the impact of gamification on student performance in a secondary science classroom	The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gamification on student scores, student motivation, parent and student perception, and teacher responsibilities within a secondary science classroom. This study was inconclusive in finding support for gamification improving student test scores, as all average test scores were not that different from those of previous years' data. The vast majority of students also performed within one standard deviation of their traditional test scores. Of the few students who did perform significantly worse on the gamified unit, almost half were absent from school a significant amount of time (10% or more of the unit). This study also showed that the gamification process was unsuccessful in changing the overall average of student motivational components. Students responded to Likert items with minimal change throughout the units and expressed similar views both before and after the video game was concluded. Student interest in the video game was promising in the first week of game play, but dwindled as the unit progressed as indicated by the number of students who identified the video game as the largest motivator decreased.

Students were trained specifically in composing questions using the cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy, as well as in developing experiments, inventions and models using Cothron's Four Question Strategy. Students engaged in several inquiry activities, both independently and in large and small groups, to practice these strategies and approaches. The results of this research suggest that there is a strong correlation between employing these strategies to improve students' questioning skills and the students' understanding of key concepts surrounding questioning and inquiry."

In this investigation various strategies were implemented with the purpose of improving students' confidence and motivation with multiple-choice tests in Advanced Placement chemistry. The effects of various interventions were examined for any impact on the confidence students had on multiple-choice evaluation and on their motivation to improve. The observed changes point to time allocation for tests as well as students' concurrent mastery of content and strategy as unforeseen variables that affected how their perception and belief impacted their actions.

68863	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10041	The effect of inquiry in a high school chemistry classroom on student understanding of the nature of science and their attitude, confidence, and motivation	Part of a science education is developing an understanding of the Nature of Science (NOS), the way in which scientific knowledge develops. The twenty-first century science classroom involves student engagement in inquiry learning, in which students investigate natural phenomena through practices utilized by scientists and engineers. This study investigated whether explicit instruction on the NOS and engagement in scientific inquiry investigations impacted student understanding of the way in which scientific knowledge develops. The study also investigated the effect on students' attitudes, confidence, and motivation with regards to scientific methodology. Through multiple formative assessments with constructive feedback, students most improved their confidence in and ability to design testable scientific research questions and corresponding investigative plans. The results indicated that students struggled applying their investigative research process to scientific methodology as a whole. This action research showed the importance of completing inquiry investigations in their entirety, in order for students to best learn the NOS.

68864	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10042	The effect of a supported flipped learning approach on student learning, engagement, and participation in a high school chemistry classroom	The flipped learning approach takes direct content instruction out of the classroom in order to incorporate more student-centered, inquiry-based activities that facilitate learning. In-class lectures are replaced by video lessons that students watch outside of class meeting time. Class time is reserved for practice, activities, and laboratory experiences in the presence and with the support of the teacher. Advantages of the flipped learning approach for students are control over the pace of their learning, increased one-to-one time with the teacher, seamless access to available resources, and more dynamic in-class activities to support learning. The purpose of this study was to determine if the incorporation of the flipped learning approach to instruction coupled with technology-based formative assessments affected academic achievement, student engagement, and participation in a high school chemistry classroom. A pretreatment phase of traditional instruction was followed by two separate treatment phases. The first treatment incorporated technology-based formative assessments into traditional instruction. In the second treatment phase, the flipped learning approach was used for direct content instruction in addition to the technology-based formative assessments. Students were administered pre- and post-tests as well as summative tests for each unit to assess and compare learning and achievement. Students participated in surveys and interviews to determine the impact on engagement and participation. A daily journal was kept by the teacher as part of the study as well. The results of the study revealed that there was no substantial difference in student academic achievement overall. However, students with an IEP and historically low-performing students did show an increase in test scores. Students showed increased interest in chemistry and engagement over the treatment period due to the increased time available for student-centered, inquiry activities in class. While participation rates for class activities remained unchanged, participation rates in class discussion increased. I will continue to utilize the flipped learning approach as a result of this study.	['chemistry', 'high school students', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

At the time of implementation, 50% of Big Sky High School graduates were not pursuing post-secondary education. More than 40% of students at Big Sky High School receive free and reduced lunch benefits meaning they are in an economic situation which commonly leads to low achievement and low post-secondary expectations. A thematic course of study, focused on health science, small learning community and exposure to industry professions and professionals provides a unique educational model designed to engage students, and provide them with the interpersonal support and academic foundation necessary for achieving professional success. Federally mandated standardized test scores, ACT scores, survey responses, grade point average, and free and reduced lunch status, of academy students, were compared to a control group, of non-academy students, in an effort to determine whether the Health Science Academy is improving student achievement and preparedness for college. The Health Science Academy appeared to be serving a population of students with abnormally low risk of academic failure. The impacts on academic achievement was inconclusive but impacts on student attitude appeared to be positive as were impacts on preparedness for college.

Then during each unit of study, students used the Question Formulation Technique to compile a list of questions. For homework, students examined their lists, and then identified five questions to prioritize for research in order to provide the greatest academic gain. To demonstrate academic growth, students created differentiated homework capable of teaching others in the form of their choice including songs, board games, and videos. This process was studied for its ability to improve students' attitudes about learning while at home, and to see if it encouraged self-regulated learning. The results of this study support the idea that students can use the Question Formulation Technique to differentiate physics homework. Many students improved their self-regulatory skills related to their physics education and a marginal improvement occurred in relation to student attitudes about learning while at home.

This paper assessed how implementing these strategies affected student achievement, motivation, and views towards science in a community college biology course for non-science majors. The intervention consisted of lecture and lab activities spanning the entire semester. The lab activities required students to collect, analyze, and interpret data and communicate their results. A special lab unit towards the end of the semester included field trips and inquiry-based labs that all focused on the topic of water treatment. Data for this study were collected in the form of surveys, assessments, interviews, and teacher observation. Survey results indicated that the intervention had no significant change on students' levels of motivation or views towards science. However, all students interviewed reported that the class increased their understanding of the nature of science, especially as it relates to empiricism. In addition, opinions expressed during student interviews regarding motivation were positive about the fieldtrips and lab experiments; therefore, results from interviews and surveys were sometimes contradictory. Likert items for the nature of science survey developed specifically for this study were highly correlated to one another. Students demonstrated remarkable and statistically significant gains in content knowledge after the intervention. The results from this study should be viewed cautiously due to the low sample size and the lack of a control classroom. However, they do provide meaningful information about what aspects of the intervention can continued to be used and which need modification.

68868	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10051	The effects of using literacy-based learning strategies with a growth mindset intervention on students' performance on state standardized biology concepts	My goal as a teacher is to inspire students to become life-long learners and it starts with providing them with the tools and mindset in which they can use for life's challenges. Learning and test success can both be achieved when students are provided effective learning strategies and growth mindset in which they are more cognizant of how their brains and actions can lead to learning and success. A mindset is a belief system built on one's perceptions of ability and intellect. Students rarely have a chance to explore or change their personal beliefs about intellect and learning in a high-stake testing environment. The Pennsylvania State Keystone Biology Exam is a state mandated test that students are required to take at the closure of the Biology I course I taught to tenth grade students. This study investigated the use of a literacy strategy called, close reading (where students interact with the text) and a growth mindset intervention on student performance on biology concepts. It also investigated their attitudes and motivations during the intervention. Students' performance scores were greater with the intervention and their motivations were centered on effective learning strategies. Growth mindset and the literacy strategy, close reading, increased achievement and validated the choices of the students. Students were empowered to apply effort and work for self-improvement in the instructional setting. I followed the lead of the students and realized that it was gratifying to fill the role of facilitator instead of instructor. Growth mindset intervention and the close reading literacy strategy provided transferable skills and a belief system that students can use toward contributing to a society set in the information age.

This study aims to improve middle school students' problem solving skills and increase their confidence. Project-Based Learning (PBL) was implemented in the earth science classroom with the intent to challenge students to solve real world problems through collaboration, critical thinking, and problem solving while learning to take initiative and build confidence. Units were taught in alternating phases of PBL and normal instruction. Students were assessed on their comprehension through the analysis of pre and post content tests and students' problem solving abilities were measured with a rubric to determine their individual success of applying appropriate problem solving strategies concluding each unit. Student confidence levels were determined with a survey, unit reflection, and interviews. The results indicated that the majority of the students preferred PBL instruction to normal instruction and were more effective problem-solvers concluding PBL units. The treatment of PBL instruction had a positive influence on students' confidence levels as students expressed more confidence, motivation and desire for collaboration following treatment.

Students were seated in groups of three or four and teachers were encouraged to integrate group work in most lessons. Administrators even encouraged teachers to give mostly group quizzes. While this strategy has increased student learning in many students, particularly those of the extraverted personality type, I have found that many of the introverted students that I teach struggle to learn in such a stimulating environment. This year I identified the introverted students in my classroom with a personality type survey. I then offered these students an alternative to the highly social laboratory activities and group performance tasks. This alternative focused on the same material, yet provided a quiet environment with optional social interaction and lots of space to think, read, and theorize at their own pace. Using a pre-test and a post-test I was able to observe that introverted students who received my intervention made significantly larger gains than those who did not.

68871	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10054	The effect of structured cooperative learning strategies on student achievement in science	The focus of this classroom research project was to determine if implementing structured cooperative learning groups as a teaching method would increase students' achievement in the chemistry classroom. Additionally, the investigation explores students' ability to retain the content as well as examining their overall attitude towards working in groups. A treatment and nontreatment group were established to compare the results of administering structured cooperative learning versus teacher led instruction. Test scores as well as student surveys, interviews and teacher journaling were used to measure the outcome of the treatment. Results of the action research showed no significant difference in the students' achievement in terms of test scores among the treatment and nontreatment groups. Further examination of the results however, indicated that students were more engaged in the learning process and did recognize benefits of working in structured cooperative learning group. Overall, students believed that cooperative learning did help them to remember content material and was a positive learning experience.

Lack of motivation and engagement are common problems in many high school classrooms. In addition, this apparent lack of interest may lead to low achievement. The purpose of this study was to determine whether bringing students outdoors to learn science can increase student motivation, cognitive engagement, and achievement. A secondary question investigated in the research was the effectiveness of remaining on the school grounds, and within a fifty minute class period, while learning outdoors. A small student population limited the number of study subjects to seven (N=7). The small population allowed me to treat the research as a case study and acquire detailed information about each participant and their progress. Research involved two half-day field trips to a local river access and at least sixteen outdoor, on-campus events during student's normal class periods. Data collection techniques incorporated into the study include: a science motivation survey, individual student interviews, time-on-task tally sheets, pre-and-post tests and quizzes, field notes, observations, and a teacher's journal. Data was collected before, during, and after treatments in an effort to monitor change throughout the process. Results from this study indicate that there is a positive relationship between student interest, engagement, and achievement with going outdoors to learn. Class size, age, maturity, and proximity are factors that should be considered when planning such events. Drawbacks included individual student aversion to science as a whole, and applicability of certain domains within science.

The school only offers one chemistry course: 'College Prep Chemistry'. Students' abilities in science vary greatly within each section of this course. Scores on the Pennsylvania, high-stakes biology exam range from below basic to advanced. Students' math abilities also vary as some are enrolled in AP Calculus, while others are enrolled in Algebra II. It is challenging to meet the needs of these diverse learners in a single classroom. In this research project, self-paced learning activities were created to teach advanced students challenging topics that were not part of the core curriculum and to provide remediation for students who were struggling with core topics. Video lessons and guided inquiries were used to teach the advanced topics, and video lessons alone were used as remediation. Instantaneous feedback via formative assessments was a key component of these learning activities. The research was conducted during the unit on molecules and compounds. Two of the four sections served as the treatment group and the other two sections served as the comparison group. Most students in the treatment group and all the students in the comparison group received the core curriculum. Formative assessments were given after each topic was taught to identify students who did not master the topic. Students in the treatment group who scored poorly on a formative assessment were assigned the remediation video lesson. Twelve advanced students in the treatment group learned three challenging topics in addition to the core topics. The results showed that computer-based and inquiry-based learning activities were effective tools for differentiating instruction. About three-fourths of the time advanced students mastered the additional, challenging topics. Over two-thirds of the struggling students were able to improve their understanding of a topic from basic to proficient or advanced after completing the remedial video lesson. Furthermore, students had favorable attitudes about video lessons. Student surveys showed that almost two-thirds of the students liked video lessons and more than 80% of them liked the instantaneous feedback they received from these lessons.

The goal of this study was to affordably develop a dual pH and oxygen-sensing probe that could be used in a variety of settings. This study resulted in the development of the oxygen-sensing component of such a device. This component consisted of Platinum (II)-meso-tetra (2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin (PtTFPP) suspended in a polystyrene-based matrix. A 405 nm LED excited the PtTFPP phosphorescence and a Hamamatsu Digital Color Sensor S11012-01CR recorded the resultant emission intensities of the porphyrin. A code was written for an Arduino Uno Â® microcontroller, to control the LED and color sensor, while recording the appropriate data. The oxygen-sensing component showed expected oxygen sensitivity during oxygen depletion studies.

In an attempt to improve conceptual understanding, this study examined the effectiveness of two pedagogical tools that I have used previously when teaching physics: ranking tasks and peer instruction. The use of ranking tasks has been shown to be successful in helping students understand concepts in the high-school physics classroom. In addition, peer instruction has been determined to be a pedagogical method that enhances student success. The main focus of this study was to determine if the use ranking tasks in a peer instruction environment increased conceptual understanding of mathematics. The treatment was comprised of several peer instruction ranking task activities throughout a unit on linear relations. The activities involved an individual completion of a paper-and-pencil ranking task followed by a small group discussion and re-completion of the task with group input. After both the individual and group phases, students were prompted to record the confidence they had in their answer. Data collection for this study included a pre- and post-concept test for the treatment unit and for comparison, a non-treatment unit as well. To triangulate the data, a questionnaire aimed at revealing student perceptions on ranking tasks, peer instruction, and mathematics in general was given post-treatment. Furthermore, several students were randomly selected to participate in an interview after the treatment was completed. Finally, each ranking task also yielded insight to the effectiveness of the treatment through the rate of successful completion and student confidence. The results indicated that ranking tasks were successful in improving student conceptual understanding. When combined with peer instruction, the effectiveness of ranking tasks was even more prominent. Due to these positive outcomes, peer instruction ranking tasks will be an activity that I will regularly implement in my future mathematics classes. On a more general level, peer instruction is a model that I plan to use more often to enable students to learn from themselves and succeed with each other.	['science', 'mathematics']

Students from a small rural high school in Northeast Kansas (N=49) were evaluated. Class sizes ranged from three to sixteen. The data collection techniques included individual interviews, student surveys, Classroom Assessment Techniques (CAT) assessments, a teacher reflection journal, student writing samples assessed with both a Content and Ideas Rubric and Curriculum Based Measurement (CBM), and comparison of pre-test and post-test scores. For one week, students learned through traditional classroom teaching methods in a comparison unit delivering content about Yellowstone National Park. It was followed by six weeks of implementing SDI, in which students learned about the biology, geology, and chemistry of the thermal features of Yellowstone National Park. Finally, for two weeks, students studied about the models scientists use to explain a primordial Earth using CPR. Results revealed that CPR was very effective in increasing students scientific comprehension based on normalized gain. Responses from student surveys indicated that they enjoyed using this approach to technical writing. Results were inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of the SDI approach to technical writing. There was no significant increase in student comprehension based on normalized gain when SDI was compared to the comparison group. In addition, student surveys indicated that they did not prefer this method to other technical writing approaches. More study is needed to determine how to best implement SDI in a high school science classroom.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of inquiry based instruction on student achievement and student attitude in high school Chemistry. Tests, surveys and interviews were used to compare data from one school year to the next. Quantitative data was gathered through a series of tests. These tests were used to determine gains in content knowledge and ability to solve problems. Surveys and interviews were used to measure qualitative data regarding the attitudes about learning chemistry. The control group was taught by traditional instruction through the use of lecture, note-taking, and textbook guided assignments. The experimental group was taught by the use of inquiry based lessons containing daily group activities, lab development, white-boarding and self-discovery tactics. The data in this study indicated that utilizing inquiry based instruction in the high school Chemistry classroom is an effective method for increasing content knowledge and positive attitudes about Chemistry.

This project evaluated the effectiveness of using project based learning in an Earth science classroom. Specifically, student learning, engagement and interest, and connections made to student's lives were observed. Using two different units with two different groups of students, it was found that project based learning can have an impact on student learning. Although, in this case the project based format could not be considered the major factor that influenced student growth. Findings did suggest that there was a positive influence on student engagement and interest in Earth science.

Outdoor educational activities, as well as guest speakers from the community were used to supplement current curriculum. The purpose was to investigate student motivation and attitude towards learning science, their opinions of being outdoors and outdoor learning, and level of concern for the environment. Students participated in water quality monitoring at a local stream, learned about native Montana wildlife in a greenhouse at our local community garden, went on a nature hike, and collected and identified macroinvertebrates at the Woodson Ranch in Laurin, Montana. Results showed that student interest and attitudes towards the outdoors, as well as test scores, increased significantly after being exposed to outdoor learning.

They then established a claim and constructed a conceptual model to explain the scientific concepts in their science inquiry project. The goal of this project was to create an academic atmosphere that promoted creativity and critical thinking and enabled the students to solve real-world problems. This capstone measured student motivation to complete inquiry projects in the classroom. I wanted to find out if students were motivated to complete class work to please adults or for their own intrinsic reasons. I hoped students wanted to complete work for their own intrinsic reasons. By the use of their own creativity and imagination would solve problems and tasks at hand, they would internalize concepts and gain a deeper understanding of the material. If students completed because they wanted to solve their own questions and not because an adult instructed them to do so, they retain information instead of going through the motions of filling out a worksheet and turning it in for a grade. The use of formative and performance assessment measured their academic growth and Likert surveys explored their comfort level with the use of inquiry in the classroom as they constructed questions, gathered data, and made claims. Three key factors helped me transition the class from worksheet and lecture driven instruction to the use of inquiry. This was the use of formative assessment, classroom structure, and the implementation of peer-review.

The field element of the research project included identification of salt marsh vegetation and measurement of soil salinity along three transects. Two first year high school biology classes were tested for student motivation towards learning biology, achievement in the relevant ecology unit and overall perception of the environment through pre- and post-intervention attitudinal surveys, summative evaluations, short answer essays, and teacher notes. The treatment group (N=9) studied the salt marsh ecology curriculum over a one month period and participated in two field days in the marsh while the non-treatment group (N=15) was exposed to the curriculum in the classroom only. It was discovered that treatment students had increased motivation toward learning biology. Achievement and perspective on environmental preservation remained fairly unchanged regardless of participation in the experiential research intervention. These factors together show that while experiential field work does not have significantly better results than standard ecology curriculum, it certainly was shown to be just as good as traditional classroom practices. When the geographic proximity and local significance of salt marsh preservation was considered, there was a strong argument that outdoor classroom activities in the marsh were worth pursuing. At the very least they were just as worthy as typical classroom based lessons and therefore should be considered as a worthwhile endeavor.

This project was designed to determine if dedicating a set amount of time each week to teaching and practicing literacy skills in a Chemistry classroom would increase student's scientific writing ability. Specifically, would students be better able to communicate scientific information using evidence, data, and content specific vocabulary terms. Formative assessments, peer reviewing, and discussion strategies were utilized over a six week period. The results indicate that these strategies are effective in increasing the writing ability of students in a science classroom. Additionally, students indicated a positive value of learning writing skills in a science classroom.

68886	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10072	The effect of using Nearpod as a tool of active learning in the high school science classroom	A good portion of what must be learned in the introductory science classroom is most easily conveyed during lecture. Unfortunately students tend to be more passive during lecture than active. This often results in the instructor being unsure of what students understand until it is time for a summative assessment. When active learning strategies are implemented during a lecture some students feel uncomfortable participating and the instructor is unable to determine how successful the lecture has been. This project investigated the impact of the interactive presentation tool Nearpod on the success of high school science students. Classes were introduced to new material using Nearpod or PowerPoint with active learning strategies. Student achievement was measured using Pretests and Posttests, daily quizzes, classroom, and laboratory activities. Student and teacher attitude was measured using surveys and journals. Data collection for this project included Pretests and Posttests to measure any differences in the amount of information learned between the two types of presentations. Grades on daily assignments were considered to see if there was any difference between Treatment and Nontreatment groups. Student surveys were given to see if students had any preferences on which presentation program they felt more comfortable with, learned more with, and which one their teacher taught better with. The students were also given the opportunity to express what they liked and disliked about each presentation program. Teacher interviews were conducted to determine how successful and helpful Nearpod was in the classroom. A teacher journal was created to follow the morale of the teacher through this process. The results of this project indicated that Nearpod does not have a great effect on student grades when compared to active learning with the presentation program PowerPoint. However, students and teachers both prefer the active learning opportunities provided by Nearpod. Active learning seems to be a common factor of how much students learn, not a computer program with opportunities for active participation.

68887	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10073	An investigation of the preparation of science teachers to incorporate engineering design principles into their science curricula	Incorporating engineering design principles into science curricula is part of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) with an intended purpose of moving science education forward to the 21st century. This study examined teacher preparation, attitudes, and level of knowledge about the engineering design process and how it can be incorporated into their science curricula. Teachers were surveyed for their perceptions of and experiences with engineering concepts. In general, science teachers need more professional development in order to meet the goal of properly incorporating engineering design into their science class(es) regardless of whether they live in a state that has adopted NGSS or not. Professional development that makes a difference is focused and on-going embedding engineering experiences with content very much in the same way that teachers are expected to teach their students. Professional, on-going and expert support proved to be a key element to the science teacher's development as an effective educator.

68889	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10075	The effects of science literacy instruction on student ability to gather evidence to support scientific claims	The purpose of this research is to determine if increased focus on science literacy improve student ability to gather evidence to support scientific claims. The lessons focusing on scientific literacy consisted of annotating a scientific text, participating in a Socratic seminar within the Paideia method, and constructing claim, evidence, reason (CER) charts in groups. The cycle used to complete these lessons utilized PONG (Problem, Observe, Negotiate, Goal), which supports teachers by structuring lessons as a repeated process where students construct and critique arguments, moving toward a goal. Three non-treatment units were followed by three treatment units in a 9th grade honors physical science class at Franklin Towne Charter High School in Philadelphia. It was found that treatment had a positive impact on student performance on student ability to write argumentative essays and write analyzes when given scientific data. Mean essay scores increased by 18% and mean data analysis scores increased 20% during treatment. Additionally, by the third round of treatment over 80% of students indicated they were confident in their abilities on all survey questions relating to writing argumentative essays and data analyses. Students also completed pre-test and post-test CER explanations based on common misconceptions before and after each unit. Scientific literacy PONG cycles were less effective in helping students use evidence to support claims for problems based on common misconceptions. If anything, it seemed that the treatment simply helped students to better rationalize an incorrect claim. Additionally, it was determined that student attitude toward treatment type (annotation, Socratic seminar, and CER charts) did not differ based on student learning style (visual, auditory, or kinesthetic). All student types favored Socratic seminars and CER charts in groups over completing annotations. Overall, scientific literacy treatment was found to be effective. In the future I intend to alter treatment by only implementing scientific literacy PONG cycles in more concrete units like The Nature of Science, Forces, Energy, and Waves as opposed to units involving more abstract thinking like Motion, Matter, and Intro to Chemistry due to the developmental state of 9th grade students. Additionally, while student attitude toward completing annotations was negative overall, I am not confident this means inclusion of annotations is ineffective. Students indicated that they did not like annotations due to their experiences using them in English class. In the future I will implement annotations under a different name to distance the scientific annotation process from those completed in other classes to determine if attitude changes. Additionally, when implementing treatment in non-honors classes, I intend to scaffold treatment more by completing annotations as a teacher lead assignment, including more guiding questions during Socratic seminar, and using heterogeneous grouping when completing CER charts.

Prior to this action research project, students in this class were accustomed only to lecture, then exam, methods. Literature reviews indicated that case studies were effective tools in science classes. Therefore, pre- and post- assessments, formative assessment techniques, student surveys, student interviews, and instructor journaling were monitored and assessed for changes in student learning, retention, and value. The action research-based approach was replicated in two sections of the Applied Science class. Quantitative data collected during the project was conflicting. One section demonstrated a statistically significant change in learning, whereas the other did not. Both sections had insufficient evidence to suggest a statistical change in retention. However, qualitative data from students and the instructor overwhelmingly indicated that the case study method is an effective tool to support student learning techniques.

68891	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10077	The effect of group created lab designs on students' understanding of content and science practices	Community college health and engineering students often have difficulty understanding physics on a conceptual level, as well as general science practices used in experimentation and data analysis. This often leads to low levels of confidence in both, which effects classroom moral. For my intervention, I have students design their own physics labs as a means of having them think deeply about content and lab analysis, and measure the outcomes on both their understanding of each, as well as confidence. To measure student understanding of course content, each lab will have an associated pre and post-test to compare. I will also make use of their first exam to compare to past semesters, and the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to compare nationally. Growth in confidence makes use of pre-intervention and post-intervention surveys, as well as student interviews. Growth in data analysis and science practices use pre- and post-tests, given before and after the intervention. Through the intervention I have observed increases in content understanding, as evident by increases in average pre-posttests scores for each lab. Students also showed growth in the normalized gains on the FCI (higher then past semesters and the national average). Student confidence also increased in terms of both their understanding of physics, science and data analysis. Student understanding of analyzing data was also greatly increased, and is what I consider the most successful part of the intervention.

The teachers also may not want to be responsible for devices that might be damaged or lost. To engage with students that are always plugged in, it is necessary to create a bridge that connects the students' interest in technology with a tool that creates positive outdoor educational experiences.

A professional development program, Understanding Newly Learned Environmental Science Skills (UNLESS), occurred over the course of the 2015-16 school year with a self-selected cohort of environmental educators. This action-research based study examined the question, What are the effects of a professional development program on scientific inquiry on educators' beliefs, self-efficacy, and instruction related to inquiry? These educators learned from science experts and through collaborative inquiry-based lessons shared by the cohort. The course of the program was directed by the interests of the educators. Methods to collect data included surveys, observations, concept maps, interviews, and the facilitator's journal notes. At the conclusion of the UNLESS program, the data showed an increase in participants' confidence, attitude, and instruction related to inquiry. Participants went from less than 20% of their programs including a student-driven investigation to 52%. Indicators of inquiry-orientation seen in observations also increased. While educators still described some ongoing challenges to doing inquiry with students at the conclusion of the program, other challenges were no longer reported. Suggestions for the future of this program are shared along with implications for how to support environmental educators in their pursuit to become more inquiry-based teachers.

68895	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10083	The effects on student academic achievement and student self-confidence of a course-specific textbook written for applied electronics math 2	This research project was developed from the need for a good, affordable textbook for Applied Electronics Math 2 at Madison Area Technical College. When no suitable textbook was found, I chose to write a one specifically designed for that course. This study was motivated by two major research questions in relation to that text: (1) what is the effect on student achievement of using this text? (2) Does the additional emphasis on basic concepts enhance student self-confidence in field-related applications? Data for this project was collected over a period of three semesters. This included not only student grades for homework, quizzes, and exams but information on students' self-confidence levels with respect to mathematics in math and related electronics classes collected at the beginning and end of each semester. Student opinions of the textbook were collected and evaluated using surveys and interviews. Academic scores of the three test classes as compared to a baseline of previous classes taught without a textbook showed expected improvement. However, the greatest improvement was in the self-confidence levels of a majority of the students. Math anxiety was greatly reduced and students declared themselves more prepared to take on the mathematics in their other electronics classes. Student comments about the textbook itself were very favorable. The findings from this research suggest that an affordable book written for a particular course can have a positive effect on both students' academic success in that course and their self-confidence in related areas.

Social pressures can have heavy impacts on a student's academic motivation and achievement, and social development. In order to provide a space to work on having productive peer interactions, I designed a classroom research project that incorporated leadership initiatives into the enrichment activities at Teton Afterschool. Leadership initiatives used were teambuilding activities and group discussions and debriefs. Students participated in one science unit without leadership initiatives, followed by a unit where each lesson began with a teambuilder. The focus question for this project was: What are the effects of introduction leadership initiatives into enrichment time of Teton Afterschool? Data collected showed statistically significant improvements in science content quizzes and self-reported leadership confidence surveys between units. There was also a decrease in the number of disciplinary actions that had to be taken by staff during the leadership unit. Student interviews described a range of attitudes about leadership, and mainly positive attitudes about science lessons and Teton Afterschool in general. These results show that the inclusion of teambuilding in programs for upper elementary and middle school students has potentially very positive effects.

In order to create interactive reading passages that engage students in scientific literacy and to connect science educators with current science from all over the world through scientist and engineer interviews, I created the Journeys concept, pilot and delivery method. I then gauged its NGSS alignment, usefulness and relevance with science teachers based on teacher preliminary surveys, pre-interviews and their resulting feedback using a pilot Journey called Researching Dolphins. Each Journey reading passage focuses on students researching various topics highlighted in NGSS and culminates real and new science issues, engineering education and citizen science opportunities. The pilot Journey focuses on High School Life Science and integrates other standards including Science & Engineering Practices. The process and result of my journey to create Journeys, or interactive NGSS aligned reading passages that integrate current science and engineering research for secondary science teachers and their classrooms, is provided.

To narrow this question down, I focused on the classroom as a potential site for change, and researched pedagogical practices and classroom materials that could help teachers achieve a goal of teaching for social justice. Using Action Research, I examined the effect of using learner-centered teaching methods and relevant social justice themed content with my Writing 101 students, to assess if they would be influenced to care about a specific social justice issue. Students examined the dominant use of ""Standard English"" in the classroom, and the effect that can have on students who do not speak ""Standard English"" as their home language. I asked students to question whose language is allowed in the classroom, whose is not allowed, and who decides whose language gets to be spoken. I administered a pre and post survey, collected student writing, and used my observations to assess results. I found that many students in the course did shift their opinions. It appeared that using ""adult learning centers"" along with a variety of other teaching methods contributed to students' shifting opinions. This study adds to the small body of knowledge about teaching practices and materials that work towards social justice, but also points to the need for more qualitative research in this area."

The quality and organization of class notes was a major concern among teaching staff at Agora Cyber Charter School. Students attending the Agora Learning Center were provided with note-taking workshops to teach and encourage them to take and organize notes during virtual classes. After workshops and follow-up, the treatment showed minimal impact on student perception of note-taking and no significant impact on math performance as displayed in data from math assessments and online surveys.

68902	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10091	The effects of standards-based grading in the middle school science classroom	In the beginning years of my teaching career, not much thought was put into a grading system. It was assumed that a grade was given as a point value that was assigned to a task and the accumulated points over a grading period determined a student's grade. A conversation about standards-based grading introduced new ideas about grading to me that seemed to solve the problems of subjective, point value grades given to students. This project implemented a standards-based grading (SBG) system into a seventh grade middle school science classroom for the period of 5 months. The goal of the project was to determine the effects of SBG on student comprehension, motivation, and attitude towards grading. Curriculum standards were broken down into defined learning goals. Each learning goal had a 4-point proficiency rubric and many opportunities for students to prove their learning mastery. Students were encouraged to reassess as many times as they wish to encourage learning, rather than working towards a grade. Data were collected through pre and post-treatment surveys, student interviews, teacher observations, learning goal mastery, and pre and post-treatment science content tests. The results showed that the implementation of SBG had no statistically significant changes on comprehension, motivation, and attitude towards grading. However, the majority of students preferred using SBG rubrics as a form of grading in the science classroom. Many of the foundation ideas of SBG, such as rubrics, sharing learning goals, and aligning assessments with instruction, will be continued to be used in my classroom for years to come.

There were 36 students involved in this study from two college prep physical science classes in a large, diverse high school in Sharonville, Ohio. Students used scientific notebooks and participated in scientific inquiry lessons for two physical science units, Forces and Energy. Students were given a pre and post test for each unit and their notebooks were observed for completion. An engagement observation tool was used to record engagement of students during lessons. Students' academic achievement improved from the pre to the post test with both units. Students showed 90% engagement during the seven lessons observed. Lessons including scientific inquiry activities with the use of science notebooks have shown a positive impact in achievement and engagement.

I watched the demand for cells phones grow from a few students having them in my class to every student in my classes having a smart phone. You will see students taking selfies or checking Facebook on a regular basis. I set up rules requiring them to put their phones in a box at the beginning of class, but this only worked for a short amount of time. I decided to incorporate their phone use into my lessons with hopes that this would alleviate the constant war that has developed in my classroom. We used the smartphones to take tests on test banks that I made on Kahoot, and Quizlet. My primary action research challenge was 'How can I incorporate cell phones to aide in student comprehension.' I was curious to know whether my students would do better on tests if they used their smartphones to take them. My research questions were: 1) What effects will the use of smartphones have on test scores? 2) Does the use of smartphones change student attitudes towards taking tests? 3) Will the use of smartphones help student comprehension?

When working with students who are English Language Learners or struggle with vocabulary acquisition, this strategy is thought to be very successful. Students on the Flathead Indian Reservation often struggle with vocabulary acquisition. In addition to this, some Native American students are also labeled English Language Learners; thus, the amount of explicit instruction was increased over several units. Significant gains were observed in each of the three units, but because these gains did not correlate with the increase of instruction, the quantitative data was inconclusive. These gains do indicate that the baseline of 22% instructional time was an adequate amount of instruction to improve scientific vocabulary acquisition.

When they are asked to teach themselves something new or apply content they've learned, these otherwise high achieving students, frequently underperform. They have a strong aversion to failure and rather than risk getting something wrong they avoid answering. This aversion to difficult tasks and fear of failure is consistent with a fixed mindset. In an effort to develop growth-minded intelligence in my students I implemented the QuIVERS teaching method developed by Montana Teacher of the Year, Paul Andersen (2012b). This teaching method combines the 5E learning system with a blended learning cycle to create a student-led learning environment. Along with measuring mindset, I also measured academic achievement, student resilience when working on difficult problems and student experience. As a result of the QuIVERS intervention, students who had an initial fixed mindset shifted towards growth-minded thinking. Students also developed strong content knowledge (especially academically weak students) and worked on difficult problems longer. Despite thinking it was difficult, students had lots of positive feedback about the method.

Several techniques for improving instruction have been introduced over the past few years. One such technique is the flipped classroom model. This project investigated the effectiveness of the flipped model. Over the course of two units, student watched video lessons at home and class time was used for hands-on activities, laboratories and doing activities that traditionally would be considered homework in the presence of a teacher that can answer questions. The results of this study were then compared to a class taught using traditional techniques to determine the effectiveness.

Lack of student interest did not allow full implementation of the pilot program, but a similar program was implemented over five weeks of instructional time with high school students enrolled in blended learning physical science and chemistry courses. Data collection included a pre-intervention survey and post-intervention survey, including Likert-like items. Other data sources were an analysis of the quality and quantity of asynchronous discussion posts, student and instructor interviews, a VOH journal, and VOH artifacts. In addition, to identify the reasons why students did not participate in the pilot program, a follow-up survey was sent to the initial group of students. Findings showed that the virtual office hours successfully increased student engagement and were overall a well-received addition to the course. Conditions needed for successful implementation of future virtual office hour programs were described, including the need to consider technical and logistical concerns, and the need to consider the specific goals of the program. To support all the observed benefits of implementing virtual office hours, ideal conditions for success are a well-informed instructor, asynchronous discussion forums supporting the development of student questions.

The methods used assessed students' content knowledge, attitudes, and confidence. Students were provided with a variety of ancillary methods relating to content material and real-world applications. The overall treatment incorporated three units of study. The first unit of study was on the human population and incorporated basic textbook content material. The second unit of study was on environmental health. The second unit used the pedagogy of the first unit. In addition, students collaborated on ancillary textbook materials which facilitated the connection between content knowledge and real-world applications. The third unit of study was on soil and agriculture. The pedagogy in this unit included all teaching methods from the first two units. Additional ancillaries were incorporated into this unit in the form of a case study, a documentary, and a current event. The purpose of additional ancillaries beyond the text was to further the connection of environmental science content material to real-world applications, and to improve students' attitudes and confidence. Data were collected using student pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments, surveys, and interviews. In addition, teacher data were collected using classroom teacher and colleague observations. Observations were employed to gain understanding of students' interest and academic needs and to assess teacher pedagogy practices. The data indicated an overall improvement of students' understanding of content material. Data also indicated an overall decline in students' attitudes and confidence at the conclusion of this research project.

The participants were members in one of my Cornerstone Classes at Florida SouthWestern State College that was randomly selected. The data collected during this study were student surveys, student interviews, researcher observations, and pre and post of the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory. The researcher provided explicit instruction, conducted a pre-post California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory, and facilitated two debates. The data collected included pre and post California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) test, observations, course evaluation, survey, and interviews. The overall results of the study showed that students benefited from the exercise of debating particularly when debating opposing points of view. Students' disposition to be critical thinkers improved as a result of debating. Debating, regardless of the topic, help enhance students' overall open-mindedness, inquisitiveness, analyticity, systematicity, and confidence of reasoning.

My action research explored if current events in an Earth science classroom can increase students' scientific literacy, content knowledge, and engagement. Students were given instruction without using a current world event and with using a world current event. Through the use of multiple-choice tests, student surveys, observations to analyze how the instruction affects student scientific literacy, content knowledge, and engagement. The analysis shows that the only significant change in students is engagement during the current event instruction. Future action research plans would investigate how the use of technology can engage students, affect content knowledge, and build scientific literacy in students.

Student attitudes and confidence were assessed before and after replacing lectures and standard lab procedures with Harkness style class discussions and inquiry-based exercises. Student scores on regular unit tests, homework assignments and other exercises were used to assess the effect of the new teaching techniques on student performance. Students did not show improvement in attitude and confidence but their performance and overall understanding improved. Students generally enjoyed the new approach and would like to continue using discussions instead of traditional lectures.

Two ninth-grade Earth science classes were given two different projects. The first project had students create a fourth-grade book concerning weather related topics and they presented their books to local elementary students. The second project had students prepare and present a PowerPoint to a community panel by discussing climate change and specifically if they feel humans are the cause. The community panel consisted of a United States Forest Service firefighter, farmer, and mother. While one class did the project the other class was instructed using conventional methods. Students were assessed and data was analyzed via pre and post test, surveys, teacher observation, quizzes, and artifacts produced during projects. Results showed an increase in understanding for students who had higher achievement levels and were engaged during the course of the project.

With over 50% of our students receiving free or reduced lunch and nearly 20% of our students in the English for Speakers of Other Languages program, teachers face many challenges. Pass rates in chemistry and its associated End-of-Course, Standards of Learning exam have missed state and county targets for many years. For this reason I designed a program to provide extra support to a pre-identified group of at-risk students. Algebra 1 is a pre-requisite to be enrolled in chemistry and the class relies heavily on its use. Any student who has trouble in algebra is likely to struggle in chemistry. At the beginning of the school year I identified all of my students who received a D in algebra or failed the corresponding state exam in algebra. I asked these students to participate in a voluntary program for extra review, practice and remediation. This was accomplished during a non-academic study period and was available for one hour, once a week, for the duration of the school year. Pre- and post-assessment data was collected to analyze the effectiveness of the program. In addition students' attitudes were investigated as being a large part of student's success in the classroom. Surveys, interviews and journals were used to track student changes in attitude over the year. What developed throughout the program was a strong student-teacher relationship in the small number of students who participated. Results indicated that students were able to perform near the level of their peers with a stronger algebra background if they participated in the treatment. More than half of the students who met the criterion for inclusion in the program chose to participate. These students' normalized gains were far above the non-treatment group giving strong support to the success of the program. Students also showed gains in their attitudes about school in general.

Sophomore students at Lewisville High School Harmon completed concept checks in a flipped Pre-AP Chemistry class as a means to acquire more content throughout the duration of the 18-week course. Students viewed lecture videos and displayed their understanding of chemistry topics presented in the videos through the completion of concept checks. The effectiveness of teacher-created concept checks was determined from data analysis of student interviews and surveys, summative assessment scores, and response data from concept checks. Through completion of this classroom research project, I gained insight on the effectiveness of teacher-created lecture videos and concept checks utilized in my flipped course.

It seemed that students were easily distracted when they were not actively participating in activities. In an effort to find a solution to this problem, a flipped classroom was implemented in three general chemistry classes during the spring semester. For four weeks, during two out of seven chemistry units, the students were asked to watch informational videos outside of class and participate in engaging activities during class, a 'flip' from traditional methods. There were no statistical differences in the summative assessment scores between the students in the flipped classroom versus the traditionally taught classroom. However, students gained a sense of responsibility for their learning, and I have become a more reflective teacher as a result of this project.

They work through the procedure and analysis, but upon receiving back graded labs they often disregard the feedback since the grade has already been given. I believed this put them at a disadvantage on assessments since they would never correct their misconceptions. I wanted to know if students would learn better if they received instant feedback during the labs so that they could correct their misconceptions when it was relevant to their grades. My focus question was to see the effect would be of immediate feedback during laboratory exercises via Excel spreadsheet. As a subquestion, I wanted to know specifically what effect this immediate feedback would have on their summative assessment scores. Research was performed on two sections of physics students over four units of study. Two of the units had laboratories in which feedback would be given in the traditional manner in which students complete a lab and it is them graded and returned to them to review. Two of the units had laboratories in which feedback is automatically given via a preprogrammed Excel spreadsheet which would return a smiley face for correct cell values and a frowny face for incorrect cell values. To study the effects on student attitudes I had students take a survey on their feelings about physics, laboratories, and laboratory feedback both before and after the action research. Students were also chosen at random and asked to participate in a short interview to probe deeper into student attitudes. To measure student performance on summative assessments, unit concept inventory test was given before and after each unit. Both survey responses and test scores were analyzed to see if there was any significant difference due to the instant feedback given during laboratories. The results of the analysis showed that though students found the laboratories enriching in their visualization of the concepts, there was inconclusive evidence to suggest and difference in student attitudes or in student test performance. During interviews students expressed that they found laboratories not very useful for the purposes of studying for quizzes and tests, as laboratories seem to require a different set of skills than those normally required for a classical multiple choice or written assessment.

This vocational instruction is largely hands-on instruction. This project examined whether increasing that style of learning into a science/engineering classroom would increase student learning as well as student engagement in the subject of technology/engineering. Problem based hands-on teaching has been shown to provide a sound foundation for instruction and student engagement. Hands-on experimental activities have been at the core of science classrooms and administration has lobbied teachers to expand hands-on integration between academic and vocational departments. This study covered four technology/engineering frameworks, (thermal systems, electrical systems, fluid systems and communication technology), and worked with four vocational areas to help cover that content, (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, Electrical, Automotive Technology and Electronics). The treatment groups received hands-on instruction in a vocational area, and the comparison groups received traditional classroom learning. Quantitative data showed that both the treatment and comparison groups increased post-assessment scores; however the treatment group did not significantly outperform the comparison group. That said, qualitative data gathered from student journals, surveys and interviews delivered an overwhelming response that hands-on instruction heightens student engagement and is the preferred method that students which to be taught. It is essential to increase this style of learning between the vocational and academic departments at PRVTHS to help with student enrollment, as well as increasing student engagement to improve student performance.

68921	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10111	The impact of the flipped classroom on learning and problem solving of ninth grade biology students	The students in my biology classes, like most students in today's world, struggle with problem solving skills and learning difficult biological concepts such as cell biology and genetics. Their prior educational learning experience has been teacher centered with lectures and note taking, then memorizing facts from their notes to pass a test. More classroom time is needed for application, group activities, and development of problem solving abilities. The problem with achieving that is the lack of time in a 53 minute class period to teach concepts and then apply those concepts to problem solving. This project investigates the effects of changing the traditional method of lecture and note taking during class to using online instructional resources at home for homework. This will free up class time for more question and answer time, application, group activities and collaboration as well as problem solving exercises. This approach has been termed the 'flipped' classroom method. The students were assigned weekly online resources such as animations and video lectures for homework along with associated written work. During class time, the students were engaged in various activities where they applied what they hopefully learned the night before. Time was allotted for question and answer sessions, clarification, and when needed individual help from me. Data collection during this project included pre and post treatment student surveys, pre and post treatment unit tests, student self-evaluations following activities. In addition, the students completed post treatment anonymous written feedback. Six students were interviewed both before and after the treatment was implemented. The pre and post treatment formal unit assessments showed significant gains over all in learning and problem solving. However, that is to be expected with or without the flipped classroom because the concepts covered during the project were new to the students. The pre test scores were very low due to lack of prior knowledge and the post test scores were higher after the students were exposed to the concepts for six weeks each unit. The resulting qualitative data suggested that the flipped classroom approach improved student attitude significantly even though their attitudes were already good and also improved student engagement during class. Students appreciated having more time to ask questions and more time with me if needed. They also appreciated the collaborative group projects and felt they learned more with the help of their peers. Even though the data showed the students had a slight preference for the traditional classroom because that is what they have always had, they overwhelming preferred a combination of the two teaching methods. After the project was completed, many students asked if I would continue giving them internet resources because it helped them learn so much better.

The project focused on determining whether the use of current events influenced 'aha' moments, and if it influenced student learning. Students were given a relevant current events article to read during three separate units of study. Writing prompts followed each of the three articles. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of current events in the classroom, students were surveyed and interviewed, class discussion followed the writing prompts, teacher journaling took place, and the students were assessed on corresponding free response questions on the three units' summative assessments. Collected data suggests that currents events help students understand the relevance of science in their lives and also have a positive impact on student learning.

This may be a result of past science classes that are not engaging, motivating, or that punish students for failure. To improve student success and scientific literacy, I utilized gamification and the 5E learning cycle (QuIVERS) with high school honors chemistry students. The goal of this project was to use a variety of compelling aspects of video games and incorporate them into my classroom to improve my student's success at learning chemistry and to foster their identities as scientists. The intervention was inspired by Paul Andersen, who developed the QuIVERS method for his AP Biology classes. Within this cycle students engage in a question, explore an investigation, watch a video, read an elaborative reading, review, and take a summary quiz. In my intervention, I incorporated the following characteristics of gamification: self-paced advancement, failure normalization, badges for completing challenges, and levelling. The study began with a non-treatment control group from the previous year. Class averages, formative assessment scores, and summative assessment scores were recorded for comparing with the treatment group. Two units of the study, nomenclature and chemical reactions were used at the treatment units. The assessments included three nomenclature quizzes and a multiple choice test for the nomenclature unit, and a balancing equations quiz and multiple choice test for the chemical reaction unit. Overall, the impact on student learning and student identity as a scientist was inconclusive and it appeared that the intervention had no significant impact on either. Changes were small in many of the measured standards. Students seemed to be most impacted in their confidence and willingness to learn in environments where failure was encouraged. The majority of students found the intervention positive and helpful. My results matched the research that demonstrated that student engagement, achievement, and motivation all can be affected positively by high-quality games and holistic classroom game environments. Because of the importance of careful design, the time needed to incorporate a successful gamification intervention may, for some, outweigh the possible benefits. An increase in the duration of the intervention could be used to see if there is a stronger impact on student learning and to help foster identities in science content could be incorporated in ways that involve more science practices and inquiry.

The first model uses a single fluid three component formulation of the biofilm to model the movement within the biofilm in 1D. This is done using a system partial differential equations to model the expansion or contraction of the biofilm in order for the three components to reach an ideal concentration. The model is further refined to include separate velocities for each component as well as using zeroth order kinetics for the growth. In order to solve this system of partial differential equations a finite difference method with an upwind scheme was used to solve the system numerically. The second model is an energy based approach done in both 1D and 2D. An energy, in the case the Flory-Huggins free energy density, is used to describe the interactions of different components within the biofilm. The Cahn-Hilliard equation with the Flory-Huggins free energy density is used to model the separation of the biofilm into two phases. A brief derivation of both the Flory-Huggins equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation is given using a lattice model and thermodynamic properties. The Flory-Huggins equation is modified slightly for simplicity. A movement energy is also added to the Flory-Huggins equation in order to allow the polymers within the biofilm to move around the domain. In the 1D case the numerical solution was found using finite differences with an upwind scheme similar to the first model. The 2D case is more difficult to solve due to the extra dimension. Due to this the projection method was used to solve part of the system of equations and finite difference using central difference instead of upwind is used to solve the rest.

Ecological concerns have led to numerous studies of the effects grazing has on these ecologically important, easily damaged ecosystems. Exclosure-based research has thoroughly examined the effects of livestock on riparian ecosystem health and function, but failed to investigate the potential for exclosures to intensify adverse effects of use at their boundaries, which could lead to overestimation of their benefits and impair their efficacy in management. This study attempts to supplement existing research by characterizing potential impacts, making exclosures a more informed and effective management strategy. Study exclosures were located on grazed public lands in southwest Montana. Riparian vegetative cover and channel morphology response variables were measured inside the exclosure and in two grazed reaches, one placed 0 to 20 m and one >50 m from the exclosure to capture differences in the spatial extent and severity of any impacts due to differences in livestock behavior caused by the exclosure's influence. Findings were that (1) results were consistent with previous exclosure studies using the same response variables to compare grazed and exclosed areas, (2) significant differences in herbaceous cover, bare ground cover, channel width, and bank angle between the two grazed subreaches were greater than corresponding grazed/exclosed comparisons, indicating that impacts to the subreach adjacent to the exclosure that are greater than corresponding improvements within, (3) spatially inconsistent impact zones within and among sites made it impossible to describe an overall impact zone adjacent to exclosures, but impacts to channel morphology, herbaceous cover, and bare ground occurred within 8 m of the exclosure, and within 2 m for bank angle, (4) data didn't support predicted relationships between impact severity and exclosure duration, size, or stocking rates, most likely due to the many other influencing factors that were not measured. Evidence supporting existence of exclosure-caused impacts should inform exclosure use and make it a more effective management tool, especially when considered in the context of how these impacts might encumber specific management goals.

Distributed teacher leadership has been identified as having the potential to improve schools, however, little is known about the pathways teachers take to move into leadership roles, how schools go about distributing leadership, or the supports that help teachers develop leadership skills. There is also a need to better determine how teacher leadership development and progression is supported through graduate programs. This research was a two-level quantitative-qualitative research. The first level used a survey to explore the leadership roles teachers filled and the pathways teacher leaders took to move into leadership roles. The second level focused on creating case studies of eleven MSSE program graduates. Case study data was used to further examine and provide deeper insights into the pathways teachers used and the motivators or supports that encouraged them to move into or take on leadership roles. Case study data was also used to determine the extent to which participants perceived the MSSE program supported or contributed to their leadership development and progression. Specific supports provided by the program were identified. The study provided evidence that the pathways taken by teachers tend to follow two main trends: teachers either volunteer in order to fill a void or address a need, or teachers are recruited by an administrator to fill a leadership role. The formality of the leadership role did not determine the formality of the pathway taken to move into the role. Conclusions include a descriptive framework for pathways taken to leadership and descriptions of specific supports provided by the MSSE program as identified by MSSE program graduates.

The first is to revise an instrument that assesses nurse-leadership competencies and perform a content validity of such instrument. Secondly, this study will psychometrically examine the instrument and see if the instrument shows validity through a factor analysis. Nursing leadership is paramount in the complex healthcare system that is in place today. Patients have higher acuity, and nurses require a greater knowledge base to care for such patients. Nurse leaders need competency-based education and training to care for higher-acuity patients. Research exists verifying that effective nursing leadership helps promote better patient outcomes, but there is not an instrument available, created by nurses for nurses, to assess the competencies needed to be an effective leader. A nurse-leadership-competency checklist for critical-care nurses was revised into an instrument that could be used by all nurses for leadership competency. Content validity assessment was performed on this revised instrument through a panel of three judges. All items scored an I-CVI of 1.00 concluding that this instrument had validity. Once content validity was completed, the instrument was put into a Likert Scale format and emailed to 128 registered nurses from two western states. Fifty registered nurses from these two western states responded to the survey. Respondents were required to rate the importance of each factor listed on the survey. These results were analyzed using SPSS version 22 through a factor analysis. The results indicate that the instrument is a reliable tool to assess nurse leadership. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.992. With a Cronbach's alpha being this high, the instrument can have item reduction and still produce good results. This instrument, with further revision and testing, could be instrumental for competency-based leadership skills for nurses.

I consider whether USDA's crop reports facilitate price consensus in the winter wheat futures market by testing the hypothesis that uncertainty, as measured by realized price volatility is reduced following the release of USDA reports. This hypothesis was originally developed in studies using implied volatility and found significant decreases. I instead calculate realized daily and intraday volatility using transaction level data from Kansas City Board of Trade futures contracts. Dates on which USDA reports are released are compared to the ten days around the report. Exploiting the full granularity of data, intraminute volatilities are computed to test whether there are distributional differences between report and non-report days. All results suggest that realized volatility does not decrease following USDA wheat report releases but instead increases. Regression analysis shows this result is robust to the inclusion of a limited but relevant set of controls.	['auxiliary sciences of history', 'civilization', 'economics', 'social sciences']

We propose several heuristic algorithms to address the problems of inference, structure learning, and parameter estimation in Bayesian networks. The proposed algorithms are based on Overlapping Swarm intelligence, a modification of particle swarm optimization in which a problem is broken into overlapping subproblems and a swarm is assigned to each subproblem. The algorithm maintains a global solution that is used for fitness evaluation, and is updated periodically through a competition mechanism. We describe how the problems of inference, structure learning, and parameter estimation can be broken into subproblems, and provide communication and competition mechanisms that allow swarms to share information about learned solutions. We also present a distributed alternative to Overlapping Swarm Intelligence that does not require a global network for fitness evaluation. For the problems of full and partial abductive inference, a swarm is assigned to each relevant node in the network. Each swarm learns the relevant state assignments associated with the Markov blanket for its corresponding node. In our approach to parameter estimation, a swarm is associated with each node in the network that corresponds to either a latent variable or a child of a latent variable. Each node's corresponding swarm learns the parameters associated with that node's Markov blanket. We also apply Overlapping Swarm Intelligence to several variations of the structure learning problem: learning Bayesian classifiers, learning Bayesian networks with complete data, and learning Bayesian networks with latent variables. For each problem, a swarm is associated with each node in the network. This work makes a number of contributions relating to the advancement of Overlapping Swarm Intelligence as a general optimization technique. We demonstrate the applicability of Overlapping Swarm Intelligence to both discrete and continuous optimization problems. We also examine the effect of the swarm architecture and degree of overlap on algorithm performance. The experiments presented here demonstrate that, while the sub-swarm architecture affects algorithm performance, Overlapping Swarm Intelligence continues to perform well even when there is little overlap between the swarms.

These ponds are currently not being utilized and are holding billions of gallons of water. The extracted water in these ponds is presently being discharged to local stream drainages or infiltrating into the surrounding soil. The environmental impacts of this increase in water can have negative effects on the surrounding areas. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibility of using CBM production ponds in the Powder River Basin, in Montana and Wyoming, for the growth of microalgae and the production of biodiesel from their accumulated lipids. Microalgae have been known to grow in other bodies of undesirable water and research has been ongoing on how to effectively use microalgae as a resource by stimulating lipid accumulation through the use of various environmental stressors. Coal bed methane ponds already provide a source of non-potable water for microalgae cultivation. Exploring the possibility of making these ponds a growth medium for microalgae is the first step in determining whether they can be turned into a productive energy resource. A native green alga, CBMW, has been isolated from a CBM production pond in northeastern Wyoming. CBMW has been cultured and grown under laboratory conditions in sterile CBM water and Bold's Basal Medium (BBM). Chlorophyll levels, biomass growth, pH, lipid accumulation, and water chemistry were tracked while CBMW was grown in sterile CBM water to understand how the alga responds to varying environmental conditions. When grown under the right environmental conditions isolate CBMW increased biomass and accumulated lipids. These results suggest that attempting to grow CBMW on a larger scale in CBM production water could be an effective method to produce biodiesel while utilizing a potentially problematic water source.

Factual and convincing representations are not necessarily congruent, and a film's merit of authenticity is often based on the perceived validity of the visual content represented. While visual imagery dominates a presentation's general delivery, a film's sound design is a fundamental structural element that is often overlooked or less scrutinized with regard to factual or accurate recounting of these same historical events. The purpose of this thesis is to examine methodologies of sound acquisition and reproduction and to discuss how various acoustic contents are perceived in relation to associated visual elements. While discerning viewers may notice critical discrepancies in picture contents that may invalidate a film's credibility, a complex matrix of sonic elements does not lend itself to deconstruction as easily. Thorough analysis of a science and natural history film must include an examination of its complete sound design. Consideration must be given to the ethical implications of using any synthesized or borrowed audio tracks if such a work is to be considered as ""factual"" documentary. The standards of acceptance or rejection should be no different than those associated with fabricating unnatural or contrived visual contents, no matter how compelling may be the end product."

The excellent efficiencies of solid oxide fuel cells as solid state electrochemical devices arise mainly from the direct conversion of chemical to electrical energy--through oxygen reduction at the cathode, oxide diffusion through the electrolyte, and fuel oxidation at the anode. Some of these processes possess high activation energies, requiring high operational temperatures (generally > 650 Â°C). These conditions can hasten deleterious carbon accumulation and anode deterioration. These high operating temperatures also pose significant challenges in directly observing chemical reactions responsible for electrochemical oxidation and materials degradation. Yet, these observations are needed to understand fundamental mechanisms responsible for these processes--an understanding necessary to improve the performance, durability and versatility of SOFCs, especially as these devices are required to operate with complex fuels and fuel mixtures. In this work, solid oxide fuel cells constructed with traditional Ni/yttrium stabilized zirconia ceramic-metallic (or cermet) anodes are studied in operando and in situ with several novel optical techniques (Raman vibrational spectroscopy, near infrared thermal imaging and fourier-transform infrared emission spectroscopy) and electrochemical measurements that provide vital insights into mechanisms surrounding bio-related fuel electrochemistry. The first study demonstrated that Ni oxidation is slower than reduction at the anode. The second study quantified electrochemically accessible anode carbon accumulation under methane fuel, while detailing deleterious mechanisms and microstructural changes that accompany cell polarization in the absence of gas phase fuels. The third study explored the kinetics of carbon removal from Ni-based anodes by CO 2, H 2O, and O 2 and detailed mechanistically why they may be different. The fourth study revealed mechanisms associated with carbon formation and current generation from biogas and methane as a function of operational condition. Collectively, these studies have begun to provide the direct, molecularly specific information necessary to empirically evaluate mechanistic descriptions of biorelated fuel electrochemistry and anode degradation.

The entry of these metals into cells require controlled processes, including their reduction prior to uptake. A group of integral membrane enzymes, the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (Steap) family, are able to perform this function. Steap3, in particular, functions as the primary ferric reductase in the transferrin cycle, the dominant mode of erythrocyte iron uptake. How these enzymes perform these functions has remained ill-defined. Here, the biochemical underpinnings of Steap metalloreductase activity have been investigated. To elucidate these mechanisms, expression systems for Steap3 and Steap4 have been developed in bacterial, insect, and human cell lines and purified to varying degrees. By analyzing the truncated cytoplasmic oxidoreductase domain of Steap4, it was found that NADPH is oxidized by transferring a pair of electrons to a flavin. With this truncation, however, flavin only binds weakly and the construct shows no ability to preferentially bind one type of flavin. In contrast, when the full length Steap3 was partially purified, it exhibits high-affinity FAD-binding, indicating that the transmembrane region of the protein contains the major structural features of the FAD binding site. Further, it was found that the cytoplasm-oriented loops between transmembrane helices formed the site. The next cofactor in the electron transport chain is a single b-type heme. Two strictly conserved histidines were identified that coordinate the heme and both are required for heme incorporation. The metal binding site at the extracellular face of the membrane was also characterized. Here, it was found that Steap3 and Steap4 share a conserved high-affinity iron binding site. Additionally, iron and copper both bind with similar affinities to Steap4. Two critical residues of the metal binding site were determined and their predicted proximity to the heme cofactor suggests that the electron is transfer is direct between cofactor and metal. Finally, it was found that Steap's are able to dimerize in the cells, forming homo- and heterodimers Together, the enzymatic mechanism has been characterized in-depth for the first time for these physiologically-significant enzymes.

68934	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10142	The geochemical evolution of the Cerro Uturuncu magma chamber, sw Bolivia and its relation to the Andean Central Volcanic Zone	Cerro Uturuncu is a composite volcano located in the back-arc of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (22.27Â°S, 67.18Â°W). The volcano has exclusively erupted crystal-rich andesite and dacite lava flows over the ~800,000 year life span of eruptive activity. This study provides new bulk-rock major- and trace- element, 18 O/16 O isotope ratios, Sr, Nd, and Pb radiogenic isotopic ratios of lava flows, domes, magmatic inclusions and xenoliths. The study also adds major and trace element and Sr isotopic ratios of plagioclase phenocrysts in order to examine the evolution of the magmatic plumbing system beneath Cerro Uturuncu and place the volcanic center in the regional context of the CVZ. Plagioclase crystals from silicic (andesitic to dacitic) lavas and domes at Volcan Uturuncu exhibit large variations in An contents, textures, and core to rim 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios. Many of the isotopic variations cannot have existed at magmatic temperatures for more than a few thousand years. The crystals likely derived from different locations in the crustal magmatic system and mixed just prior to eruption. Uturuncu magmas initially assimilated crustal rocks with high 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios. The magmas were subsequently modified by frequent recharge of more mafic magmas with lower 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios. A typical Uturuncu silicic magma therefore only attains its final composition just prior to or during eruption. On an arc-wide scale silicic lavas erupted from three well-characterized composite volcanoes between 21Â°S and 22Â°S (Aucanquilcha, Ollague, and Uturuncu) display systematically higher K 2O, LILE, REE and HFSE contents and 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios with increasing distance from the arc-front. In contrast, the lavas have systematically lower Al 2O 3, Na 2O, Sr, and Ba contents; LILE/HFSE ratios; 143 Nd/144 Nd ratios; and more negative Eu anomalies. Silicic magmas along the arc-front apparently reflect melting of relatively young, mafic composition amphibolitic source rocks with the continental crust becoming increasingly older with a more felsic bulk composition toward the east. This results from progressively smaller degrees of mantle partial melting, primary melt generation, and crustal hybridization with distance from the arc-front.

As detailed by the work presented herein, viral capsids are not simply a static container for the viral genome. Rather, they are highly functional molecular machines critical to the virus life cycle. The assembly process of the HBV capsid involves the concerted assembly of 120 homodimeric subunits to form a T=4 icosahedron, which has been shown to be affected by temperature, ionic strength, and small molecules in a manner consistent with models of allosteric regulation. Our lab has already completed rigorous measurements of the conformational equilibria for HBV protein using enzyme-mediated kinetic hydrolysis, where we investigated the role of potential molecular switches in capsid assembly. These studies have now been complemented with hydrogen deuterium exchange based mass spectrometry. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) provides valuable insight into solution-phase protein conformation and structure. The resolution of protein structural information in HDX-MS measurements is primarily limited by the peptide coverage of the on-line pepsin proteolysis. We have realized near single amino acid resolution coverage maps by combining online proteolysis with rapid reverse-phase chromatography of highly rich peptide mixtures. Through the use of differential HDX, I investigated the effect of temperature, salt and amino acid mutation on rate of uptake and protection. These effectors have proven to thermodynamically or/and kinetically target the capsid assembly. High resolution HDX-MS was used to investigate the effect of these effectors on the protein dynamics. This has allowed us to elucidate the allosteric mechanism involved in the capsid assembly. Together these results indicate that the conformational landscape of HBV can be remodeled by a range of factors. The ability to map protein motions by HDX on specifically selected conformational states has profound implications in revealing quasi-equivalent subunit associations and the design of antiviral therapies.

As such, it is critical to assess the potential roles of intraspecific variation in systematic interpretations. Ontogenetic (developmental) change has been found to be a potential contributor to taxonomic confusion in the fossil record of dinosaurs. Similarly, variation between specimens found at different stratigraphic levels should be assessed in order to decipher variation within and between closely related taxa. The chasmosaurine ceratopsid Triceratops has had a complicated taxonomic history due to variation in cranial morphology between specimens. Recent work in the uppermost Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation (HCF) has produced a large (n>50) new sample of specimens. Using this data set its possible to reassess variation in Triceratops and further explore chasmosaurine paleobiology. Building on previous work on Triceratops ontogeny, examination of the parietal-squamosal frill finds that these bones underwent a dramatic transformation late in ontogeny. The short, solid frill of Triceratops expanded into a more elongate, thin, fenestrated condition, which had previously been found to characterize the coeval ceratopsid taxon Torosaurus latus. This suggests that these taxa are synonymous with Torosaurus representing the mature form of Triceratops rather than a distinct taxon. Further, Nedoceratops hatcheri, which is represented by a single specimen with a small fenestra in the parietal, is hypothesized to represent a transitional morphology between unfenestrated and fully fenestrated (Torosaurus) specimens. Detailed locality information for specimens collected over the course of the Hell Creek Project permits for the placement of specimens in stratigraphic context. The two currently recognized species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, are stratigraphically separated within the HCF and cladistic and stratocladistic analyses are consistent with the evolution of Triceratops incorporating anagenetic (transformational) change. Morphometric analyses of the extant archosaur Ceratogymna atrata (the Black-casqued hornbill) indicate that enlarged cranial structures function as objects of visual display. Morphometric studies of Triceratops further suggest that specimens found lower in the formation may have attained the Torosaurus frill morphology through ontogeny, whereas this basal condition became increasingly rare higher in the formation. Morphometric results are also consistent with early divergence between two distinct genera.	['life sciences', 'biology', 'morphology', 'anatomy, comparative', 'natural history', 'zoology', 'science']
68937	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/10146	The application of mass spectrometry-based 'omics technologies to investigate environmental interactions of microbial systems	Microorganisms interact with their surroundings and each other. However, these interactions are complex and difficult to understand. This research presents the utilization of simplified environmental microbial systems from the extremes of life to gain insight into the roles of microbes in diverse processes including biogeochemical cycling and viral infection. The complex mixture of organic compounds within aquatic systems, known as dissolved organic matter (DOM), is an integral component of the global carbon cycle. It is a carbon source for microbial activity and impacts biogeochemical and ecological processes. However, little is known about the release and bioconversion of these compounds. This thesis presents a liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LCMS) based exometabolomics approach to chemically characterize the interaction between DOM and the representative microbial species that transform it. This work illustrates for the first time the ability to measure the relative abundance of molecular constituents of DOM during heterotrophic bacterial processing. Processing was shown to be dynamic over time, even with only single organism interactions. A LCMS based proxy was established to predict the lability of DOM carbon sources, and the labile nature of the source was shown to be a significant factor in DOM processing by single organisms. Further, the temporal interaction of two ecologically relevant beta-Proteobacteria with DOM from the Cotton Glacier, Antarctica highlight the importance of understanding the diversity of single organism DOM interactions to interpret community level bacterial interactions. LCMS-based 'omics techniques can also be utilized to characterize the changes in protein expression associated with viral infection of hyperthermophilic archaea. Viral-host interactions in Sulfolobus archaeal systems are poorly understood, and exhibit a diversity of regulation patterns. LCMS-based shotgun proteomics was utilized to characterize the temporal response of Sulfolobus islandicus to infection by Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus (SIRV2). The strengths and weaknesses of label-free protein quantitation techniques were assessed, enabling the detection of the regulation of SIRV2 proteins over time and identification of key host responses to infection. Together these studies show the impact of LCMS based 'omics technologies in bringing new insights into environmental microbial interactions.

This involved taking a comprehensive look at the widely accepted physiographic variables of: elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and wind exposure, but also avalanche activity, which has been given limited explicit inclusion. The paired basin comparison adopted in this study, between a hypothesized avalanche prone basin and avalanche free basin, has been previously used to correlate avalanche activity with snowmelt runoff. However, it has not been used in an attempt to parse out which variables have the dominant influence on SWE distribution between adjacent areas of very similar physiographic character. While most previous studies have focused on the period of peak SWE to study this distribution, this current research looked at the evolution of the controlling variables throughout snowpack development. A robust dataset of snow depth and SWE measurements were collected during a January 31 - July 10, 2013 field campaign on Cedar Mountain near Big Sky, MT. Physiographic variable values were extracted from a 10 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) at snow sample points and input as predictors of observed SWE in multiple linear regression (MLR) and binary regression tree (BRT) models to estimate SWE across the study area. Optimal models were selected by various measures of goodness of fit and cross-validation criteria. Calculated R 2 values for MLR models (0.17-0.57) and BRT models (0.33-0.66) were comparable to previous studies indicating a relative level of success in predictive performance. Subsequent analysis of each optimal model's variable selection and predicted SWE distributions revealed differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of this metric between the paired basins, confirming some well-understood processes as well as offering new insights.

I contend that these claims on objectivity are false, and that other modes, specifically the self-portrait essay, can more authentically communicate scientific principles. This paper examines case studies of science-related self-portrait films that foreground subjectivity and reflexivity to varying degrees, and analyzes their effectiveness. I argue that the self-portrait essay film and its rejection of objectivity is a compelling alternative to conventional science documentary.

The apparent lack of features that radically change through ontogeny has even led some to speculate that sauropods exhibited isometric growth. Yet within the past decade a small number of morphologic features have been demonstrated to undergo significant morphologic change; thus maturity can be tracked in ways other than histologic analysis (bone microstructure). The recognition of features that change dramatically through ontogeny hints at significant phylogenetic and biomechanical consequences in the immature sauropod condition. However the topic of morphologic ontogenetic change in sauropods is highly debated, with some question as to the validity of these apparent patterns. The current study will attempt to recognize additional morphologic and histologic features that can be used to infer maturity in diplodocid sauropods. By examining a broad range of features that span every aspect of the skeleton, the goal of this analysis is to substantiate previous ontogenetic inferences and conclusions. The findings of this analysis indicate that contrary to previous notions, diplodocid sauropods underwent radical ontogenetic changes in several skeletal elements. This analysis also establishes a suite of morphologic and histologic attributes that in combination can be used as a guide to identify maturational status in other diplodocid specimens. In addition this study also raises question to the validity of small bodied sauropod specimens that were previously recognized as distinct species.

A series of multivalent PAMAM dendrimers were functionalized with lactose and applied to the study and mediation of multivalent galectin-1 interactions. An ELISA was designed to study the interaction of galectin-1 with surface immobilized glycodendrimers. The results of the ELISAs indicate that galectin-1 binds well to the multivalent framework. DLS and fluorescence microscopy were used to study that interaction of galectin-1 with glycodendrimers in solution. These solution-based assays indicate that the glycodendrimers nucleate galectin-1 into nanoparticles. The ability of the glycodendrimers to organize the galectin-1 into biologically active arrays was investigated in cellular assays. A homotypic cellular aggregation assay using DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells, which express a putative galectin-1 ligand (Mucin1), was designed to study the influence of multivalent glycodendrimers on cellular aggregation/tumor formation. All generations of glycodendrimers were observed to inhibit cellular aggregation by diverting the galectin-1 from its native role in cellular cross-linking of cancer cells. To further probe multivalent interactions in cancer, the glycodendrimers were applied to a tube formation assay to study galectin-1 angiogenic processes. Galectin-1 was observed to accelerate neovascularization, and the impact of the galectin-1 was mildly inhibited by the glycodendrimers.

(WMSM) scale (Mindset Works, 2008- 2012c). Blackwell (2012) asserted that the concept of a growth school mindset culture was operationalized in the WMSM scale using five key features. However, the reliability and validity of this instrument had not been fully explored (S. Rodriguez, personal communication, March 31, 2015). This was the first empirical study that attempted to validate the underlying constructs the WMSM scale is purported to assess by Mindset Works, Inc (Blackwell, 2015). No research was found that had explored the factor structure of the WMSM scale. Without empirical research supporting the factor structure of this instrument its use in interpreting the measurement of school culture may be confounded (Hopko, 2003; Netemeyer, Bearden & Sharma, 2003). Results of the Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed a four-factor structure. In addition, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to further verify the fit of the four-factor model. The four-factor model produced a root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) of .063. The 90% confidence interval (.049 - .076) surrounding the RMSEA result indicates that the proposed four-factor model identified by the EFA was a 'fair' fit to the estimated population model (Browne & Cudek, 1993; MacCallum, Browne & Sugawara, 1996). The accuracy of this fit to the population model was strengthened by a CFI of .96 and a NNFI of .95 (Kim, 2005). The results of this study added to the body of mindset research and are useful for school leaders and researchers who seek to use the WMSM scale to measure growth mindset within a school's culture (e.g. Hoy, Tarter & Kottkamp, 1991; Kearney, 2007; Murphy & Dweck, 2010; Farrington, Roderick, Allensworth, Nagaoka, Seneca-Keyes, Johnson & Beechum, 2012; Delaney, Dweck, Murphy, Chatman & Kray, 2015; Walton, 2014).

Classically, the implementation of biotin labeling, known as the biotin switch technique (BST), with streptavidin-agarose bead pulldown and subsequent immunoblotting, has offered the best results for identifying S-nitrosocysteine residues within proteins. However, this technique has come under scrutiny for its use of ascorbate as a reducing agent. Numerous published accounts have shown ascorbate's poor reducing potential especially for S-nitrosoproteins. To this end, the Grieco lab has shown that pure S-nitrosylated proteins can be transformed into S-phenylsulfonylcysteine residues, which can be readily converted into mixed disulfides thus allowing for labeling of pure nitrosylated proteins at pH's as low as pH 4. This protocol is referred to as the thiosulfonate switch technique (TST). The Grieco lab has also modified the biotin switch technique to incorporate electrophilic maleimide and orthopyridyl disulfide (OPSS) dyes for fluorescence labeling of the S-nitroso proteome. To examine the scope and limitations of the TST vis-a-vis cell lysates, the TST protocol and the modified BST protocol, both employing novel Z-CyDyes developed in the Grieco Laboratory, have been used to specifically label S-nitrosylated proteins in complex liver lysates. The successful labeling of mouse liver lysates, employing UV and ascorbate SNO knockout negative controls, is demonstrated in both 1D and 2D gel studies. Also reported herein is the creation of novel second generation maleimide dyes (SO3-Cy-Mal) based on Z-CyDyes.

Students typically understand the premise of games and how games are played. Gamification requires that students master a specific level or learning objective before continuing on in the course. Although gamification is a relatively new model of instruction, it incorporates elements of standards based grading and mastery learning. The purpose of this study was to determine if gamification increased student achievement, student mastery and student motivation. Learning objectives were separated and all class activities centered on leveled learning objectives. Students were not able to test out of a set of learning goals until they had demonstrated mastery of the content. Student test and quiz scores were recorded over a 27-week period. Students took surveys, participated in interviews and discussions as part of the study as well. Results showed there was a significant increase in scores with implementation of gamification. Particular success was shown in non-honors classes rather than honors courses. Student mastery and achievement increased with implementation because students were not allowed to move forward in content if they did not receive at least an 80% on quiz scores. I will continue to adjust and modify this learning model based on the positive outcomes of the study.

The literature indicates that scratch cooking with whole, fresh foods can help school nutrition programs meet USDA meal standards while creating healthier, more appealing meals for students. However, limited peer reviewed information exists regarding the best training approaches to provide school nutrition professionals with the necessary skills to integrate scratch cooking. To inform the development of the class, 103 Montana school food service managers and head cooks were surveyed and 12 key informants were interviewed. This formative research identified key skills and approaches necessary to integrate whole, fresh foods in school nutrition programs and specific areas to target with training. From this research, the Montana Cook Fresh Workshop was developed to address four main culinary concepts: knife skills, mise en place, use of herbs and spices, and appropriate equipment. Outcomes of the workshop were evaluated based on participant satisfaction and changes in participants' whole, fresh foods (a) cooking knowledge, (b) confidence, (c) attitude, and (d) intention to use. Participant satisfaction was evaluated with a Likert scale questionnaire and series of open-ended questions. Researchers used a pre-test/post-test design to assess participants' knowledge, confidence, attitudes, and intentions regarding whole, fresh food. For each statement assessing participant satisfaction, 96-100 percent of participants selected 'agree' or 'strongly agree,' indicating high levels of participant satisfaction. From pre to post test, participants' knowledge, confidence, and intentions to use whole, fresh food increased significantly. Attitude did not change significantly. The success and appeal of the Montana Cook Fresh Workshop supports the use of hands-on classes to address training needs of school food service professionals and overcome barriers to using whole, fresh food. With the ability to use more whole foods, K-12 school food service programs have the opportunity to offer more appealing meals that meet USDA guidelines and promote healthy food choices.

As production in the Bakken grows, wells are one-third of their produced gas, valued at roughly $1 billion per year. Using a well-level panel of monthly production, I explore potential determinants of flaring and provide insight into the decision to produce oil from wells that are not connected to the gas gathering system. Through initial linear regressions, I show that North Dakota Bakken wells are twice as much, on average, than Montana Bakken wells. Further, I find that unconnected wells are nearly four times as much as connected wells. I model the decision to connect wells through duration analysis to show that connection timing varies between operators of different sizes and that the threat of flaring penalties increases the hazard rate of connection. Lastly, I exploit variation between field oil production rules in North Dakota to find that the rate of rule compliance varies both by rule stringency and the size of the operator.

The 2005 Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) survey elicited data from Montana PHNs regarding their concern for environmental hazards and health effects. Using data from the EPHT survey, the aim of this thesis was to determine if differences existed among Montana PHNs regarding their concern for environmentally attributable hazards and health effects based on their level of educational preparation. Findings indicated there were no statistically significant differences between PHNs with a baccalaureate degree or higher versus PHNs with less than a baccalaureate degree and their concern for either environmental hazards or health effects. Qualitative differences were also examined and indicated that PHNs in the total sample were most concerned about tobacco smoke in the homes of children and cancer. Conversely, they were least concerned about residences built in floodplains and infertility. These findings are discussed as they apply to PHN practice and preparation of nurses to intervene where environmental concerns exist.

68949	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1032	Characterization of the Arabidopsis compact inflorescence 3 (cif3) mutant and identification of the cif3 gene product as a chloroplast localized putative ATPase	A new mutant of Arabidopsis, that exhibits very short inflorescence internodes in contrast to the wild-type raceme structure, was isolated from an Agrobacterium tumifaciens T-DNA insertion screen. This plant closely resembles the previously described compact inflorescence (cif1) mutant (Goosey and Sharrock, 2001). The cif1 trait was shown to require altered alleles of two genes; a recessive mutation at the cif1 gene and a naturally occurring unlinked dominant allele, CIF2. Although the phenotypes of cif1 and the new mutant are similar, complementation tests show that they are different genes, and the new mutant is designated cif3. The cif3 mutation is recessive and, unlike the cif1 mutation, does not require the presence of a dominant allele of the CIF2 gene to cause the inflorescence phenotype. Moreover, the cif1 phenotype was previously shown to be restricted to the adult vegetative phase of growth and to strongly influence the morphology of adult rosette leaves. In contrast, cif3 does not show an effect on adult leaves and therefore does not show apparent phase-specific expression. The cif3 mutation is tagged with a T-DNA insertion and the CIF3 gene has been cloned using forward genetics. Northern blot analysis shows expression of a disrupted transcript from the CIF3 gene in the cif3 mutant. A transgenic complementation test was performed and confirms the identity of the CIF3 gene. The CIF3 gene product has been shown to be a chloroplast localized putative ATPase. These studies provide insight into the genetic mechanisms controlling inflorescence development in Arabidopsis and may provide a foundation for understanding inflorescence architecture in agriculturally important crop plants.

Object-oriented classifications of a high-resolution Quickbird image and a fused Quickbird and LiDAR image were compared. Results demonstrated that object-oriented classification can be used to overcome the difficulty associated with pixel-based classification of high-resolution images through the addition of contextual metrics to the classification process. The fused classification resulted in decreased errors of commission and omission for each class, but the differences between the classifications were not statistically significant. The fused classification represented the shapes of land cover objects more precisely based on visual assessment. Temporal analysis of land cover patterns was accomplished successfully by using a generalized version of the fused classification to map historical development. Previous research on multitemporal mapping of multiresolution images has been lacking. Our research showed that the generalization of a high-resolution classification can be used as training data for a historical image. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image differencing and boosted classification trees were used to identify and classify areas of change. This resulted in the successful identification of temporal changes in land cover due to Mountain Resort Development (MRD). Statistical pattern analysis revealed correlations between MRD and the variables distance-to-streams, distance-to-roads, slope, and aspect. Forest changes were found to be disproportionately located farther away from streams and on lower slopes. Grassland changes disproportionately occurred closer to steams, but overall grassland change was proportional to grassland land cover in 1990. Classification tree analysis indicated the variables distance-to-streams, distance-to-roads, slope, and aspect explained 87% of the variance for the change classes and might be related to amenity development. There was an increase in impervious surfaces and a decrease in both forests and grassland areas between the years 1990-2005. Loss of forest and grassland area can result in increased habitat fragmentation and can have negative consequences for ecosystems within the areas. Overall, this project successfully mapped both current and historical development patterns in Big Sky, Montana. This allowed for statistical pattern analysis of variables that have been shown to be correlated with MRD.

68952	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1038	A comparison of learning : integration of a virtual and traditional field trip into an introductory environmental geology course	Field trips are a common component of geoscience courses. However, time and budget constraints, increased safety considerations and large class size have become common obstacles to teaching in the field. Technology has provided an attractive alternative through the virtual field trip. While there is a wealth of virtual field trips available on the internet, it is unclear how students learn on a virtual field trip and how those trips are best incorporated in Earth Science curriculum. The goals of this study are to establish the learning goals addressed by virtual field trips, determine if virtual field trips are best used as a pre- or post-activity in conjunction with a traditional field trip and provide suggestions for developing effective virtual field trips. A groundwater hydrology and policy virtual field trip was developed and compared to a traditional field-based counterpart. The field trip was designed to help students gain an understanding of groundwater flow and aquifer properties, understand how geology influences the groundwater availability, learn how to use and evaluate data, develop question-asking and hypothesis-testing skills, develop observational and spatial reasoning skills, and gain an appreciation for the complexity of science and its application to real-world problems. A modified pre-test/post-test and attitude study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of virtual field trips, gain insight into how they are best used in an introductory Earth Science course and explore students' attitude toward virtual field trips. Students' performance, confidence, knowledge and attitude were evaluated prior to and following, the virtual and traditional field trips. The virtual field trip did not successfully mimic teaching observation and data evaluation learning goals; however it was able to address question and hypothesis posing skills and establish an appreciation for the complexity of a scientific issue. The virtual field trip in this study was best used as a preactivity, it helped reduce novelty space and establish necessary content knowledge prior to going to the field. However, using the virtual field trip as a pre-activity may diminish studentsÎ± sense of discovery and wonder about the natural world.

Moreover, research in the eating disorders literature shows a negative relationship between self-esteem and eating. As such, the present experiment was designed to merge these two lines of research to examine what causal role, if any, self-esteem plays in men's and women's food consumption. It was proposed that some individuals should show a lack of self regulation in terms of the type and amount of food eaten following ostracism. It was also predicted that this effect would have some possible moderators. To test this prediction, participants were randomly assigned to either an ostracism or inclusion condition within the computer game Cyberball. Results indicated that the ostracism manipulation did not result in the anticipated decrease in SE status nor did it cause any significant changes in eating behavior. Nevertheless, significant correlations between SE and body dissatisfaction (BD) were observed, as well as between BD and appearance based rejection sensitivity. There were also significant correlations between body mass index (BMI) and BD, as well as between SE and ARS in both genders. There was also a significant correlation between SE and BMI, but only for male participants. Exploratory analyses revealed that there may have been an unforeseen impact of experimenter gender on eating behavior post ostracism such that self presentation may have impacted the manner in which individuals responded to ostracism.

Often the victims of abuse and exploitation, the positive attributes of collectively organizing were attractive to women. While many working-women found union membership alluring, few held positions of power within unions and many were denied entrance to unions altogether. In Butte, Montana, however it was a different story. Butte was a union town to the very core. Almost everyone who worked in Butte was a union member in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Although initially denied entrance into male trade unions, women took it upon themselves to organize their own womenÎ±s union for white and black women workers in Silver Bow County in 1890. The WomenÎ±s Protective Union founded and run by women, allowed for an organization that was exclusively gender segregated. Women were organizers, business agents, and delegates to the local Silver Bow Trades and Labor Council and MontanaÎ±s State Federation of Labor. The unique attributes of the all womenÎ±s union extend beyond its composition and leadership. By analyzing the WPU in the context of ButteÎ±s labor community, this study attempts to illustrate the activism of the union women. The womenÎ±s union used direct action methods to achieve change for its membership. Through boycotts and strikes, the WPU demonstrated its willingness to participate in the local labor movement. Its activism and membership in the Silver Bow Trades and Labor Council further illustrates the womenÎ±s commitment to the labor community. This study focuses on the early activities of the WomenÎ±s Protective Union and its navigation in the local and state labor movement. It highlights the activities of the womenÎ±s union between the years 1890-1929, including the womenÎ±s efforts to fight amalgamation with the male culinary union and the month long strike for higher wages in 1920.

I look at masculinity and how O'Brian may be demonstrating something interesting about the similarities and the differences between a nineteenth century masculinity a more modern concept of masculinity through the fictional characters in his Master and Commander Series. In order to evaluate his representation of the nineteenth century man I look at representations from the period by authors including Frederick Marryat and Jane Austen. The connection between Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian is clearly outlined by many theorists as O'Brian was an ardent fan of Austen and, arguably, emulated her works. Marryat and Austen serve as a control group to give accurate representations of concepts of masculinity from the early nineteenth century against which to place O'Brian's characters and make some interesting comments about the comparison. More than simply comparing period authors to a modern author writing about the period, I focus on the difference between the two primary characters in O'Brian's novels. I argue that Jack Aubrey demonstrates a Consummate Masculinity of the early nineteenth century while Stephen Maturin, though not conforming to the type of masculinity demonstrated by Jack, is still masculine. From Stephen's difference we can see ways in which O'Brian reveals how masculinity has moved beyond the possibility of a Consummate Masculinity to a broader, more modern, concept of what it means to be a man.

It also addresses the cultural, social and religious obstacles that girls, women and teachers face, while identifying appropriate recommendations for girls, women and teachers to improve their level of, and access to, educational opportunities. The methodology and data collection included formal and informal interviews, surveys and field notes gathered over a two-year period. The results of this study are shared in a narrative analysis of the experiences of teachers, young women and girls in the Seri Valley School community. Barriers to female education have great consequences for family and community health, potential home and community income, and the following generation's educational opportunities. As this study shows, even when girls are allowed to attend primary school, there are still many barriers that keep them from continuing on to higher education. Those barriers are: a shortage of well-educated female teachers, a supportive community that is open to girls continuing their education, and the significantly important approval of the influential male in the family allowing the girl or woman to continue her education. A result of these barriers is that female students in rural, isolated regions of Pakistan rarely go on to middle or high school for their education, therefore not improving the level of education for the population of female teachers and the future generation of girls. Breaking this cycle of depriving girls an education equal to boys needs to start with the community supporting access to schools, educating families about the benefits and importance of educating the female population, and providing opportunities for female teachers to continue their education and professional development.

In the middle school setting, the math concepts that are needed to conduct many science labs are a challenge for students to complete, or students find it difficult to make connections through the problem solving component in a science activity. This study was implemented with a sixth grade class that has math and science as a block of time with the same teacher, (math 50 minutes and then science 50 minutes), and none of the students had individual education plans. The major focus of this study wanted to determine if using an integration of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) principles develops a deeper understanding of scaling and proportional reasoning by using interactive computer and online simulations (three lessons online for part of a unit called ""Scale City""). This study also wanted to determine whether students would gain self confidence in both solving math problems as well as being more comfortable using simulations. Student attitude and confidence surveys were given pre and post treatment. At the beginning and end of each of the lessons, students completed a pre-and post-assessment. During days of the lesson where students used the interactive computer or online simulations, a brief end-of-the class feedback/reflection form was used to analyze possible fluctuations in confidence level using simulations and interactives as well as problem solving confidence levels. Data was triangulated and analyzed to determine results."

A number of activities were used within a physics topic over a period of ten weeks. The activities included reading techniques, discussion strategies and vocabulary activities. Results showed that after using these strategies, students' use of scientific vocabulary increased in both their oral and written work, their comprehension and use of the textbook improved and their test results reflected this positive improvement. When given the opportunity and time, students' literacy skills will improve if given the right tools for them to master and use in class.

I define three categories of nature film which reflect varying degrees of human-animal interaction, anthropomorphism and aesthetics: the testimonial, explanatory and non-verbal styles. Although each one is limited in its ability to represent wildlife accurately, it is important to realize that they all show animals from different perspectives (from most to least human-centered, respectively). Given that the majority of people today gain most of their knowledge about wildlife from natural history programs, it is critical for viewers and filmmakers to understand the impact of these films on society--as both emotional and intellectual conduits into the natural world.

If yields are necessarily low, an insured producer may receive an indemnity payment. Currently, crop insurance is based on each individual's yield. If the individual's yield falls below a specified level, the individual will receive an indemnity. An alternative crop insurance program bases indemnities on . an area yield. If the yield of the predetermined area falls below a specific level, all insured producers will receive an indemnity. This thesis examines the yield variability reduction received by purchasing various forms of area yield and individual yield crop insurance and the actuarially fair premium costs associated with them. When a producer purchases insurance two decisions are made. First, the producer selects a trigger level which determines the critical yield which generates an indemnity payment. Second, the producer may be able to select a coverage level which is the amount of acreage covered by the contract. Each contract examined allows different levels for the trigger and coverage levels. The variance reduction provided from each contract is the variance of the yield without insurance less the variance of the yield with an insurance contract. The results indicate most producers receive some variance reduction from the area yield contracts. And, producers who have yields which are closely correlated with the area yield receive more variance reduction from the area yield insurance than from the individual yield insurance contracts. However, the area yield contracts which provide on average more yield variance reduction than the individual yield contracts, also have much higher actuarially fair premium costs. The area yield insurance contracts should be considered as an alternative to individual yield insurance, but the premium costs must be evaluated also.

This environmental isolate was obtained from an outbreak in Gideon, MO, and was classified as Salmonella enterica serotype Missouri. Gene expression profiles obtained from this environmental isolate were compared with profiles of the ATCC type strain Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium LT2 grown under the same conditions. It was shown that there were distinct transcriptional differences in both of the strains between the biofilm and planktonic phenotypes. Both strains exhibited the strong up-regulation of several gene pathways that were unique to the biofilm phenotype. These included genes responsible for the cobalamin-dependent anaerobic utilization of 1,2-propanediol (cob-cbi-pdu), type III secretion system apparatus and effector proteins located on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI-2) and the well characterized csg operon largely responsible for biofilm formation in Salmonella. A significant proportion of the genes present on the virulence plasmid PSLT were shown to be exclusively up-regulated in the biofilm phenotype of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2, illustrating the tendency of this pathogen to exhibit a promiscuous lifestyle whilst in the non-host environment. It was further demonstrated that the environmental isolate exhibited a more tenacious biofilm-forming tendency and overall greater survivability than the type strain in a low nutrient, non-host environment. It appeared from the transcriptional profile of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 during planktonic growth that the organism struggled to adapt and survive under low nutrient conditions as evidenced by the increased expression of ribosomal subunit operons rps and rpl and several stress-related genes including dnaK and htp. The conclusion may be drawn that Salmonella Missouri has developed several key systems differentiating the biofilm and planktonic phenotypes and affording it a competitive advantage. While some of these traits have previously been studied exclusively in the context of host pathogenicity, this research indicates that perhaps these so-called virulence strategies may afford the pathogen enhanced survival in non-host environments as well. Therefore, these findings suggest that the use of excessively sub-cultured laboratory strains may be inappropriate surrogates for studying the behavior of real-world pathogens.

Audio capabilities were not well utilized by students but students appreciated the instructor audio comments and feedback. Student comments on VoiceThread enabled the instructor to have a clearer understanding of student learning and misconceptions, which was then used to plan interventions and modifications in learning strategies.

68966	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1092	The impact of infusing science poetry into the biology curriculum	As concrete as science is, it is a subject matter that is often difficult to understand because of the multifaceted concepts and technical vocabulary that is deeply rooted in the essence of the subject matter. Frequently, advanced science is studied in a closed environment where access to experiences is limited. This lack of accessibility forces a need for a more tangible means to help learners develop and anchor theoretical constructs. The use of poetry in the science classroom may be one such way to inform, engage and enhance students' understanding of abstract and complex scientific concepts. The descriptive techniques that are shared by science and poetry allow for creative, critical, and metaphoric thinking. Public high school honors biology students from Morristown High School were enrolled as participants in this study. This study was two-fold; Part I focused on determining the impact of infusing science poetry into the biology curriculum. Results were analyzed using a Two-Tailed Independent t-Test at alpha=.05. Part II focused on the use of scientific poetic response as a summative assessment method to replace the traditional essay assessment. Results were assessed using a study-specific rubric and a Two-tailed Dependent t-Test for Paired Samples that compared each student's mean essay scores to their mean poetry scores at alpha=.05. Also, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) was utilized to establish any relationship between essays and poetic response assessments. This research demonstrated that there are some intersections and interactions across science and poetry that may assist students in comprehension of difficult abstract scientific material. Science poetry appears to be a tangible means to help learners develop and anchor theoretical constructs. The use of poetry in the biology classroom can inform, engage and enhance some students' understanding of abstract/complex scientific theories, concepts, and technical vocabulary. Offering learners an opportunity to reveal their understanding of complex biological concepts through scientific poetic response may just in fact be the much-needed scientific conceptual metacognitive summative assessment that many students and teachers have come to need. It is recommended that future research be conducted with a larger and more diverse population to further confirm affirmation of this study.

In this investigation strategies were implemented with the purpose of improving student engagement and learning in the biology classroom. I investigated whether or not a student-led demonstration versus a teacher-led demonstration had an impact on the retention rate of AP biology students. A progressive Bloom's Taxonomy technique was used in accordance with a student-led demonstration. I believe that because of the student-led demonstrations and a progressive Bloom's Taxonomy technique, students reached a higher level of Bloom's Taxonomy, became self-sustained critical thinkers, and in turn supported their own higher level thinking. This led to an understanding of a topic and long term memory recognition. The participating student had a positive affect on him/herself, the teacher and also my colleagues.

Although research on grandparent caregivers is increasing, there remains little research that addresses the challenges and issues facing grandparents raising grandchildren in rural locales. To address this shortcoming, this study examines the parental stressors experienced by rural grandparent caregivers and explores individual, parental, and community level factors that may be related to stress including length of time in the primary caregiver role, grandparentsÎ± income level, psychological well-being, parental confidence, and perceived social support. Eighty-three grandparents raising their grandchildren were recruited for this study from across the state using purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Respondents were asked to fill out a survey about their experience raising their grandchild(ren). A total of forty-four grandparents participated in this study. Data indicate that as grandparents continue in the parenting role, their parental confidence and perceived social support increases. Significant differences were noted between American Indian and Caucasian caregivers. For example, American Indian caregivers reported experiencing significantly more time in the caregiving role, reported lower incomes, and experienced more depressive symptoms than their Caucasian counterparts. The best predictors of parental stress were depression and parental confidence. As depression increased, stress likewise increased. As parental confidence increased, parental stress decreased. These findings hold important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

The problem addressed in this study was that the effect of emotional intelligence on leadership performance is not known. This study measured the emotional intelligence of elementary principals in Montana using the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal: There Is More Than IQ (Bradberry, & Greaves, 2003), which measures the following five categories of emotional intelligence: (1) self-awareness, (2) self-management, (3) social awareness, (4) relationship management, and (5) overall emotional intelligence. The principals' leadership performance was measured using the Educational Leadership Improvement Tool (DeFranco & Golden, 2003), which assesses a principal's leadership performance in the following 9 areas: (1) leadership attributes, (2) visionary leadership, (3) community leadership, (4) instructional leadership, (5) data-driven improvement, (6) organization to improve student learning, (7) organization to improve staff efficacy, (8) cultural competence, and (9) educational management. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence and elementary principals' leadership performance. A factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the influence of gender, age, and years of experience on emotional intelligence. Analysis of the data indicated that emotional intelligence, as defined by Goleman (1998), had a strong effect on the nine standards of leadership as defined by DeFranco & Golden (2003). Gender, age, and years of experience had no significant effects on emotional intelligence. The results of this research indicated that emotional intelligence has a positive effect on principals' leadership performance. This supports the body of research that emotional intelligence has a positive effect on leadership performance. Effective leadership requires a wide range of skills. Emotional intelligence is one skill that may assist principals as they strive to more effectively meet the needs of students.	['ability', 'leadership', 'educational leadership']

Privately owned forests play an important role in wildlife conservation because of land ownership and recreation trends in the United States. The implicit values in hunting lease markets are important to understanding market incentives of wildlife access leasing. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the underlying marginal values of annual hunting leases agreements. In this thesis, the hedonic valuation technique is used to empirically estimate two forms of consumer response: competitive bidding results in the Georgia hunting lease market and consumer response to take-it-or-leave-it prices in a Northern hunting lease market. The Georgia lease regressions use forest stand and regional attributes to predict observed lease prices. The Northern lease regressions use the firm's lease offering price and additional lease information to predict observed consumer response to lease offering prices. The consumer responses for the Northern regressions include lease applications per new hunting lease offering and renewal of pre-existing hunting lease agreements. The Georgia lease price regression results suggest statistically significant price determinants include the percentage of non-plantation acreage, distance from populations greater than 100,000 people, total county acres of public hunting access substitutes, and average forest property taxes paid per county. The Northern regression results indicate that the lease offering price, lease acres, distance from populations greater than 100,000 people, number of hunters per county, and predicted game crime prosecutions are statistically significant to predicting the number of lease applications received for each lease offering. The empirical results from the Northern lease renewal regression results suggest additional information not included in the firm's pricing methodology are jointly statistically significant to predicting lease renewals. The implicit values underlying hunting lease agreements are important for forest management, public hunting access, and lease pricing considerations; the results of this thesis identify lease and regional attributes that affect lease pricing.

Often times, it is common for teachers to teach these foundational skills over and over to ensure mastery prior to students' advancement. Given this fact, my capstone project was dedicated to increasing students' conceptual knowledge of mathematics through the use of concept mapping in the classroom. This project spanned a total of four math investigations, with two of the investigations taught using concept mapping in addition to the regular curriculum. Data collected to identify the effects of mapping on conceptual understanding, long-term memory, motivation and teacher professionalism included; preunit, postunit, and delayed assessments, interviews, journal entries, surveys, and the concept maps themselves. The results of the study were mixed. Concept mapping had positive impact on conceptual understanding in general. Data also indicate that mapping within the classroom increased student motivation. Finally, the results indicate that concept mapping had a positive impact on my goals as a teacher and my professionalism within the community.

The states included in this study were Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. The data for this study was collected using web based survey instruments. The population consisted of 61 pre-service agricultural education students. These students were enrolled in an agricultural education teaching methods class during the Fall 2002 semester, and planned on student teaching in a high school agricultural education program during the Spring or Fall 2003 semesters. A demographic survey, the Beliefs and Expectations about the First Year of Teaching, and the Academic Attributional Style Questionnaire (AASQ) were posted on a web site. The StrengthsFinderÂ® instrument was used by providing each respondent a copy of the book, Now, Discover Your Strengths (Buckingham and Clifton, 2001) and was found at a Gallup organization web site. Overall, respondents believed that they will perform better at the teaching tasks as outlined in the Beliefs and Expectations about the First Year of Teaching than their peers. Only three respondents were excessively pessimistic and only five respondents were overly optimistic as reported by the results of the AASQ. The top five first strengths on the StrengthsFinderÂ® profile as reported by the respondents were: ""Adaptability"", ""Input"", ""Achiever"", ""Learner"" and ""Developer"". Collectively, when the respondents were examined by looking at all three questionnaires, no overly pessimistic theme strengths were identified as measured by the AASQ and the Beliefs and Expectations surveys. A regression analysis, using a step-wise method was conducted. Only one independent variable, ""scholarship"" had a significant influence on the AASQ scores. StrengthsFinderÂ® themes ""Intellection"", ""Relator"", and ""Woo"" were identified as being overly optimistic, as measured by the AASQ. All groups felt that they would perform better than their peers at the teaching tasks presented by the Beliefs and Expecations instrument except the StrengthsFinderÂ® theme ""Restorative"". This group scored a 0.00, meaning the respondents think they will perform the same as their peers."

The first aspect involves direct observation of past eras of the Universe's formation. The detection of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was one of the most important cosmological discoveries of the last century. With the development of interferometric gravitational wave detectors, we may be in a position to detect its gravitational equivalent in this century. The Cosmic Gravitational Background is likely to be isotropic and stochastic, making it difficult to distinguish from instrument noise. The contribution from the gravitational background can be isolated by cross-correlating the signals from two or more independent detectors. Here we extend previous studies that considered the cross-correlation of two Michelson channels by calculating the optimal signal to noise ratio that can be achieved by combining the full set of interferometry variables that are available with a six link triangular interferometer. We apply our results to the detector design described in the Big Bang Observer mission concept study and find that it could detect a background with Omega gw > 2.2 x 10 -Â¹â·. The second aspect consists in studying astrophysical sources that detain crucial information on the Universe's evolution. We focus our attention on black holes binary sytems. These systems contain information on the rate of merger between galaxies, which in turn is key to unlock the mystery of inflation. Pulsar timing is a promising technique for detecting low frequency sources of gravitational waves, such as massive and supermassive black hole binaries. Here we show that the timing data from an array of pulsars can be used to recover the physical parameters describing an individual black hole binary to good accuracy, even for moderately strong signals. A novel aspect of our analysis is that we include the distance to each pulsar as a search parameter, which allows us to utilize the full gravitational wave signal. This doubles the signal power, improves the sky location determination by an order of magnitude, and allows us to extract the mass and the distance to the black hole binary.

Nine women completed a 90-minute submaximal cycling protocol in both a cold (-5Â°C) and temperate (24Â°C) environment. The dependent variables were heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), percent change in plasma volume (%DeltaPV), and percent change in body mass (%DeltaBM). A two-way RMANOVA was used to detect differences over time and temperature condition. Over time, HR, SBP, and RPE increased during exercise irrespective of temperature environment, while DBP did not change significantly. Between condition, %DeltaPV and %DeltaBM were significantly lower in the cold environment. The combination of results indicates that water is shifting out of the plasma volume, but is then being restored after termination of cold exposure and exercise.

Determining productive iterations is important to improve the design process on cost, time, and quality, but currently there is no categorization of iterations conducive to this goal. After exploring the possible causes and attempts to address them, I propose to classify iterations as rework, design, or behavioral. The framework suggests that design teams, to improve productivity, should try to eliminate rework by increasing the resolution of design information (design iterations) without skipping design levels and by developing alternative solutions (behavioral iterations) in parallel before selecting one. Analysis of journal data from twelve student projects helps identify design processes that achieve higher quality in less time. Factor analysis groups common variability into factors. A multivariate linear regression model of three factors explains 91% of productivity variance within the study sample. Factor scoring coefficients are then used to translate the regression model coefficients back to activities and design levels. Results indicate that generating ideas and defining the problem at a system level are the key discriminating variables between more or less productive design teams in the sample, which supports the recommendation of increasing the resolution of design information without skipping intermediate levels. If we consider selecting an alternative for the final solution as the main design decision students make in the sample projects, then work on non-selected alternatives before selecting the final design can be used as a proxy for effort allocated to behavioral iterations. A linear model using work on non-selected alternatives shows that generating ideas at a system level relates to higher productivity while refining design details and evaluating existing design configurations associate with lower productivity. Then behavioral iteration relates to higher productivity only if alternatives are developed to the system level by generating ideas on how to address interface and configuration issues. The framework presented in this thesis helps differentiate between productive and less productive iteration patterns and provides guidelines to prevent rework by allocating more effort in productive iteration, namely behavioral and design iteration.

Thus, evidence supports the hypothesis that inbreeding avoidance is achieved by means of male-biased dispersal in black bears. Our results also suggest the general pattern of male-biased dispersal is modified by competition for mates or resources.

Forty-seven students in three achievement levels were tracked for changes in their abilities to answer high-order questions, as well as changes in their attitudes and motivations. Teacher attitude and motivations were also measured. The study revealed that students showed overall improvement in high-order thinking compared to non-treatment, and that student attitudes and motivations improved slightly during the project. Teacher attitudes and motivations improved as students progressed through the treatment.	['life sciences', 'high school students', 'biology', 'students', 'science', 'persons']

Mountain-valley transition zones form part of the mountain front, influence groundwater (GW)-stream interactions, and impact hydrologic response and stream water composition. Mountain front recharge (MFR) in mountain-valley transition zones and subsequent GW discharge to streams in the valley bottom are important hydrological processes. These GW-stream interactions are dynamic in both space and time, playing a key role in regulating the amount, timing, and chemistry of stream water reaching the valley bottom. I hypothesize that mountain-valley transitions function as hydrologic and biogeochemical buffers via GW recharge and subsequent GW discharge. More specifically, that streams often recharge GW near the mountain front and receive stored GW further downstream. To investigate these processes I applied physical hydrology techniques, and geochemical hydrograph separations in the Humphrey Creek watershed in southwestern Montana. This allowed me to assess the spatial and temporal variability of mountain front GW recharge and GW-stream interactions across a mountain-valley transition. Geochemical signatures were used to partition stream flow into alpine runoff and GW sources. These results indicate that much of the alpine stream water recharged GW at the mountain front and that stored GW of a different chemical composition sustained down-valley stream discharge. Down-valley stream discharge was dominated by GW inputs and responded to GW stage more closely than upstream reaches. A critical GW stage height was necessary for down-valley channel flow, as this was the only major input to channel flow during early and late season base flow. Conversely, GW contributed little to stream flow in the upper reaches of the study area. GW-stream water exchange served as a flow and geochemical buffer, resulting in significant changes in stream chemistry from the alpine, to the MFR zone, to the valley bottom and muting fluctuations in channel flow, both at high and low flow. Implications are that mountain front GW recharge magnitudes can control valley aquifer storage state which combined with alpine runoff magnitude and valley bottom GW discharge controls stream water quantity and geochemical composition downstream.

It is commonly thought that men and women differ in the extent or frequency to which each exhibits various traits-especially traits that are frequently perceived to be more agentic and stereotypical of males (e.g., aggressive and forceful) or more communal and stereotypical of females (e.g., interpersonally sensitive and sympathetic). Further, stereotypes frequently influence behaviors, with many real-world consequences, not the least of which are those often manifested in the disparate treatment of men and women in the workplace. In a recent study (Martell & DeSmet, 2001), male MBA students rated male and female managers on 14 items considered important to achieving success as a manager. Because having a realistic job preview is an important component of success at one's work, the present study explored the accuracy of Business and Management students' perceptions of male stereotypes of female versus male managers' leadership abilities. Results revealed a remarkable ability of respondents to closely predict the previous men's responses. In comparing current respondents' ratings to Martell and DeSmet's males' ratings, few significant differences were observed between men's estimates of female managers' abilities and the current respondents' expectations of those men's beliefs.

Recent evidence suggests that decreases in habitat quality and availability of spring staging areas may have resulted in a decline of recruitment. Recently, stable isotopes analysis has emerged as a powerful ecological tool to measure the degree of cross-seasonal effects of birds. In 2006 through 2008 in southwestern Montana, I used carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) stable isotopes to assess how red blood cells (RBC), which is a proxy for stored body reserves (endogenous), change over time as local foods (exogenous) are consumed, and to estimate the relative contributions of endogenous reserves and exogenous foods for egg formation. From arrival through the egg laying period, 15N values of RBC decreased while 13C values became more stable, a pattern consistent with expectations of endogenous tissues equilibrating with local dietary sources. In 2006 and 2008, isotopic values for egg albumen and yolk protein were similar to those expected from local dietary sources, which indicated that most protein used for producing egg albumen and yolk protein was obtained on the breeding grounds (exogenous sources). In 2007, endogenous reserves contributed on average 26% and 10% more for producing albumen and yolk protein, respectively, than in 2006 and 2008 combined. Due to small differences in 13C values between female endogenous lipids upon arrival to the breeding grounds and those of local invertebrate lipids, it was not possible to separately estimate the contributions of endogenous and invertebrate lipids to egg lipid formation. My results suggest that local invertebrates and endogenous lipid reserves contributed on average 51% (SE = 7%) to egg lipid production. The remaining contributions to eggs were derived from local seed sources. Despite recent findings of reduced endogenous reserves during spring migration, results from the females in this study suggest that the amount of time that females spend on the breeding grounds prior to nest initiation may be adequate in some years to allow them to attain adequate exogenous foods for reproduction. Future isotopic research is now needed across latitudinal gradients, allowing length of prebreeding season to vary, while separating out the contribution from endogenous versus exogenous sources.

Diodes and transistors fabricated using carbon nanotubes are theoretically very promising. Although, experimentally these devices are challenging to successfully realize it is hoped that further research and improvements in fabrication procedures will yield devices which could match or surpass current CMOS technologies. However, there are still many areas that need to be improved before anyone sees these devices mass produced commercially. This thesis gives a detailed overview of the fundamentals of these devices which can be easily understood by someone with a typical electrical engineering background. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate both the theory behind these devices and to conduct a series of simulations in order to determine how they compare to ultimately scaled CMOS for high frequency applications by ignoring the challenges associated with fabricating these devices reliably. In other words, at best how could these devices perform if they could be mass produced with high yield compared to current technologies? First an introduction to carbon nanotubes and a review of relevant concepts from solid-state electronics will be given, followed by a brief overview of quantum theory for 1-D systems as it pertains to nanotube based electronics. This will then be used to develop models for a Schottky diode and Schottky barrier transistor. Simulations using these models were conducted that show the potential for these devices for high frequency electronics. These results are subsequently used to compare to current state-of-the-art technologies. Upon completion of the simulations in this thesis, it was determined that carbon nanotube based Schottky diodes and Schottky barrier transistors do not perform as well as current technologies in relation to applications for submillimeter/millimeter wave detection and analog circuits, even when assuming no limitations imposed due to poor fabrication.

The imager, designed at Montana State University, operates in five distinct wavebands in the visible region of the spectrum and is capable of imaging the overhead skylight hemisphere with a fisheye lens. This thesis describes the Mauna Loa deployment and presents an initial comparison of these data to those observed by Coulson with a zenith-slice polarimeter in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We show how the all-sky imaging technique yields additional insight to the nature of skylight polarization beyond what is observed in a single zenith scan. It was found that the skylight polarization data collected compared well to that collected by Coulson. Furthermore, the polarization signatures obtained over the two week deployment were found to depend inherently on the underlying cloud cover at altitudes beneath the observatory. The different cloud topologies provided variable upwelling unpolarized light which entered the field of view of the instrument. As a result, the anticipated polarization signatures were reduced by variable amounts from this increased unpolarized radiation countering the strong skylight polarization band observed at 90Â° from the sun. Finally, to quantify the nature of the upwelling scattered radiation from the clouds to the variation in the degree of polarization, the maximum degree of polarization was fit to a decreasing exponential trend versus upwelling radiance as obtained from overhead satellites. Statistical correlation for these quantities was found to be favorable and this result can potentially yield useful prediction ability for skylight polarization signatures in clear-sky conditions.

Whereas the influence of contralateral wrist AM placement has been evaluated in adults, no research has investigated the influence of wrist-worn AM location (dominant [D] versus non-dominant [ND] or left [LW] versus right [RW]) on measurements of free-living PA in adolescents. Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the influence of wrist-worn AM wear location (D versus ND and LW versus RW) and AM processing algorithm (single (1R) versus double (2R) regression) on measures of free-living PA in adolescents 12-17 years of age. Methods: Eight boys (MeanÂ±SD: 14.3Â±1.9 yrs, 53.9Â±13.6 kg, 160.5Â±14.5 cm, 20.6Â±2.3 body mass index [BMI]) and 12 girls (13.9Â±1.6 yrs, 56.1Â±9.9 kg, 160.3Â±7.4 cm, 21.4Â±2.6 BMI) participated in the study. Each subject wore two AMs for 7 consecutive days (24 hr/day), with one AM attached to the dorsal side of each wrist using locking plastic wrist bands. Subjects were instructed to engage in their usual daily activities. After downloading the raw AM data to a computer, previously validated algorithms (1R and 2R) were used to transform and summarize the data into counts (counts/day), activity energy expenditure (AEE; kcals/day), and duration of time (T; minutes/day) for 1, 5, and 10 minute bout durations within light (L) and moderate-to-vigorous (MV) intensity categories for AMs (D, ND and for LW, RW). Dependent variables (CNT, AEE, T) were compared using two-factor multivariate repeated measures ANOVA (alpha=0.05) for data processed by both algorithms separately. Scheffe's post-hoc analyses (alpha=0.01) were performed for all pairwise comparisons when indicated by the ANOVA. Results: No significant differences existed between mean values for dependent variables for any bout duration within L or MVPA intensity between monitors (D versus ND or between LW versus RW) or processing algorithm. Conclusion: These data indicate that wrist-worn AM location has no significant influence on PA outcome variables in adolescent under free-living conditions. Researchers can now allow participants the freedom to choose which wrist they would prefer the monitor be placed when being assessed.

The purposes of this study were (a) to determine if improvements in climbing performance and related physiological variables would result from systematic training on a motorized climbing treadmill, and (b) to compare the effectiveness of two types of prescribed cardiovascular training programs on a motorized climbing treadmill: high-intensity interval training (HIT) and endurance training (ET). Climbing-related anthropometric variables, climbing performance, climbing-specific cardiorespiratory fitness, and climbing-related muscular strength and endurance were measured on 27 volunteers (13 males, 14 females) between the ages of 18 and 37 years, prior to and following six weeks of systematic physical training using a motorized climbing treadmill. Subjects were randomly assigned to training groups, which were similar with regard to gender and climbing experience. The ET program consisted of a single 20-minute bout of climbing at 65-80% of measured pre-test 2peak O for each workout session,; the HIT program consisted of three 6-minute bouts of climbing at 80-95% of measured pre-test 2peak O V & , separated by three minutes of standing rest, for each workout session. Following training, climbing performance tended to be higher as a result of the HIT program compared to the ET program (p = 0.069), while climbing performance was significantly improved following training as a result of either program. Climbing-specific cardiorespiratory fitness did not differ between groups following training. With the exception of hand-grip strength, climbing-related muscular strength and endurance were significantly higher following training, with no differences observed between groups. Small yet significant improvements in climbing-related anthropometric variables were observed following training in both groups with no differences between groups. The results of this study show that six weeks of systematic physical training using a motorized climbing treadmill is capable of improving climbing performance, climbing-related strength and endurance, and climbing-related anthropometric variables. It was concluded that systematic training on a motorized climbing treadmill can be an effective method of increasing climbing-specific fitness and improving climbing performance.

From standard economic analysis, there are no apparent beneficiaries from price ceilings. Thus, the enactment of APG laws is puzzling from an economic perspective. The passage of APG laws is first analyzed with case studies of all thirty-one state laws. The case studies include information such as disasters that triggered the enactment of the laws, detail on enforcement and penalties, and information on supporters and opponents. This information is used to help determine why policymakers enact the laws. From the case studies, it is apparent that state officials devote significant resources to enforcing APG laws. Thus, it can be concluded that APG are not symbolic, toothless measures. A general lack of understanding of markets also appears to play a role in the laws' enactments. Additionally, there are case studies of twelve states that do not currently have APG laws. In general, these states have either taken enforcement action without APG laws or considered an APG bill that ultimately failed. The enactment of the laws is also investigated with statistical models. The passage of APG laws is found to be associated with disaster variables like precipitation, hurricanes, and earthquakes. There is mixed evidence that poorer states are more likely to enact APG laws. More Democratic states are not more apt to adopt APG laws. Lastly, income dispersion and gas prices have no measurable effect on APG law passage.	['legislation']

MAP math test scores and teacher input were used to group the students by their ability. This treatment was implemented to see if there was a change in student achievement and to see if there were any student attitude changes about math. The post-treatment results indicated that students MAP test scores varied greatly for each individual but 82% of students increased their scores from the pre to post-treatment. The results indicated that the percent increase in MAP test scores were the highest during the pretreatment. The above grade level students had a 6.5% increase, at grade level had a 5.5% increase, and the below grade level had a 6.8% increase in their MAP test scores. During the post-treatment the group of students that were most affected by the ability grouping were the above grade level students. They had a 4.2% increase in their MAP test scores during the treatment year. The students that were at grade level had a 2.3% increase in their MAP test scores. The students that were negatively affected by the ability grouping were the below grade level students. They increased their scores by .3% in the treatment year. AIMSweb Concepts and Applications increased following the treatment from 8.1% to a 16% increase in the test scores. AIMSweb Computation scores decreased in overall percent gains from a 17.7% to an 11.1% following the treatment. Students' attitudes about math were more positive after the treatment but the students said that there was little benefit to their science class when they were in ability groped math class.

In the social contagion paradigm, participants are exposed to the erroneous memory reports of a confederate after viewing a series of schematically arranged household scenes. Age differences were examined at two levels. First, participant age was manipulated in order to determine whether older adults were more susceptible to socially encountered misinformation than young adults. Second, the age of the source of misinformation was manipulated to determine how perceptions of the source may influence contagion. The results indicated that suggestions of older adult confederates impact participants' memory reports less than the suggestions of young adults in free recall. However, the mechanism for this effect differs in terms of participant age. Young adult participants appear to discount the suggestions of older adult confederates, while older adult participants appear to devote less processing to the collaboration of the older confederate. Additionally, older adults were not more susceptible to social contagion than were young adults, even when given more time to view the stimuli.

Potential exists for substantial effects on aquatic ecosystems because CBNG development involves production and disposal of large quantities of CBNG product water that differs from surface waters and alters natural flow regimes. In 2005 and 2006, I compared fish assemblages in streams with (treatment) and without (control) CBNG development, determined fish presence, growth, and survival in streams composed entirely of product water, and compared fish assemblages at multiple points above and below development to determine the effects of coalbed natural gas development on fish assemblages in the Powder River Basin. Some evidence suggested CBNG development had little or no effect on fish. For example, species richness and index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were similar between developed and undeveloped sites, and no strong relationships existed between overall IBI scores or most IBI metric scores and the number or density of CBNG wells in a drainage area. Streams composed largely or entirely of product water were inhabited by reproducing populations of several species of fish. Other evidence suggested that CBNG may negatively affect fish assemblages over time. Conductivity was on average higher in treatment streams and was negatively related to biotic integrity. Bicarbonate, one of the primary salts in product water, appeared to be harmful to some species of fish. One salt-tolerant non-native species, northern plains killifish, was observed almost exclusively in treatment streams. The study was limited by a lack of pre-development data, unquantifiable product-water discharges, and because it was conducted during dry years. Potential effects of CBNG development may be more apparent during wet years when more sensitive fish assemblages are present. Monitoring efforts, development of a bicarbonate water quality standard, and efforts towards requiring complete product-water discharge reporting should continue.

In order to understand the extent of such effects, this thesis examines the resonance between maps and theater in Early Modern England using Shakespeare's Antony of Antony and Cleopatra as a model for how individuals may have responded to maps in Early Modern England. The subject of conflicting spatial desires, Antony and his very body become a site of tension and resistance both within the play and upon the stage.

This investigation studied the effect of service- learning on attendance, attitude, and achievement of at- risk high school biology students. Students participated in two community service- learning projects: raising trout for release into local streams and/or implementing a vegetable garden on high school property. Data collected included attendance records of students both prior to the projects and during the projects. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess the confidence factor, and pre- and post-project content questions were administered to assess the achievement portion of the research. An improvement in confidence or attitude was documented, but it did not correlate to a significant improvement in attendance or achievement. Therefore, the results are inconclusive and indicate a longer-term study is warranted."	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

However, my students' interest in science did not increase and may have actually decreased. Finally, my level of organization did not necessarily get better, but I did become better at identifying what I wanted my students to do, what successful completion of that task would look like, and how I would evaluate it.

Cytokines are cell signaling proteins with multiple functions including control of inflammation. Cytokines are influenced by several factors such as carbohydrate intake and exercise. Thus, carbohydrate intake and exercise can influence inflammation. Purpose: To determine the influence of high carbohydrate intake on the inflammatory response to exercise that induces muscle damage and inflammation. Methods: The study was a cross-over design. Each subject completed a high carbohydrate condition and a high fat and protein condition. Each condition consisted of 6 sets of 10 maximal high-force eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors and extensors. The exercise was followed by a controlled diet for the first 8 hours post-exercise based on the condition. The cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1B (IL-B) were measured as indicators of local inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured as an indicator of systemic inflammation. Creatine-kinase (CK), muscle soreness, upper arm circumference, and strength loss were measured as indicators of muscle damage. Blood glucose and insulin were measured to identify differences between diets in the conditions. Results: Insulin was significantly increased in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition at 1.5, 4, and 8 hours post-exercise. Perceived soreness was elevated at all time points post-exercise in both conditions and was significantly elevated in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition. There was a main effect trend for IL-6 to be greater in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition. Il-1B was significantly increased 24 hours post-exercise in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition. Conclusion: Elevated carbohydrate intake post-exercise augmented the local inflammatory response to the exercise observed by elevated IL-1B and IL-6. The augmented inflammatory response contributed to greater perceived muscle soreness post-exercise. Further research is required to investigate this mechanism further to provide better prevention and treatment methods for chronic diseases related to inflammation.

Approaches designed to illuminate how we view films, and make films, often limit our thinking, instead. It is not surprising that the analysis of such an extraordinary medium presents endless arguments, debate and inspires the critic or theorist to narrow the field of view in order to make it manageable. Recent work in the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience which, when applied to our critical analyses of film, is changing the discipline of film studies. In conjunction with traditional narratology, this interdisciplinary approach enables us to reconfigure the relationship between narrative and spectacle, creating a triangular relationship that draws attention to discourse. This triangular approach affords a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of how science documentaries affect viewers. In turn, these analyses encourage science filmmakers to recognize discourse as a means of creating more emotionally powerful, aesthetically coherent, and memorable science films. Like a great mind, the discipline of film studies flourishes most when it remains open. The creation of this triangular analytical relationship is merely one way of enhancing our ability to study the effects films have on an audience, on the future of the medium, and on aesthetics as a whole. In seeking an academic and theoretical basis for the gut level notion that films affect us both emotionally and intellectually, it is critical to chart an interdisciplinary course.

American Indians are disproportionately affected by STIs, including chlamydia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Roosevelt County, which lies within the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana, has consistently reported chlamydia rates two to five times higher than national rates. Community leaders from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation partnered with researchers from Montana State University to address the reservation's sexual and reproductive health needs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the heterosexual relationship factors that were associated with condom use intentions for STD and HIV prevention in a purposive sample of American Indian men, ages 18 to 24, living on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. A community based participatory research (CBPR) approach was used for this study. A non-probability sample of American Indian men (n=122) were recruiting using consecutive and snowball sampling techniques. Study hypotheses were tested using Pearson's chi-squared and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis for bivariate associations and multinomial logistic regression for multivariate associations. Variables examined for their association with condom use intentions included age, educational attainment, relationship type, relationship duration, relationship commitment, condom use communication, condom use decision making, control of condom use, and negative partner reaction to condom use. Results indicated that American Indian men were less likely to use condoms for disease prevention as their age and their relationship commitment increased. Factors resulting in an increased likelihood of future condom use included high participation in the condom use decision making process and female control over condom use. Culturally relevant sexual risk prevention programs that work towards changing the perception of condoms in committed relationships and that engage men in sexual health decision making could help reduce the disproportionate burden of sexually transmitted disease carried by young American Indians living on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.

In addition, I used an iterative writing approach and review process that replicates the process of writing in scientific research. Students were asked to write subsections of a scientific journal-style lab report in the same order as a scientist would write these subsections. Then, each subsection underwent a self- or instructor-review or a peer-review process. The peer review process that was used closely mimicked the process used by scientists when they submit a manuscript for publication in a scientific journal. To determine the effectiveness of these interventions, I gathered data using student interviews, attitude surveys, skills tests, lab reports and exam results. The iterative peer review process benefitted most students, particularly the high-achievers. Although students' general lab-report writing skills and ability to cite and reference sources improved, there was less improvement on lab report subsections requiring deeper analysis and reflection. Students' already positive attitudes improved, although there was no clear short-term benefit to content mastery.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

However, there is a known association between increasing body mass index (BMI) and decreasing pedometer accuracy. The decrease in pedometer accuracy has been attributed to tilt angle, but the specific tilt angle where pedometers fail to maintain accuracy is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test two popular pedometer mechanisms, accelerometry- and pendulum-based, to determine the specific tilt angle where the pedometers fail to maintain step counts accurately. METHODS: Twenty subjects (10 men, MeanÂ±SD: 25.4Â±4.2 yrs, 184.4Â±5.3 cm, 76.7Â±6.3 kg; 10 women: 21.6Â±3 yrs, 166.1Â±6.3 cm, 56.7Â±6.7 kg) walked two sets of 21 trials at a combination of treadmill speed (67.0, 80.4, 93.8 m/min) and tilt angle (-30,-20,-10, 0,+10,+20,+30Â°) while wearing two pedometers; the experimental pedometer attached to a custom-built pedometer gimbal for altering tilt angle, and the control pedometer in a neutral position (Â±2Â° of 0Â°). The pedometers were worn on each hip just anterior to the iliac crest in line with the mid-axillary line of the thigh. The first set of trials tested one pedometer mechanism, while the second set of trials tested the second pedometer mechanism in a counterbalanced order. Mean steps from the experimental pedometer were compared to the control pedometer for each trial (ÃStep=Experimental-Control) using a 3-factor RMANOVA at an alpha level of 0.05. RESULTS: Mean Ãsteps for the accelerometry-based pedometer and the pendulum-based pedometer differed significantly (P<0.05) at tilt angles >Â±10Â° for treadmill speeds <or equal to 67.0 and 80.4 m/min, respectively. However, mean Ãsteps across treadmill speeds was much lower for the accelerometry-based pedometer (MeanÂ±SE: 4.9Â±1.9, 2Â±1.9, 4Â±1.9, 5Â±1.9, 4Â±1.9, 9Â±1.9 steps) than the pendulum-based pedometer (14.1Â±1.9, 4.2Â±1.9, 8.9Â±1.9, 6.8Â±1.9, 6Â±1.9, 38.1Â±1.9 steps) across conditions > 0Â° (-30, -20, -10, +10, +20, +30Â°, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing tilt angle caused a decrease in pedometer accuracy for both pedometer mechanisms, although the accelerometry-based pedometers were less affected. Negative tilt angles had less effect on pedometer accuracy than positive tilt angles, and the combination of increasing positive tilt angle and slower speeds had the greatest impact on step count accuracy.

From 1990 to 2007, the childhood obesity rate in Montana has grown from affecting nine percent of the population of children to twenty-seven present (Daphane, 1990; NICH, 2007). The study's purpose is to examine family eating and activity habits that directly impact the likelihood of a child to develop childhood obesity including activity level, stimulus exposure, eating related to hunger, and eating styles. The instrument used in this research study was the Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire contained four subcategories including activity level, stimulus exposure, eating related to hunger, and eating style. The Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire use a wide variety of fill in the blank questions and rating scales in order to examine each of the subcategories. The specific target population for this study was parents who reside in the western rural state of Montana based on a convenience sample. The sample population was parents, with children between the ages of five to thirteen, who were willing to complete a parental questionnaire. The parental questionnaires were distributed in March and April of 2011 in two elementary schools. After the parental questionnaires were collected, the parental questionnaire scores were measured by adding up the mean of each score; the mother, father, child, and total family score. The central tendency of the data was analyzed and compared with the mean total score establish in the previous Family Activity and Eating Habit Questionnaire results. In the activity level section, the M score was 21.8. The SD computed was 22.96. In the stimulus exposure section, the M score was 10.7. The SD computed was 4.05. In the eating related to hunger section, the M score was 5.5. The SD computed was 2.42. In the eating styles section, the M score was 42. The SD computed was 15.07. In the overall scoring of the survey, the M score was 80. The results of overall score indicate that the higher the total scores, the less appropriate the eating and activity patterns.

This study was guided by the research question, ""How do principal leadership behaviors and organizational routines contribute to the high achievement of Montana's distinguished Title I Schools?"" A supporting subquestion for principal leadership behaviors was, ""How does relational trust contribute to the high achievement of Montana's distinguished Title I schools?"" A supporting subquestion for organizational routines was, ""How does collective teacher efficacy contribute to the high achievement of Montana's distinguished Title I schools?"" The purpose of this embedded multiple-case study was to describe the role played by principal leadership behaviors and organizational routines in Montana's award-winning Title I schools. Three Montana Title I schools, each of which had been recognized by the Office of Public Instruction as Distinguished Title I Schools for exceptional student achievement, 2006 to 2010, were included in the study. Following Yin's (2009) recommendation, the following data collection methods were utilized: principal and teacher interviews, focus group discussions, observation of building principals, document collection, and administration of quantitative questionnaires on transformational leadership and collective teacher efficacy. Data on principal leadership behaviors was pattern-matched to the theoretical propositions of transformational leadership and relational trust. Data on organizational routines was pattern-matched to the theoretical propositions of professional learning communities and collective teacher efficacy. This study found that principal leadership behaviors of transformational leadership and relational trust had contributed to high student achievement in the schools studied, as had professional learning communities and collective teacher efficacy. The study's cross-case analysis also revealed conclusions, which had not been reported in previous research, in regard to transformational leadership practices, relational trust, and collective teacher efficacy."

However, there has been little research done using LC with learning science concepts. LC can be used for encouraging the unmotivated students to read to acquire content knowledge. Working with peers promotes accuracy and enjoyment of the subject. When students are expected to prepare to respond to selected readings they pay more attention to the content of their reading selections. LC promotes metacognitive awareness. Students answered survey questions reporting their use of various reading strategies; this awareness helped them build self-monitoring techniques. Building self-monitoring techniques is essential toward learning difficult content. Based on the data, students who are more metacognitively aware of their learning are more successful in class. Using LC, students are better prepared for formative assessments, as well as summative assessments.

Qualitative focus group data was used to construct a list of characteristics/qualities grounded in community values and a list of effective teachers was compiled through ""community nomination"". A collective case study gathered the living educational theories and teaching philosophies of six nominated teachers, compared these to the community-determined characteristics/qualities, and examined elements of each teacher's life history that played a role in developing and informing each effective teacher's pedagogy. It was determined that conscientization played a significant role in molding effective pedagogy, and social intelligence provided the precursory relationships that allowed teachers to effectively teach students according to a responsive pedagogy in the optimal zone of cognitive efficiency.

The purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore factors that help or hinder successful completion of a bachelor's degree by students from the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Data was collected in face-to-face interviews using a peer-reviewed interview protocol consisting of open-ended questions for graduates and student services personnel determined by the concepts identified after examination of related literature. Thirty graduates from the Chippewa Cree Tribe and 5 student services personnel from two state colleges in Montana were interviewed. Factors that the graduates found most relevant to their success were family, personal goal, friends, institutional support, and academic preparation. The greatest obstacles they reported were finances, loneliness, commuting, life responsibilities, discouragement, unpreparedness for college work, lack of study skills, and lack of time-management skills. Suggestions to improve the graduation rate for new students included persistence, responsibility, preparation for the transition from high school to college, time management, willingness to leave their comfort zone and develop their social skills, study skills, class attendance, willingness to ask for help, lack of discouragement, academic preparedness, and completion of school work. Recommendations include designing recruiting and retention strategies to meet the specific needs of the Native American student, collaborating with K-12 schools and the community to develop programs that encourage early preparation for college, establishing and advertising Native American centers on campuses, organizing professional development seminars on diversity issues designed to give faculty and staff a safe environment to explore different cultures, encouraging increased faculty-student interactions, creating an advisory committee charged with increasing Native American student retention, recognizing and giving appreciation for success, developing a comprehensive college finance and budgeting workshop that includes the student's whole family, and developing and maintaining an up-to-date data base within the Chippewa Cree Tribe to collect data on educational and cultural issues.

Twenty tenured faculty members from five different disciplines in the liberal arts, humanities, social sciences, fine arts, and education programs at this land grant, Doctoral II University were asked to participate in the study. Professors were selected purposefully from liberal arts, humanities, social sciences, fine arts, and education faculty who were tenured and had at least ten years experience and were available for interview in the spring/summer of 2004. Participants were asked to respond to open ended questions and statements. Data were collected through one-on-one interviews. The purpose of this grounded theory study is to investigate why tenured faculty at MSU-Bozeman choose to remain in their faculty positions and to generate a motivational theory using a construct-oriented approach. An audit of the study's data collection processes, analysis, and conclusions was conducted to confirm the validity of the findings. The results of this study revealed that tenured faculty at MSU-Bozeman were motivated to remain in their positions by, (1) their families, (2) a desire to remain in the geographical area, and, (3) as a result of having achieved tenure. These three facets of employment at MSU-Bozeman were overwhelmingly cited by study participants as motivation to remain in their positions. These three motivational factors evidenced underpinnings of need, emotion, and intellectual evaluation. The participants were motivated by the interaction of emotion, need, and intellect. In this respect, the theory of motivation generated as a result of the data unearthed by this study took a new step in the development of motivational theory, and moved beyond the boundaries set by Maslow (1943), Herzberg (1966), and Goleman (1998) to define a new paradigm of motivational theory, functional within the context of higher education, as well as a new definition of human behavior applicable within the confines of an industrialized society, inclusive of elements of all three theories. The new three-pronged theory defines need, emotion, and intellect as three interactive motivational forces determining human behavior within the context of the university in industrialized society.

Several control methods have been developed in hopes of increasing range productivity for domestic livestock grazing. Spraying with 2,4- D, burning, plowing and seeding, and rotocutting are the primary means of controlling sagebrush. The objective of this thesis was to conduct an economic comparison among these four Wyoming big sagebrush control methods and determine optimal retreatment intervals. Production of perennial grasses was measured on experimental plots in southwestern Montana 12 years during the period 1963-1986. The data were used to estimate the treatment response function. Sagebrush control is a stochastic dynamic problem and as such the problem was formulated within a stochastic dynamic programming framework. The economic criterion was the expected present value of additional net returns from sagebrush treatment. Decision alternatives included in the DP model were keeping or retreating the sagebrush. The state variables were years since treatment and expected value of forage yield per AUM which was defined as a function of calf price. Based upon a statistically estimated second-order autoregressive difference equation, the calf price transition probability distribution was developed. Given the data available to this study, Wyoming big sagebrush treatment methods of spraying and burning were economically feasible, with spraying the most profitable. Rotocutting was only marginally feasible, and plowing and seeding was not feasible. From the study results it was also concluded that in addition to treatment method., treatment cost and the quantity of sagebrush killed, the expected present value of additional net return and optimal retreatment interval also depend upon previous calf price trend.

As part of this effort quaking aspen response to fire was evaluated in two sub-drainages of the Whitetail Basin three years after treatment. Unburned stands were first surveyed to determine whether regeneration was occurring and to measure the distribution of aspen stems by size class. This information was then compared to stem response in burned stands. Big game and cattle impacts on aspen sucker height and density were measured using a series of 3-part ungulate exclosures in a sub-sample of burned stands. Regeneration was occurring in only1 of 40 unburned stands suggesting aspen was declining in this area. Sucker density increased dramatically in the burned stands after three years increasing the likelihood for regeneration. Within the first three years post-fire big game and the combination of big game and cattle did not affect sucker density in the burned stands. Although sucker height was significantly less in plots used by ungulates we did not feel it was enough to prevent regeneration. This assertion was supported by sufficient annual growth rates and the recruitment of individual regeneration stems into stands outside of protected plots. While it appears fire has increased the potential for aspen regeneration in the Whitetail Basin, early growth rates have allowed for some individual stem to surpass browse height to date, suggesting future monitoring will be necessary to learn if the current recruitment levels are sufficient to regenerate the majority of stands.

Drivers execute many tasks in order to safely and efficiently maneuver their vehicles in these systems. Evaluation of vehicle speed (ego motion) and inter-vehicle distance (egocentric distance) are crucial skills and constant demands while operating a motor vehicle. Common maneuvers such as braking, obstacle avoidance, and overtaking rely heavily on such skills. Driving skills and transportation safety concerns in general have been studied over the years by many research methodologies. One such methodology, the driving simulator, has emerged as a leading research tool to help understand driver behavior and mitigate traffic safety concerns. The overall effectiveness of driving simulation as a research tool is linked to how accurately modern technology can model reality. Therefore determining how valid simulators are in representing reality is a chief concern among researchers, as validity ensures accuracy and credibility of research efforts. Simulation validity is established both physically and behaviorally. The objective of this project was to conduct a driving simulator experiment to examine the perceptual and behavioral effects of various parameters of the simulation deemed relevant from theories of ego motion. Twenty drivers completed speed and following distance perception tasks (absolute production, fixed-increase production, and ratio production) while driving through rural road scenarios that varied in the presentation of motion, field of view, and optic flow. Tasks and dependent variables assessed driver perception of speeds (25-65 MPH) and following distances (150-300 ft) common in everyday driving. The study concluded that field of view (FOV) and optic flow simulation parameters were significant to the perception of absolute speed, with high levels of each parameter (large FOV, high optic flow) resulting in more accurate perception than low levels (small FOV, low optic flow). Also, participants perceived a high level of field of view as significantly more natural than a low level of field of view. The results of this study will add to the existing simulator body of knowledge and will also allow the researchers to quantify the relative importance of simulation parameters as a basis for future behavioral validation of the driving simulator.

Field measurements of NâO emissions are limited for cropping systems in the semi-arid Northern Great Plains (NGP). The study objectives were to determine temporal NâO emission patterns for NGP cropping systems, and estimate fertilizer N induced emissions (FIE) and contrast with IPCC default methodology. No-till (NT) wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.)-fallow, wheat-wheat, and wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.), and a conventional till (CT) wheat-fallow all with three N regimes (200 and 100 kg N ha-1 available N, unfertilized N control); plus a perennial grass system (CRP) were sampled over two years (15 Apr 2004 - 14 Apr 2006) using static chambers. Nitrous oxide emissions over two years were 209 to 1310 g N ha-1 for the cropping systems. Greatest NâO emission activity occurred following urea-N fertilization (10-wk) and freeze-thaw cycles. The sum for these periods comprised 73-84% of total emissions. Emissions were positively correlated with urea-N fertilization rates and increased rapidly when water-filled pore was > 50%. Total NâO-N emissions were greater (P < 0.10) from the fertilized (high and moderate N regimes) wheat-wheat system (1193g ha-1) than fertilized wheat-fallow systems (CT and NT) (475 g ha-1), and fertilized wheat-pea (711 g ha-1) systems. Emissions from unfertilized cropping systems (209 to 329 g ha-1) were not different from CRP (284 g ha-1). Tillage (CT vs. NT) did not (P greater than or equal to 0.10) affect NâO emissions in the wheat-fallow systems. Fertilizer loss coefficients ranged from 0.08 to 0.45% of the applied N rate and were well below the IPCC loss coefficient of 1.25%. A more realistic estimate of fertilizer-induced losses for this region is suggested at 0.24% Â± 0.5 (Â± 1.0 SE) of the applied N rate, or 0.26% if 10% NHâ(g) loss from fertilizer N is assumed. Despite modest emissions compared to more humid regions, there was some evidence emissions could be reduced by efficient N management. Broadcast applying urea-N to established stands of winter wheat in the spring resulted in lower NâO emissions than band applications at seeding.

This paper argues that policy-driven transaction costs are an important trade-hindering factor. More specifically, this paper examines the allocation of property rights under the No-Injury Rule, which gives rights to riparian users, and Water Code 386, which gives quasi-blocking rights to third-parties, making water rights less clear. Both laws are predicted to decrease the likelihood of observing an active export market and the volume of exports in the county. To test these predictions, this paper uses the cross sectional variation in the number of riparian rights holders and the number of third-parties to estimate their effect on all county-level water trades in California from 1990 to 2001. The empirical results show that the effect of Water Code 386 on exports is inconclusive. The results for the No-Injury Rule indicates that for the average county, a one standard deviation increase in the ratio of riparian rights holders to the total population will decrease the likelihood that the county will have an active export market by 30 percent and will decrease the ratio of exports to appropriations by 7.4 percent. This suggests that if California's goal is, as stated in the 1970's, to reallocate water to its highest valued use via water markets, the current allocation of property rights may be creating policy-driven costs that hinder reaching that goal.

In an attempt to prevent further decline of this population, GNP is considering implementing a lake trout suppression program. I used ultrasonic telemetry to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of lake trout and gill nets to evaluate population characteristics and diet. Model simulations were used to predict lake trout responses to varying levels of suppression. I relocated 36 lake trout (508-859 mm total length) 1,137 times from June through November 2003 and March through November 2004. Lake trout had a narrow vertical distribution during all seasons in both 2003 and 2004, rarely occupying depths >30 m. During thermal stratification, lake trout occupied depths in the upper hypolimnion where mean temperature varied from 8-9Â°C and dissolved oxygen was highest. Lake trout typically were suspended in the water column during all seasons except autumn. When spawning commenced in late-October, lake trout were associated with littoral habitats containing clean cobble and boulder substrates. The lake trout population had a broad age structure and a maximum age of 37 years. Males reached maturity earlier (12 years) than females (15 years), and total annual mortality rate for lake trout ages 8-27 was 13.2%. Growth rates were slow and relative weight values were among the lowest observed for lake trout throughout their range. Food habits were sampled from 254 lake trout, and 95% of the diet by weight consisted of fish prey. Model simulations indicated that substantial population reduction could be achieved with moderate exploitation (20-50%); however, this was more easily achieved as the size at which lake trout could effectively be captured was reduced. Simulations suggested that recruitment could be reduced to a level where adults are not being replaced at low exploitation (10-30%). These data will allow suppression efforts to be focused at times and places that will maximize efficiency, and population simulations suggest that substantial reduction of the lake trout population is feasible. Ultimately, results from this study should promote recovery of bull trout in Lake McDonald.	['mortality']

Using some of the ideas of Zygmunt Bauman, Jacques Derrida, Neil Evernden, Claude Levi-Strauss, Bill Nichols, Nell Noddings, JosÃ© Ortega y Gasset, Edward Said, and Erwin Straus, I observe this problem to be a result of dispassionate humanism-a machineworld story considered appropriate in the current social construction. From this critical perspective, I then analyze Aldo Leopold's The Land Ethic and the Disney/Pixar film WALL-E. The former I show to be written in such a way as to leave its audience confused. The latter I demonstrate fosters unnecessary and immoral assumptions about the ""imminent"" collapse of our civilization. In conclusion, I make clear that it is how we relate to our current existence that is important. While the power of our ideas is truly humankind's greatest creation, that power is naught outside of time and the realities of our being Earth-bound.

To describe ungrazed vegetation of thirty sites well dispersed along the 500 mile length of the Yellowstone River. And to measure the effects of gazing on this vegetation by describing/comparing vegetation of these ungrazed 'control' sites with the vegetation of nearby grazed sites. Vegetation of the Yellowstone consists of three lateral bands on open shore (gravel or sandbar), willow thicket, and cottonwood forest. Their appearance on successively older deposits suggests control both by decreasing water availability (greater depth to water on inland sites with 'over deposits') and increasing age (overtopping, first by willow and then by cottonwood, and accumulation of shrubs). The primary longitudinal (downstream) change between foothill and plains sites, probably driven by decreasing rainfall, was the change of forest dominant from P. angustifolia to P. deltoides. The apparent failure of P. deltoides reproduction could eventually eliminate the forest zone. Grazing affects all of the five communities identified. With grazing, overall cover decreased in every vegetation type, with the greatest losses in sandbars, willow thickets and P angustifolia forests. Cottonwood seedlings were grazed on bars and in willow thickets. Cover of hydric (Salix spp., Cornus, Ribes spp.) and mesic (Symphoricarpos) native shrubs was significantly reduced. Rosa spp. lost cover with trampling. Invasive shrubs Russian olive and tamarisk, downstream, are apparently unaffected by grazing, except indirectly as grazing reduces their competition. Forb cover was most affected in Populus forests, with natives declining and non-natives increasing with grazing. Non-native grasses, the dominant herbs in cottonwoods, become more dominant with grazing. Observation of the exotics present emphasized the equal or greater impact of their invasion. Cover of exotics rises laterally from shore (50% with equal grass/forb composition) through willow thicket (70%, mostly exotic grass) to cottonwood forest (76-78%). The diversity of exotic herbs increases (laterally and downstream.). In the shrub layer Russian olive and tamarisk, pests in the American Southwest, increased greatly in the Plains in the 1980-2000 period and have a potential to dominate the forest and willow zones respectively. The ecosystem impacts of exotic increase will likely modify aesthetics, wildlife, and ranching drastically.

However, the ammonia introduced by chloramination can lead to nitrification which results in the production of nitrite and nitrate, leading to regulatory violations. Nitrification in reactors with copper and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces was established by indigenous organisms from Bozeman tap water and has been stably maintained for more than 6 years. Statistical analyses of polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiles determined that the active bacterial populations were different in the two systems. The assemblage of the organisms was also different from the starting population (BAC influent) suggesting both material and ammonia/carbon source affect the population. No known ammonia oxidizing bacteria were detected suggesting the role of different group for ammonia oxidation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected archaea in the biofilm from both reactors. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were found to be phylogenetically affiliated with known archaeal ammonia oxidizers. Two archaeal amoA sequences were amplified from the system as determined by DGGE. We propose to provisionally classify a detected archaeon as Candidatus Nitrosotenuis bozemanii, based on its affinity to Nitrosotenuis uzonensis (Hatzenpichler et al., in preparation). Bacterial abundances were comparable in the two systems but archaeal abundances were higher in the PVC reactor suggesting material effect on the overall microbial population composition and density. Enrichment in modified synthetic Crenarchaeota medium yielded a culture of archaea and bacteria that consistently oxidizes ammonia to nitrate. Attempts to isolate the archaeal component using antibiotics failed, suggesting the disruption of a possible beneficial relationship between the archaea and bacteria. Genes involved in the transformation of nitrogen within the system were also investigated and hao distantly related to that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was detected but its potential role remains unknown. This study provides evidence of archaea associated with biofilms in drinking water and while further analysis is needed to definitively elucidate their role, results of this study prompts the reevaluation of the current concept of nitrification in drinking water.

Students were exposed to a variety of problem-solving scenario activities including video, written, and hands-on activities that related biology content to real-world applications. The project began with a nontreatment unit on DNA structure and function where students were engaged in traditional biology learning activities that included reading, lecture, video, labs, and hands-on simulations. Students were then exposed to two treatment units, one on gene expression and mutation and the other on natural selection. During both treatment units students engaged in a variety of problem-solving scenarios for the purpose of connecting biology content to real-world applications with the hope of improving student understanding and motivation. Scenarios included video, reading, and simulation case studies on a variety of topics. Data were collected using student preunit and postunit assessments, surveys, and interviews with concept mapping as a measure of student content understanding, higher-order thinking, and motivation. In addition, teacher data were collected using classroom observations and teacher reflections to gain understanding of student motivation, as well as, teacher motivation and pedagogy. The data showed improvement of student understanding and motivation, especially when a combination of problem-solving case studies included hands-on scenarios activities.

Both town and city had their start at almost exactly the same time during the early 1880s. Sand Coulee was well known throughout the territory because of the tremendous coal field that J. J. Hill exploited to fuel his Great Northern Railway that connected the Twin Cities of Minnesota with the Pacific Northwest. The biggest repository of Sand Coulee history is a small history written by Ruby Giannini titled ""A History of Sand Coulee"" and a book titled ""The Gulch Area History"" written by a committee of area residents. ""The Gulch Area History"" is a genealogy of the area. These two books are the only ones specifically written about Sand Coulee and neither includes documentation. This thesis is heavily documented so that those who disagree with this history or its conclusions will be able to compare sources. Because of Sand Coulee's coal mining importance, its history resides in many newspapers, magazines, official state reports and history books. The footnotes and bibliography of this thesis give the historian a sense for the wide range of material available in bits and scraps about Sand Coulee. This thesis covers areas that are relatively unexplored in Sand Coulee's history, but there is still a lot of history to be written about Sand Coulee."	['history']

The presence of both chlorine and silicon in chlorosilane species creates unique corrosion environments due to the ability of many metals to form both metal-chlorides and metal-silicides, and it is further complicated by the fact that many metal-chlorides are volatile at high-temperatures while metal-silicides are generally stable. To withstand the uniquely corrosive environments, expensive alloys are often utilized, which increases the cost of final products. This work focuses on the corrosion behavior of iron, the primary component of low-cost alloys, and AISI 316L, a common low-cost stainless steel, in environments representative of industrial processes. The experiments were conducted using a customized high temperature chlorosilane corrosion system that exposed samples to an atmospheric pressure, high temperature, chlorosilane environment with variable input amounts of hydrogen, silicon tetrachloride, and hydrogen chloride plus the option of embedding samples in silicon during the exposure. Pre and post exposure sample analysis including scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and gravimetric analysis showed the surface corrosion products varied depending on the time, temperature, and environment that the samples were exposed to. Most commonly, a volatile chloride product formed first, followed by a stratified metal silicide layer. The chlorine and silicon activities in the corrosion environment were changed independently and were found to significantly alter the corrosion behavior; a phenomenon supported by computational thermodynamic equilibrium simulations. It was found that in comparable environments, the stainless steel corroded significantly less than the pure iron. This is likely due to the alloying elements present in stainless steel that promote formation of other stable silicides. Mechanistic models were developed to describe the formation and evolution of metal silicide and/or metal chloride surface corrosion products in chlorosilane environments. These models will help inform materials selection and/or support process development for next-generation chlorosilane-based production and deposition systems. The implementation of low cost materials of construction in these systems could lower the cost of final products in these industries.

This illness may be managed with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, which requires specialized training and expertise for staff nurses. A microsystem assessment was completed on an inpatient medical, surgical, oncology unit at a northwest Montana hospital. Nurses in the microsystem expressed the inability to maintain competency standards and expertise with infrequent IV chemotherapy administration. A review of the literature was conducted to identify best practices in competence and confidence in nursing IV chemotherapy administration. A root cause analysis was conducted to discover factors contributing to low levels of competency and confidence in IV chemotherapy administration. Comparisons were made between the standards, guidelines, and policies, and themes were analyzed. Solutions were identified and prioritized. A protocol utilizing just-in-time training was developed along with an implementation plan and an evaluation plan. Just-in-time training utilizes checklists, demonstration, peer review feedback, and self-assessment as a measure of competence and confidence assessment. Feedback about the protocol, implementation plan, and evaluation plan was solicited from a key administrator and stakeholders. The Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) is well suited to implement this protocol due to their ability to integrate care with an interdisciplinary team to identify, develop, implement, and evaluate care practices.

National and state standards now emphasize statistics concepts throughout high school and there is a growing motivation to shift from a traditional formula-based style of teaching statistics to a more data-oriented approach emphasizing conceptual understanding and statistical literacy. To implement this approach in the classroom, it is necessary to integrate technology into the teaching of statistics. However, many in-service high school mathematics teachers are not familiar with this process, and statistics is still a relatively new subject for most. This discrepancy highlights the need to help foster and develop in-service high school mathematics teachers' ability to effectively use technology when teaching statistics. The goal of this study was to investigate how specially annotated lesson plans influence and guide in-service high school mathematics teachers' use of technology when teaching statistical concepts. I developed a completely randomized block experiment, using quantitative and qualitative measurements and methods of analysis. High school mathematics teachers were randomly assigned to receive an annotated or non-annotated statistics unit that included technology-based activities; four lessons were observed. The results of this study demonstrated how the process of helping teachers effectively use technology in the instruction of statistics is not straightforward; there was a large amount of variation in how teachers integrated technology and no consistent differences between the annotated and non-annotated group in this regard. All teachers, regardless of received unit, integrated technology more effectively when they were provided with a technology-based activity employing simulation. Teachers' integration of technology was most influenced by their awareness of the use of inquiry.

A new flavor of MA, focused on averaging partial regression coefficients over multiple models, has gained traction in fields such as Ecology, Biology, and Political Science, with motivation stemming from the concern that inferences based on a single model are too 'naive' (i.e., do not fairly reflect sources of substantial uncertainty). However, coefficients appearing in multiple models do not necessarily hold the same interpretation across models, and averaging over them has the potential to result in inferences that are difficult to interpret. A gap exists between the theoretical development of MA and its current use in practice, potentially leaving well-intentioned researchers with unclear inferences, or difficulties justifying decisions to use (or not use) MA. Furthermore, it is questionable whether the perceived benefit of accounting for an additional source of uncertainty is realized in terms of increased variance for quantities of interest. In this work, we revisit relevant foundations of regression modeling, suggest more explicit notation and graphical tools, and discuss how individual model results are combined to obtain a MA result, with the goal of helping researchers make informed decisions about MA. We present a new package for R Statistical Software providing plotting functions for visualizing components going into the MA posterior distribution. This package is meant to be used to assess the implicit assumptions made by using MA for regression coefficients, complete with guidelines for use and examples. We also design and conduct a simulation study to investigate how the variance for a partial regression coefficient of interest is different for three different approaches used within multimodel inference (MA using all models, MA using a subset of models, and conditioning inferences on one model). We assess whether the perceived benefit of accounting for model uncertainty is actually realized when more models are used for final inference, with the goal of helping researches weigh tradeoffs between using variants of MA in place of one well thought out model.

In systems containing very small metal particles, smaller particles shrink and disappear as they grow into larger particles in a process referred to as coarsening. Coarsening causes irreversible degradation in a number of important systems including automotive catalytic converters and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) through a loss of catalyst (metal) surface area. This phenomenon is exemplified by nickel metal catalyst that is supported on ytrria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which represents a materials system critical to the function of SOFCs. It has been demonstrated that additions of aluminum titanate (ALT) to the Ni-YSZ system with subsequent thermal treatment can act to stabilize the geometry of Ni on YSZ. In demonstration SOFCs, ALT has increased the time required for the first 10% of degradation by a factor of 115. This work has sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which ALT imparts increased stability. The work contained here demonstrates that ALT easily decomposes to Al 2O 3 and TiO 2. During thermal treatment, the alumina reacts with NiO to form nickel aluminate and the titania interacts with the YSZ where it can form Zr 5Ti 7O 24 -- a mixed ion electron conducting phase. In this way, the Al and Ti components of ALT have been determined to act independently where alumina appears to be dominant in microstructural stabilization. During cell operation, the nickel aluminate decomposes to nickel metal decorated with alumina nano-particulate. This geometry forms the basis of 'diffusion caging' as a stabilization mechanism which is the subject of Chapter 8. The role of titania appears to be less important except when processing occurs in a way that facilitates formation of the MIEC phase. However, Ni-YSZ cermets have also shown a strength enhancement when doped with ALT. This strength enhancement is likely due to the influence of titania (Chapter 7). Future work has the potential to extend concepts discussed here to a number of high temperature catalytic systems.

An area that has not been significantly explored is the affect that zeolite flexibility may have on adsorption capacities. In order to explore this, a flow system was built and assembled, and the system performance was verified by replicating literature ZSM-5/isobutane, ZSM-5/n-hexane, and SAPO-34/methanol adsorption isotherms. Different packing schemes (powders, mixtures, pellets) were studied and corresponding adsorption capacities were evaluated for accuracy and precision. It was found that zeolite powder pressed into pellets led to the lowest deviation from literature values and that larger crystal sizes may also lead to more accurate values. While further investigation into packing methods is recommended, the relatively accurate adsorption capacities that were acquired suggests that the established flow system has been built and calibrated correctly, and that further adsorption experiments probing the flexibility of the zeolite structure can begin.

The social studies classroom is changing from pedagogy driven by textbook memorization to one that embraces a more authentic understanding of how history works. This change is accelerating due to new technologies and available primary sources on the Internet. This qualitative study questioned professionals in the field and resulted in four themes: Criteria for Effective Sources, Points of Access for Appropriate Source Material, Challenges Encountered in Finding Appropriate Sources, and Planning Lessons Using Sources. 'Criteria for Effective Sources' centers on what makes primary sources useful in the classroom. The 'Points of Access for Appropriate Source Material' theme describes how accessible primary sources are. The 'Challenges Encountered in Finding Appropriate Sources' theme describes why planning is time consuming. Finally, the 'Planning Lessons Using Sources' theme describes how teachers use sources in their lesson planning process. In essence, primary sources are available, but teachers need time to find and modify those sources to fit their instruction. Better website designs that look at efficiently presenting material on websites, as well as more focused professional development concerning the implementation of sources, could solve some of the challenges social studies teachers face.

The elastic stress is modeled using a numeric stress tensor symmetry preserving scheme that is based on the numeric solution to the Lie derivative and its equivalent counterpart in the form of a symmetric matrix Riccati differential equation (SMRDE). In addition, a coupled advection equation (AE) is applied to the biofilm volume fraction. Solutions to the NSE and AE are found by applying the finite element method (FEM) to the Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM). The ELM is solved by first determining the 'characteristic foot' for each Gaussian quadrature point and node point in the mesh. The advection equation is solved using a modified Galerkin Least Squares (GLS) method. Computations are made using the Trilinos iterative sparse matrix solver library called AztexOO which has built in matrix preconditioners and support for parallel processing. The resulting model is used to predict the deformation of a biofilm in a 2D channel. In addition, the accompanying distribution of the pressure and stresses over the evolving velocity field is presented.

As ammonium is the renewable form of nitrogen produced during anaerobic digestion and one of the main nitrogen sources associated with wastewater, experiments focused on the optimization of growth and lipid production when grown on ammonium were evaluated. Scenedesmus sp. 131 and Kirchneriella sp. 92 were grown in a 14:10 light/dark cycle on ammonium, nitrate or urea in the presence of 5% CO 2 and ammonium and nitrate in the presence of air. Growth on nitrate and urea showed similar growth rates, and provided knowledge on the target growth rate for optimizing growth on ammonium. Results showed the pH decreased during exponential growth on ammonium in both 5% CO 2 and air, causing chlorophyll degradation. Growth on nitrate and air increased the pH of the medium and produced an increase in Nile Red fluorescence and biofuel potential for strain 131, but not for strain 92. Biological buffers were implemented to counteract the change in pH to prevent growth inhibition. Cultures were grown on 5% CO 2 or air, which showed that increased levels of CO 2 are required for increased growth, biofuel potential, and ammonium utilization. This increased the growth rates from 0.26 d -Â¹ to 1.04 d -Â¹ for strain 131 and 0.45 d -Â¹ to 1.31 d -Â¹ for strain 92. pH-controllers using 0.1 M KOH were used in experiments with 5% CO 2 with the understanding that buffers are limited to lab scale experiments and pH control would bridge the gap to industrial processes. The growth rate while utilizing pH-controllers showed similar growth rates to buffered experiments. Growth on nitrate, urea, and buffered ammonium with 5% CO 2 showed an increase in the biofuel potential for strain 92 in comparison to growth with air. Strain 131 had a decrease in biofuel potential when grown on ammonium compared to growth on nitrate or urea. Both strains showed increased levels of CO 2 is required to increase biofuel productivity.

With unlimited time, we lose the beauty of the human experience. The same way an immortal cell becomes cancer, an immortal human loses their humanity. Things seem to matter more the less time we have. One's emotional state affects one's perception of time and leads to a heightened awareness that extends even to the body. Most of us focus too much on the past or worry too much about the future; we lose time because we fail to exist deeply in the present moment. Through my research on biological time and the human condition, painting, and personal experience, I delve into the themes of life and mortality with emphasis on time and identity coupled with organic cells and DNA sequences. I hope that my art inspires others to consider the heavy themes that often motivate my art such as the imminence of death, and with the knowledge of that reality, using the time you are given to the fullest.

We identify two places where such a balance is present for researchers: variable selection and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. An easily identifiable source of cost in science occurs when taking measurements. Researchers measure variables to estimate another quantity based on a model. When model building, researchers may have access to a large number of variables to include in the model and may consider using a subset of the variables so that future uses of the model need only measure this subset rather than all variables. The researchers are incentivized to proceed in this manner if some variables are prohibitively expensive to measure for future uses of the model. In this research, we present a new algorithm for cost-considerate variable selection in linear modeling when confronted with this problem. Since overfitting may be a danger when many variables at the disposal of the researcher, we build on the LARS and Lasso algorithms to perform cost-based variable selection in concert with model regularization. In MCMC sampling for Bayesian statistics, the cost-benefit trade-off is unavoidable. Researchers sampling from a posterior distribution must run a sampler for some number of iterations before finally stopping the sampler to make inference on the finite number of samples drawn. In this situation, the cost to be reduced is time to run the sampler while realizing the longer the sampler is run, the better the convergence. Time may not be as tangible a cost as a dollar figure, but increased wait time to perform analyses incurs the cost of running a computer and any negative effects associated with a delay as the researcher waits until the sampler has finished running. In this research, we introduce new convergence assessment tools in a diagnostic and plot. Unlike commonly used convergence diagnostics, these new tools focus explicitly on posterior quantiles and probabilities which are common inferential objectives in Bayesian statistics. Additionally, we introduce equivalence testing to the convergence assessment domain by using it as the framework of the diagnostic.

Teachers who engage in regular writing practice, possess knowledge of English language foundations and grammar, and have a positive attitude about writing will be better prepared to address the challenges of teaching students how to write. This study examined the attitudes and beliefs of seven elementary education majors who were enrolled in one writing?intensive English language arts course during the spring semester in 2016. The participants in this qualitative case study were selected after taking the Writing Apprehension Test (WAT) as part of their coursework. A social constructivism paradigm provided the theoretical framework for this study. Data sources included: a questionnaire, two semi?structured interviews, a writing memories matrix, daily class observations, a focus group, field observer notes, and student work samples and journal entries. The data was analyzed in the context of student as writer and student as future writing teacher. Six themes emerged within the framework of the analysis for both writer and future writing teacher: providing explicit and meaningful feedback; offering choice in writing topics; making writing fun, enjoyable, and possessing an enthusiasm for the subject; providing adequate instruction in writing foundations, skill, and grammar; allowing adequate time for writing practice; and helping students understand the 'why' of writing. This study offers insight into how preservice teachers perceive and practice the writing process, what factors were influential in the development of their attitudes and beliefs, and what role those will play in writing instruction. In addition, this study explores how providing positive experiences with the writing process within the context of the six themes can bolster confidence and skill levels for soon?to?be teachers. Finally, this study concludes with suggestions for how teacher education programs can optimize instruction to remediate and reinforce skills, foster positive experiences with writing, and support future teachers in their journey.

For example, solid oxide fuel cells generate electricity with low emissions from a variety of fuel sources; solid oxide electrolysis cells produce zero-emission H2 fuel; and solid-state DeNO x cells remove NO x gases from diesel exhaust. In order to maintain high conversion efficiencies, these systems typically operate at temperatures > or = 500Â°C. The high operating temperatures, however, accelerate chemical and mechanical cell degradation. To improve device durability, a mechanistic understanding of the surface chemistry occurring at the cell electrodes (anode and cathode) is critical in terms of refining cell design, material selection and operation protocols. The studies presented herein utilized in operando Raman spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical measurements to directly correlate molecular/material changes with device performance in solid oxide cells under various operating conditions. Because excessive carbon accumulation with carbon-based fuels destroys anodes, the first three studies investigated strategies for mitigating carbon accumulation on Ni cermet anodes. Results from the first two studies showed that low amounts of solid carbon stabilized the electrical output and improved performance of solid oxide fuel cells operating with syn-gas (H 2/CO fuel mixture). The third study revealed that infiltrating anodes with Sn or BaO suppressed carbon accumulation with CH 4 fuel and that H 2O was the most effective reforming agent facilitating carbon removal. The last two studies explored how secondary phases formed in traditional solid oxide cell materials doped with metal oxides improve electrochemical performance. Results from the fourth study suggest that the mixed ion-electron conducting Zr 5Ti 7O 24 secondary phase can expand the electrochemically active region and increase electrochemical activity in cermet electrodes. The final study of lanthanum strontium manganite cathodes infiltrated with BaO revealed the reversible decomposition/formation of a Ba 3Mn 2O 8 secondary phase under applied potentials and proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen reduction associated with this compound under polarizing conditions. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that mechanistic information obtained from molecular/material specific techniques coupled with electrochemical measurements can be used to help optimize materials and operating conditions in solid-state electrochemical cells.

No chemical controls for the WSMV vector, the wheat curl mite (WCM, Aceria tosichella Keifer), are approved. Control relies primarily on avoiding a 'green-bridge' of living plant material that can host the disease between seasons. This study aimed to 1) identify chemical treatments for WCM control under conventional and organic systems and clarify misconceptions that treatments, such as sulfur, control WCM and 2) analyze the capacity of 20 grassy species to serve as reservoirs of WSMV and WCM. The effects of insecticides with varying modes of action (carbamate, organophosphate, pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, biological control, oil, ovicide, mite growth inhibitor, and soap) on WCM population growth were tested in the greenhouse. Treatment with the active ingredients aldicarb and chlorpyrifos decreased WCM populations compared to untreated controls (p<0.001 and p<0.001). Field trials were conducted in spring wheat in 2013 and winter wheat in 2013-2014. Similar effects on WSMV spread were not observed in field trials. These trials included ten products consisting of five modes of action: organophosphates, pyrethroid, oil, soap and mite growth inhibitor. Chlorpyrifos was included in the field trials, but no efficacy was seen in 2013 compared to controls under good infection and incidence and infection was low in 2014, therefore we were unable to distinguish any treatment effect. To assess the capacity of 20 grassy species to serve as reservoirs of WSMV and WCM, plants with varying lifespan and origin were grown in the greenhouse and infested with viruliferous WCM. Lifespan had the greatest impact on ability of plants to host WCM (p=0.011) and WSMV (p<0.001). Annual plant species are more likely to host WCM than perennial grasses, with all species hosting WCM. Native and introduced species tested did not differ in ability to host WCM (p=0.735) and WSMV (p=0.096). This study provides evidence of potential for use of active ingredient chlorpyrifos in WCM control, and showed that lifespan is an important determinant of WSMV disease reservoir potential of grassy species.

Part of that process includes developing their Specialized Content Knowledge, defined by Ball, Hill, and Bass (2005) as a deeper understanding of mathematics that allows teachers to explain new ideas, work problems in multiple ways, and analyze student solutions. This study examined the development of Specialized Content Knowledge among secondary mathematics pre-service teachers. Forty-seven pre-service teachers completed a demographic survey and an assessment measuring Specialized Content Knowledge. Twenty-three of those pre-service teachers were then interviewed to further illuminate experiences that influenced their responses on the assessment, and to elaborate on experiences that they identified as helping them develop Specialized Content Knowledge. Qualitative analysis revealed two broad categories aiding in the development of Specialized Content Knowledge: coursework and interactions with learners. Within the category of coursework, pre-service teachers highlighted course components that were also related to interactions with learners, often in a hypothetical way (e.g., analyzing fictional student work). Findings indicate that the development of Specialized Content Knowledge is strongly influenced by interactions with learners, both face to face and hypothetical. These results are discussed along with recommendations for practice and future research.	['high school students', 'algebra', 'mathematics', 'students', 'science', 'teaching', 'persons']

Considering that science relies on public support for continual funding, timely and accurate communication is crucial; however, informing the general public on the latest research, in a relatable narrative, is not the primary function, nor the focus of a scientist. Co-mingling scientific and technical jargon with anecdotal stories, (that are inherently found in narratives), risks a breakdown in communication leading to unintended consequences for both the audience and the scientist. Bridging the gap between specialized sciences and the general public is the de facto local television news organizations. As a primary dispersal source, it is television news that dribbles scientific information across the audience spectrum. While television news still is considered the most trusted source for broadcast information, the internet is competing in a dead heat while other sources, such as newspapers and magazines are being left behind in the dust. Retrieving data anywhere, and at any time, is propelling the emerging trend of multi-platform accessibility and television news will be required to compete with much higher standards of data recitation.

The preponderance of research across a variety of disciplines suggests that cultural consciousness and awareness is strengthened through self-reflection (Axtell, Avery & Westra, 2010; Danielewicz, 2001; Furlong & Wright, 2011; Gay & Kirkland, 2003; Rew, 2014), dialogue about race (Murray-Garcia, Harrell, Garcia, Gizzi, & Simms-Mackey , 2014), and experience within other cultures (Fredericks, 2006; Kozub,2013; Peaz, Allen, Carson & Cooper, 2008; Stone, et.al., 2014). The purpose of this study was to examine nursing students' perceptions of cultural consciousness pertaining to American Indian culture developed during a one-week cultural immersion service learning (CISL) experience. Specifically, The overarching research question central to the focus of this study was: How do nursing students at this university describe their CISL experience? Three sub questions were posed to inform the main research question. An intrinsic single case study design bounded by the students' perceptions of a cultural immersion service learning experience within an American Indian community was used to answer the research questions. Thirty participants were selected from two cohorts of nursing students enrolled in Nursing Care of Children and Family, a required junior-level course participated in a one-week CISL experience. Data included instructor observations and two sets of student reflections. The data were analyzed using the constant-comparative method (Strauss, 1987). Evidence from clinical reflections demonstrated most students wrestled a mismatch between their initial expectations and the reality of the situation, but several weeks afterward two-thirds of the students integrated the CISL experience into a coherent whole in which cultural consciousness emerged in their reflections. The findings from this study suggest that incorporating CISL experiences into undergraduate nursing curricula may facilitate the development of cultural consciousness and the skills needed for culturally competent care in student nurses. Also, there appeared to be a link between students' ability to recognize their societal privilege, the close proximity of healthcare disparities, and cultural consciousness. Additionally, recommendations were provided for developing a CISL experience within an undergraduate nursing program.

This report uses ultrafast transient absorption and other spectroscopic techniques to analyze several components that show potential for this photocatalysis, in particular observing the excited state dynamics of electron separation and recombination. In ruthenium(II) polypyridyl systems, the rate of interligand electron transfer (ILET) was found to change with time, initially behaving as an ultrafast barrierless process, but transforming into a much slower activated process as excess energy is vibrationally released over 100 ps following excitation. The change in ILET rates lead to changes in the population of localized 3 MLCT states distributed among each ligand, which are initially randomized, but favor the lower energy bipyridine ligands at longer times. Three analogous ruthenium complexes were then linked via a triazole bridge to a cobalt(II) polypyridyl center known to catalyze the formation of H 2, observing the electron transfer from ruthenium to cobalt using emission decay signals of the ruthenium complex. The electron transfer decay pathway was slower and relatively minor compared to similar ruthenium(II)-cobalt(II) systems; however, this reduced efficiency can potentially be explained by localizations on peripheral ligands, as well as a possible energy barrier on the 5-position of phenanthroline. Finally, citrate coated CeO 2 nanoparticles displayed ultrafast trapping of holes upon excitation with UV light, forming significantly deeper traps than has been observed in other metal oxides. Transient absorption signals of the excited holes decayed over hundreds of picoseconds, with lifetimes dependent on the pH of the solution, indicating that the trapping sites are influenced by the surface of the nanoparticle. The corresponding electrons appear to form long lived Ce 3+ sites, observable on timescales of minutes. The fate of these Ce 3+ sites is also pH dependent, indicating that CeO 2 may be an effective water-splitting photocatalyst under basic conditions.	['nonmetals', 'hydrogen', 'chemical elements']

A hyperspectral camera is able to capture data ranging in wavelengths from the visible spectrum all the way into the infrared. In this way, it is able to 'see' hundreds of colors, much more than the human eye or any standard camera that typically uses only 3 spectral values (corresponding to the standard red, green, and blue colors). Due to the large amount of data that these cameras can generate at increasingly faster frame rates, conventional computers are not able to perform all the necessary processing in real-time. Because of this limitation, a new system is needed to perform the image processing. This master's thesis is meant to contribute to the development of a smart camera targeted for hyperspectral image processing using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and object sorting with a prototype waterfall system. Through the use of a Hardware Description Language (HDL), a currently used image processing algorithm has been implemented to classify pixels. Additionally, design and test of an architecture for full object classification has been developed for the FPGA. High-speed transceivers are used to move data between multiple FPGA development boards. When paired with a hyperspectral camera and a monochrome line scan camera, this prototype system is capable of scanning objects in freefall and deciding within milliseconds whether or not to keep the object. This decision will dictate the action of air jets to displace unwanted objects. This full system is potentially of interest to small businesses or farms as it will enable farmers to perform their own premium bulk sorting in a cost effective manner.

These Gram-negative, aerobic bacteria are problematic due to their natural resilience to antibiotics and their metabolic versatility. P. aeruginosa can produce a prodigious extracellular matrix. Within this matrix P. aeruginosa can divide and form a multicellular community called a biofilm. Biofilms have become a health concern worldwide, as these communities are highly resistant to antibiotics. This thesis reports the effort to model the wound environment. A chronic wound exudate medium was designed and P. aeruginosa was grown at 33Â°C under low flow in a drip-flow biofilm reactor. Bacterial cells were grown planktonically and in biofilms. Biofilms were treated with the fluoroquinone, ciprofloxacin for 24 hours and transcriptomic and metabolomic data were collected from treated and untreated biofilms and planktonic cells. Cells growing in biofilms demonstrated a shift in in the regulation of their tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid degradation, and siderophore biosynthesis genes as compared to planktonic cells. Ciprofloxacin treatment altered the transcriptomic landscape within the biofilm. Changes were observed in the transcription of DNA repair, prophage, and phenazine biosynthesis genes. An important virulence factor, the type VI secretion system, was also differently regulated in these samples and is likely important for the persistent infection of wounds. From the information collected, target genes have been identified for future gene-knockout and ciprofloxacin susceptibility assays. A reduction in fitness may indicate genes that are relevant drug targets to enhance antibiotic treatment of these resilient communities.

The current study sought to measure the metabolic demands for several Polynesian dances (i.e., Hawaiian hula, Fijian, Maori haka and poi balls, Samoan sasa and slap, Tahitian, and Tongan), and to evaluate possible gender differences in these measures in a group of experienced Polynesian dancers. Thirty participants (13 men and 17 women) were tested through a dance testing protocol, using indirect calorimetry. Metabolic demands were evaluated in units of metabolic equivalent (MET), as well as both aerobic and anaerobic activity energy expenditure (AEE) contributions to total AEE. One sample t-test was used to compare the mean MET values for each cultural dance to the cutoff values (3-MET and 6-MET, respectively) for moderate and vigorous physical activity. Gender differences were examined using independent t-tests. The mean MET values for all, but Maori poi balls dance, were significantly greater than 3.0 METs. The mean MET values for Samoan sasa, Samoan slap and Tahitian were also significantly greater than 6.0 METs. The men's MET values for Hawaiian hula, Samoan sasa, Tongan, Fijian, and Maori haka were all significantly greater (P < 0.001) than the corresponding values for women, while the Tahitian MET values were similar (P = 0.526) between both genders. Aerobic and anaerobic AEE contribute 83.4% and 16.6%, respectively, on average, for Polynesian dances, with Hawaiian hula being the most aerobic (88.7% and 11.3%, respectively) and Samoan slap being the least aerobic (74.2% and 25.8%, respectively). The aerobic AEE for men was significantly greater than that for women for the Hawaiian hula, Samoan sasa, Fijian, Maori haka, and Tongan (P < 0.001), while no significance gender difference was observed in anaerobic AEE (P = 0.087 - 0.989). The present study indicated that the Polynesian dance of various forms met the current PA recommendations, and thus can be used as an appropriate mode of aerobic exercise to increase regular physical activity in the ethnic minorities in Hawaii and the south Pacific for health promotion and disease prevention.

However, throughout the literature the concept of reflection has been ill-defined and shown to be difficult to operationalize in studies. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the literature, this study sought to develop a research based way to operationalize reflection. Once reflection was defined and operationalized, a discourse analysis rubric was designed to identify elements of non reflective and reflective discourse used by participants in an online content-based mentoring and induction professional development program, e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS). The rubric was used to conduct a content analysis of online discourse between novice and experienced science teachers participating in the eMSS program. Coders determined which elements of non reflective and reflective discourse, including levels of discourse, were used by different types of participants in the various online discussion areas of the eMSS program. The results of this study showed a higher percentage of novice science teachers' messages were coded as containing overall higher levels of reflective discourse. This difference was partly attributed to the different roles experienced and novice science teachers have in this program. The different eMSS online discussion areas had varying percentages of messages identified as containing different levels of reflective discourse. Different discussion area curriculums, including types of discussion prompts and methods of facilitation, partly attributed to these differences. This study showed the importance of being intentional in the wording or modeling of what is expected from participants as they compose their messages. This study also showed that eliciting reflective thought processes from program participants depends on a variety of factors and can be contextual. No single factor stood out as essential to consistently encouraging reflective thought processes. Recommendations are made for designing program curriculums and facilitating the type of learning that results in the use of reflective thought by program participants.

The Hardness (Ha) locus consisting of the Puroindoline a and b genes (Pina and Pinb) controls the majority of grain hardness variation. Starch production is a growing end-use of wheat. The first objective of this study was to estimate the differences in starch yield due to natural and transgenically conditioned grain hardness differences. To accomplish this goal, a small scale wet milling protocol was used to characterize the wet milling properties of two independent groups of isogenic materials varying in grain hardness and in Pin expression level. The results of the first study demonstrate that the Ha locus and puroindoline expression are both linked to wet-milling starch yield and that selection for increased Ha function increases starch yield via enhanced separation of starch granules and the protein matrix during wet milling. The lack of Pin allelic diversity is a major factor limiting Ha functional analyses and wheat quality improvement. So the second objective of this study was to create new Ha alleles in the soft white spring cultivar Alpowa using ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The M 2 population was screened to identify new alleles of Pina and Pinb. One hundred and forty eight new Pin alleles, including 68 missense alleles, were identified. F 2 populations for 49 of the new Pin alleles including 43 unique missense ones were developed after crossing each back to non-mutant Alpowa. Grain hardness was then measured on F 2:3 seeds and the impact of each allele on grain hardness was quantified. The tested mutations comprised a range of functionality from neutral to function abolishing mutations. Seed weight and vigor of all mutation lines was restored among all of the F 2 populations. The new alleles have the potential to improve end use properties of soft and hard wheats.

This can be even more of a struggle for students identified with learning disabilities. All students, including those who receive special education services, are required to participate in the regular education science curriculum. In this study specific science strategy interventions were implemented over a six-week treatment period to support students with learning disabilities in the regular science education classroom. The data indicates that with appropriate content interventions, all students participated and engaged in the classroom environment with a greater confidence. In addition to academic engagement, most students saw an increase in their academic achievement in the regular education classroom. In conclusion, the treatment led to an increase in positive attitudes toward the science classroom and in content learning.

Although much effort has been devoted to quantifying how warming alters carbon cycling across diverse ecosystems, less is known about how these changes are linked to the cycling of bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus. In freshwater ecosystems, benthic biofilms (i.e. thin films of algae, bacteria, fungi, and detrital matter) act as biogeochemical hotspots by controlling important fluxes of energy and material. Understanding how biofilms respond to warming is thus critical for predicting responses of coupled elemental cycles in freshwater systems. We developed biofilm communities in experimental streamside channels along a gradient of mean water temperatures (7.5Ã¢â¬â23.6 ÃÂ°C), while closely maintaining natural diel and seasonal temperature variation with a common water and propagule source. Both structural (i.e. biomass, stoichiometry, assemblage structure) and functional (i.e. metabolism, N2-fixation, nutrient uptake) attributes of biofilms were measured on multiple dates to link changes in carbon flow explicitly to the dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus. Temperature had strong positive effects on biofilm biomass (2.8- to 24-fold variation) and net ecosystem productivity (44- to 317-fold variation), despite extremely low concentrations of limiting dissolved nitrogen. Temperature had surprisingly minimal effects on biofilm stoichiometry: carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios were temperature-invariant, while carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratios declined slightly with increasing temperature. Biofilm communities were dominated by cyanobacteria at all temperatures (>91% of total biovolume) and N2-fixation rates increased up to 120-fold between the coldest and warmest treatments. Although ammonium-N uptake increased with temperature (2.8- to 6.8-fold variation), the much higher N2-fixation rates supplied the majority of N to the ecosystem at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate that temperature can alter how carbon is cycled and coupled to nitrogen and phosphorus. The uncoupling of C fixation from dissolved inorganic nitrogen supply produced large unexpected changes in biofilm development, elemental cycling, and likely downstream exports of nutrients and organic matter.

Even fewer can explain the true nature of stereotype threat's disruptive nature on working memory. Based upon the dual process framework of control (Kane & Engle, 2003) we examined whether or not stereotype threat produces its negative effects by creating distraction that debilitates individual's ability to maintain the goal of the task and one's ability to resolve competition between conflicting responses. In Study 1, 187 men engaged in a working memory capacity measure (Ospan) and then engaged in the color Stroop task under mostly congruent list conditions or mostly incongruent list conditions. The Stroop task was described as a test of verbal ability (stereotype threat condition) or not (control). The results demonstrated that stereotype threat disrupts working memory by interfering with an individual's ability to maintain the task goals increasing Stroop error effects, especially for those with lower working memory capacity. Study 2 was designed to replicate Study 1 using a different stereotyped population and to investigate what cognitive control strategy operates while under stereotype threat. Specifically, we examined if stereotype threat increases the use of reactive control strategies whereby individuals do not actively maintain the task goal, make an error that indicates conflict, which in turn reactivates the goal for a short while. In Study 2, 144 women were given the automated version of the Reading Span task to assess working memory capacity, then completed the counting Stroop task under mostly congruent list conditions or mostly incongruent list conditions with item specific congruency manipulated within both lists. The Stroop task was described as a quantitative ability task (stereotype threat condition) or not (control). Overall errors and reaction time were again assessed. In addition, errors and reaction times for mostly congruent items, mostly incongruent items, and item-specific effects were assessed. The results did not provide significant evidence as to what type of control strategy operates under stereotype threat. Implications of how stereotype threat disrupts working memory and how interventions can address these effects are discussed.

Politicians, scientists, and clergymen all responded to the evolving call for reforms. More and more people adopted the view that women were oppressed by a male-centered society, and most women were isolated within the home. Women writers belonged to a small group of women whose voices had cultural weight and they had to negotiate between the demands of their writing and audience and their involvement and interest in the women's movement. At the turn of the century, Sarah Orne Jewett, Zitkala-Å a, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman each had their respective audiences and expectations, and each woman had to balance her writing and her interest in the debate over women's role in society. For each author, three years of her life and work are isolated in order to take an in-depth look at the influences of the women's movement. In order to fully appreciate the complexities affecting the writing and the changes that writers had to face, both privately and publicly, the writers' personal lives, the political atmosphere, and the writing produced are studied. Key questions are asked of each author: How did she respond to reform movements? How did she use her career to influence and change ideas about women in the United States? Spanning from the 1880s into the 1920s, Jewett, Zitkala-Sa, and Gilman each approached their work differently, and their work during this time highlights the complexity and connections of writing, politics, and life.

They are polyphagous and have cryptic habitats. In recent years, increasing wireworm numbers and damage have become a major problem for growers in the Golden Triangle Region of Montana. The control of this pest is very difficult because after the removal of Lindane by US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in 2009, the use of the second generation insecticides have not been able to provide effective control of wireworms. Thus, using insecticides to control wireworms has not been effective at high population levels. Also, little is known about the biology and feeding habit of wireworms. The goal of this study is to evaluate trap crops that can protect the spring wheat by attracting wireworms. First, field trials were conducted at two locations to investigate on the use of peas Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae), lentils Lens culinaris L. (Fabaceae), canola/rapeseed Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae), corn/maize Zea mays L. (Poaceae), durum Triticum durum Desf. (Poaceae) and barley Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae) as traps intercropped with spring wheat Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae). The efficacy of trap cropping was determined by damage assessment in wheat plants along 1m transects and by counting wireworm populations on wheat and trap crop rows of a plot. Secondly, the effect of intercrop spacing on plant damage and the number of wireworms was determined for pea and lentil trap crops. To support field trials potted experiments were set up in the shade house to determine wireworm distributions in two-choice assays. Collectively the results from this study showed that pea and lentil trap crops resulted in significantly lower damage in wheat plants and they attracted more numbers of wireworms compared to other crops. Results from shade house trails supported observations from the field trials. An intercropping spacing of 0.5m between pea or lentil and the spring wheat crop produced highest density of spring wheat plants. The results from these experiments will add to the basic understanding of trap cropping for wireworms control.

Cultivation strategies are a pivotal component of achieving high biomass yield. Open outdoor pond systems are currently the most economically viable method for large-scale algae cultivation due to less energy for maintenance than closed systems. However, open pond cultivation is subject to microbial colonization, sometimes negatively impacting the algal crop. Thus, large-scale production is hindered by gaps in our fundamental understanding of microbial interactions and ecology. The following research aims to explore the interplay between cultivation methods, nutrient availability, community composition, lipid metabolism, and system ecology and identify cost effective concepts for algal lipid production. Using alkalinity to limit microbial colonization of an open system is investigated in Chapter 2 in which a monoculture of Chlorella vulgaris was successfully cultivated. A putative relationship with a Pseudomonas sp. was identified in which the exchange of key metabolites could have enhanced algal growth and limited contamination. Such interactions may minimize the need for pesticides and fertilizer subsequently reducing pollution and operating costs. Findings suggested that potentially beneficial algal-bacterial relationships occurring in alkaline conditions supported a productive and stable monoculture. Alkalinity, in addition to nutrient abundance, is further explored in a natural freshwater terminal lake system, presented in Chapter 3. Lake eutrophication coupled with temperature increases led to a toxic cyanobacterial bloom that reduced overall eukaryotic diversity. Insight gained on the interplay between alkalinity, nutrients, and community dynamics from this natural system was then applied to a series of artificial wastewater lagoons Chapter 4. Elevated lipid (g/L) was observed in this system partially facilitated by increased water residence time in the lagoons and elevated nitrogen availability. Differing alga community composition were observed during periods of elevated lipid in addition to higher biomass (cells/mL) suggesting that higher lipid volumes were the result of high biomass concentration and not necessarily the lipid productivity of specific alga taxa. The research presented utilizes traditional ecologic concepts like diversity and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of community interactions helping to minimize cost, reduce pollution, and ultimately contribute to the realization of viable biodiesel.

In order for our public health system to protect us from new threats, we need to be adequately informed. Much of the information the public receives about infectious diseases comes from visual sources. With a shift away from broadcast media to internet-based sources, story becomes emphasized over accuracy. This sensationalizes diseases, leading to the spread of misinformation and the amplification of stigmas. Accurate portrayals of diseases are crucial to society's ability to fight them, and as content creators, filmmakers have a responsibility to limit the spread of misinformation. In this paper, I explore the effect sensationalism and stigma have on the perpetuation of disease outbreaks and the importance of accuracy and transparency in our media, including the news, Hollywood film, and documentary.

The fate of chromium in the environment is influenced by a number of factors including the microbial processes and the interactions with soil constituents such as carbon sources, iron minerals and electron shuttling compounds. The overall goals of these studies were to isolate and characterize microorganisms that may play a role in the fate of chromium in soil systems, identify the microbial community associated with a simulated low-level waste site and determine the role carbon source, iron minerals and electron shuttles play on Cr(VI) toxicity and reduction by Arthrobacter spp. and Cellulomonas sp. strain ES6. Three strategies for isolating potential cellulose-degrading isolates (direct isolation on agar plates, liquid enrichments and soil laden continuous flow columns) were implemented through which thirteen isolates were obtained. Clone library, PhyloChip and quantitative PCR analyses of the bacterial community within a simulated low-level waste site at the Idaho National Laboratory suggested that the presence of cellulosic waste influenced the bacterial community structure with soil depth at the site. The influence of potential cellulose degradation products as carbon sources on Cr(VI) toxicity and reduction by Arthrobacter sp. isolate EF01 and A. aurescens TC1 was assessed through bench-scale studies. Results indicated that Cr(VI) toxicity to both Arthrobacter spp. was tied to carbon metabolism. Additional studies with Cellulomonas sp. strain ES6 demonstrated that Cr(VI) reduction by this organism was also influenced by carbon source as well as by the addition of electron shuttles and iron minerals. Overall, the results of this dissertation provide insight into the potential interactions between microorganisms, soil constituents and chromium in situ.

Four Montana high schools were selected for this study based upon students above average composite ACT scores and graduation rates for two consecutive years. The third criterion was that each school's principal had to have been in that leadership position longer than four years. Each school completed Goddard and Hoy's Collective Efficacy Scale (2003) to ascertain the level of the teaching staff's collective efficacy and provide descriptive data. The principal and a teacher focus group from each school were then interviewed separately. From the data analysis, three themes emerged across all four schools. First, principals had developed 'situational awareness' to effectively manage their schools. Second, principals had well established and effective formal and informal channels of communication. Third, principals had a continuous school improvement process in place to make improvements. Principals have a key role to play in the development of CTE as well as the implementation of HRO principles in their schools to create a high-performing school. The results of this study can provide new insights on how principals develop collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and utilize the five high reliability organization principals to create a high-performing high school in rural Montana.

As filmmakers apply terrestrial logic to aquatic environments fishermen are subject to the film's cultural and personal perspectives. Because of this fishermen are portrayed as scientists, necessary to understanding aquatic sea life; stewards, necessary for protecting and maintaining the ocean; and predators, preying on the ocean's resources. Although films define and redefine anglers into different political spheres, fishermen are important to understanding the ocean. They are an invaluable resource for first-hand contact with aquatic environments. Utilizing anglers to construct the filmmaker's argument will only benefit films trying to describe the ocean as a space connected to and defined apart from terrestrial beings. I use my film, 43 and 80, as an example of a film that allows its fishermen to be the primary source of information about one species of marine life, namely pacific halibut. Because of their proximity and reliance on the fishing industry, I portray the fishermen of 43 and 80 as instrumental to understanding the need for halibut conservation and the regulations surrounding the pacific halibut industry.

This thesis explores the potential of one such tool, meteoric 10 Be. The delivery of meteoric 10 Be to the surface varies with precipitation and its adsorption to sediment has proven useful in studies of erosion. These characteristics indicate that meteoric 10 Be in lake sediments varies under changing climate and changing sediment influx, making it a potential recorder of past climate and landscape processes. To examine the controls on meteoric 10 Be concentrations in lake sediments, we develop a model that predicts concentrations of 10 Be in lake sediments as a function of atmospheric flux, sedimentation rate, and terrigenous input. The model was applied to two published datasets of 10 Be profiles in lake sediments from different settings to assess the sensitivity of individual controls on 10 Be concentration. Results show that while a variety of environmental conditions influence 10 Be in lake sediments, these can be quantified with surprisingly simple parameters. Assessment of the relative importance of model parameters requires the comparison of 10 Be concentrations in well-dated lake cores to independent paleoenvironmental proxies. We further validate this model and explore the application of meteoric 10 Be in lake archives, by exploring a new system, Blacktail Pond in Northern Yellowstone, for which a wealth of paleoenvironmental data exists. We present new meteoric 10 Be data in the core, and compare to model predictions based on sedimentation rates of both autochthous and allocthonous sediments and changes in the flux of meteoric 10 Be with precipitation. Surprisingly, patterns of measured 10 Be concentrations in Blacktail Pond sediments show little relationship to predicted concentrations, despite being of similar magnitude. Based on this analysis, we suggest that small lake systems may be most problematic for 10 Be analyses as they are most sensitive to changing 10 Be concentrations relative to changes in model parameters. This work provides a new quantitative framework to assess the control of sedimentation rates, inputs of allocthonous sediments, and hydroclimate in determining the 10 Be concentrations measured in lake sediments, and highlights the potential and limitations of meteoric 10 Be in quantifying past environmental changes.

Teachers must assume varied roles in highly complex environments that fall under high accountability and demand, marking it as a stressful occupation. Particularly vulnerable are those learning to teach; they must be prepared for the realities of today's classroom, understanding the multiple roles that will be required of them. They experience a role-reversal as they transform from student to teacher. In order to negotiate this shift in perspective they must possess both an optimistic belief in their competence and ability to cope with the demands. This phenomenological study examined the experiences of secondary education pre-service teachers as they transformed from student to teacher. It captured a sense of their general and personal preconceptions regarding stress and coping, their experiences of stress and coping as they learned to teach, and the supports and resources that they perceived as preparing them to enter the teaching profession, particularly with teacher self-efficacy. The development and implementation of a stress management workshop served a dual purpose to provide a stage to build teacher self-efficacy. Three theories provided a foundation for the conceptual framework: Karasek's (1979) Job Demand-Control-Support Theory, Mezirow's (1999) Transformational Learning Theory, and Bandura's (1977) Self-Efficacy Theory. The participants were eight secondary English teacher candidates. Qualitative interviews and data collected from the workshop highlighted transformational profiles analyzed to capture the transformation. The results indicated emerging themes of trust, connection, purpose and balance as important tenets to cultivate teacher self-efficacy. These tenets were promoted through earlier and extended time in field experiences, social support through networks and learning communities, critical reflective activities and self-care initiatives. The stress management workshop provided a mediating support. The significance of this study may inform those who prepare teaching professional about proactive ways to build teacher self-efficacy and promote wellness among teacher candidates.

However, there are unique challenges to successful implementation of MHK devices. Material selection and characterization are crucial steps in the design process as the marine environment can be extremely detrimental to many materials systems. Epoxy-fiberglass composites, the premier material in wind turbine blades are being studied for use in MHK due to desirable price and durability. Preliminary research has shown a significant drop in ultimate strength due to moisture absorption in unidirectional laminates. This research extends these studies by exploring these effects on balanced and unbalanced off-axis fiber angles for a common epoxy-fiberglass material system. Ply by ply analysis is completed to explore the efficacy of a strength reduction prediction method for off-axis laminates. It also extends the study to include acoustic emission analysis to further investigate the material degradation at a micromechanical level.

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) skin infections are becoming increasingly common and are the result of nearly 20,000 deaths in the United States each year. Although smoking has been linked to numerous infections including those that occur post-operatively, no one has ever linked the exposure to cigarette smoke to these types of infections. This study intended to examine the relationship between the two. Data was collected from patients in an Emergency Department with a history of non-surgical MRSA skin infections to determine what percentage of them smoked, smoked at the time of their infection or were exposed to smoke on a regular basis. Because of a small sample size and a flawed study design, a statistical analysis was not possible. However, it was discovered that over 63% of those with the infection were exposed to cigarette smoke in one form or another. The remaining 37% were nonsmokers or were not exposed to smoke on a regular basis. This indicates there may possibly be a link between the two but more research is needed in the area in order to establish a relationship.

The original premise was that some students are strong in some intelligences and weak in others. Each student started by learning the content in the areas they were strong in, and then using that knowledge to help them overcome the more challenging concepts. They then worked together with students from all of the intelligence strengths to show a greater understanding of the content and scientific skills. The data was collected using a combination of pre and posttests, surveys, observations, and concept maps as a part of individual student interviews. The results indicate that this approach has its merits but will need refinement to be implemented into the entire curriculum. Differentiation with respect to multiple intelligence theory appears to cause an increase in student understanding, attitude and motivation.

The American preference for the exotic finds its roots in the early African hunting films of Cherry Kearton, John Hemment, and Martin Johnson. These films became manifestations of the Pristine, a conceptual realm of untouched wildness filled with aesthetically-pleasing megafauna. Since then, visions of the Pristine, through the exotic wildlife and landscape, have remained popular in American broadcast viewing, as seen in Animal Planet's programming. Exotic wildlife broadcast film encourages viewers to engage in the roles of tourist, refugee, and conservationist. These roles, in turn, foster an understanding of nature that is dominated by seemingly plentiful megafauna, disconnected from humans and valued through a nature-importing model. The challenge in viewing domestic wildlife in broadcast film is that Americans cannot engage in the tourist role, one that highly values novelty and exceptionalism. In addition, Americans have become increasingly urbanized and separate from their natural surroundings. This separation between Americans and domestic wildlife may foster negative attitudes toward and misinformation of domestic fauna. Despite small steps in presenting domestic wildlife in Animal Planet programming, the prevalence of exotic-focused wildlife film has done little to bridge the gap between Americans and domestic wildlife. Filmmakers should reconsider the appeal of exotic wildlife (novelty and rarity) in order to foster interest in the vast array of generally unknown domestic wildlife. In a way films can encourage American viewers to become ""tourists"" to their own country's wildlife and foster the same positive values Americans hold for exotic fauna."

This dissertation work demonstrates the utility of protein cages including their use as therapeutic and imaging agent delivery systems. Protein cage architectures have clearly demarcated exterior, interior, and interface surfaces and their structures are known to atomic level resolution. This information is essential for the engineering of functionalized nanoparticles via both chemical and genetic modification. In the process of tailoring protein cage architectures for particular applications, fundamental information about the architectures themselves is gained. The present work describes endeavors toward the use of three different protein cage architectures, the Cowpea chlorotic mottle viral capsid (CCMV), a small heat shock protein (Hsp) architecture originally isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, and human H-chain ferritin, as cell-specific therapeutic and imaging agent delivery systems. Each protein cage is roughly spherical, but their sizes differ; CCMV is 28 nm in diameter, whereas Hsp and HFn are 12 nm in diameter. The advantages and disadvantages of all three architectures are described. Wild type and genetic variants of the Hsp, HFn, and CCMV cages were reacted for the site specific attachment of organic molecules such as therapeutic agents, imaging agents, and targeting ligands. Inorganic chemical modification of the cages was employed for the formation iron oxide nanoparticles which are potentially useful as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Toward the development of the Hsp platform for therapeutic delivery, the antitumor agent doxorubicin was covalently bound on the interior of the cage and selectively released via a pH dependant trigger. In addition, mammalian cell-specific targeting was imparted to the Hsp and HFn cages by both genetic and chemical strategies. Biodistribution studies of Hsp and CCMV were performed in naÃ¯ve and pre-immunized mice and Hsp cages localized to human tumor xenografts in mice. Together these results demonstrate the utility of the protein cages as robust nanoscale platforms for the synthesis of both soft (organic) and hard (inorganic) materials.

In addition, ED nurses see a myriad of injuries to the skin and bones that requires visual assessment. By performing a routine skin examination on patients, ED nurses can significantly affect a reduction in the detection of advanced stage melanoma and, thus, increase survival rates.

This new word is Haptiacle, which is formed by combining two words Haptic and Spectacle. Haptiacle: A hands on event or performance, designed for viewer transformation that is visually striking that can be experienced, especially something of a remarkable or impressive nature accessible to all. This body of work is installed to create the environment as a Haptiacle. First, the work demonstrates the spectacle due to the unusual transformation of the sterile gallery, combined with the entertaining public display of the work. Secondly it is also a haptic because of the hands on connection with work; in this case the ceramic bowling balls. This Haptiacle is the first of its kind, never performed before until now. This is the new Americana approach of ceramics, art, and the exhibition space. After the installation of this show I have relinquished the control to the viewers for a full Haptiacle experience with the complete elimination of the confinement of the gallery walls. This show exist everywhere that you have Internet and fully accessible to all around the world to provide an abundance of memories, and to provoke the imagination. Plus raise awareness of ritual involving the handling, breaking and performance aspect of ceramic objects.

While many studies have explored the recognition of individual instruments, the field has only recently begun to explore the more difficult multi-label classification problem of identifying the musical instruments present in mixtures. This dissertation presents a novel method for feature extraction in multi-label instrument classification and makes important contributions to the domain of instrument classification and to the research area of multi-label classification. In this work, we consider the largest collection of instrument samples in the literature. We examine 13 musical instruments common to four datasets. We consider multiple performers, multiple dynamic levels, and all possible musical pitches within the range of the instruments. To the area of multi-label classification, we introduce a binary-relevance feature extraction scheme to couple with the common binary-relevance classification paradigm, allowing selection of features unique to each class label. We present a data-driven approach to learning areas of spectral prominence for each instrument and use these locations to guide our binary-relevance feature extraction. We use this approach to estimate source separation of our polyphonic mixtures. We contribute the largest study of single- and multi-label classification in musical instrument literature and demonstrate that our results track with or improve upon the results of comparable approaches. In our solo instrument classification experiments, we provide the seminal use of Bayesian classifiers in the domain and demonstrate the utility of conditional dependencies between frequency- and time-based features for the instrument classification problem. For multi-label instrument classification, we explore the question of dataset bias in a cross-validation study controlled for dataset independence. Additionally, we present a comprehensive cross-dataset study and demonstrate the generalizability of our approach. We consider the difficulty of the multi-label problem with regards to label density and cardinality and present experiments with a reduced label set, comparable to many studies in the literature, and demonstrate the efficacy of our system on this easier problem. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of multi-label evaluation measures.

These studies address three general questions: 1) Solvent structure at solid/liquid interfaces; 2) Solute adsorption to chemically tailored solid and liquid interfaces; and 3) Partitioning of binary solvents at solid/liquid and solid/vapor interfaces. 1) Solvent structure at solid/liquid interfaces. Vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) was used to study the interfacial organization of different alkanes and alcohols at the silica/liquid interface. Results showed that solvent organization depended sensitively on both interactions with the interface and on the solvent's molecular structure. Silica/methanol and silica/ethanol interfaces were also compared in order to determine why ethanol gives a VSFG spectrum but methanol does not. 2) Solute adsorption to chemically tailored interfaces. VSFS and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize and analyze the effectiveness of silica substrates functionalized specifically to promote adsorption of organic analytes in aqueous solutions through catch and release chemistry. VSFS has also been used to study cooperative adsorption at aqueous/vapor interfaces to explore how insoluble surfactants can increase near-surface concentrations of soluble species. 3) Binary solvent partitioning at solid/liquid and solid/vapor interfaces. VSFS was used to study molecular organization at silica/binary solvent interfaces where the binary solvent consisted of acetonitrile and methanol in varying mole fractions. The vibrational spectra indicated that while methanol adsorbed ideally at the silica/vapor interface, acetonitrile accumulated in excess relative to the vapor phase composition. At the silica/liquid interface, methanol appeared to remain strongly associated with the surface until an acetonitrile mole fraction of 0.85 was reached. At higher mole fractions, interfacial acetonitrile adopts an antiparallel bilayer organization. This binary mixture was also compared to various other binary mixtures at the silica/vapor and silica/liquid interfaces.

TB disease is caused by bacterium called Mycobacterim tuberculosis, which is a facultative intracellular parasite that is transferred through the air from one person to another in close contact. A six month course of four antimicrobial drugs is the only current treatment for drug-sensitive TB. However, multi-drug resistance TB is difficult to treat. Phage therapy might be one answer as a treatment for multi-drug resistance TB. In order for phage therapy to have a chance against TB, the immune system of bacteria, known as CRISPR/Cas needs to be inhibited. Our lab has taken a structural and biochemical approach to try to understand the CRISPR/Cas system in M. tuberculosis. We have cloned, expressed, and purified individual Csm proteins from the H37Rv M. tuberculosis strain. Two Csm protein, Csm3 and Csm5 were successfully purified to homogeneity in yields suitable for structure and biochemical studies. While to date, each has failed to produce crystals, the ability to the express and purify each of these proteins will allow further biochemical characterization of Csm3 and Csm5.

Traditionally, viral metagenomic studies provide information about viral gene content, but rarely provide knowledge about virion morphology and or cellular host identity. This thesis describes research to utilize culture-independent methods to identify and to characterize two new archaeal viruses starting with viral metagenomic sequences. The first virus, Acidianus tailed spindle virus (ATSV), was initially identified by bioinformatic analysis of viral metagenomic datasets from a high temperature (80Â° C) acidic (pH 2) hot spring located in Yellowstone National Park, USA. ATSV was purified and characterized directly from environmental samples without dependency on culturing. Characterization included identification of the large tailed spindle shape virion morphology, determination of the complete 70.8 kbp circular ds DNA viral genome content, and identification of its cellular host. The host of ATSV, Acidianus hospitalis, was determined using CRISPR/Cas identification and CARD-FISH, and was confirmed by culturing. Additional characterization of ATSV included solving the structure of the major coat protein (MCP) by X-ray crystallography. The ATSV MCP reveals a decorated right-handed four helix bundle. The MCP is packed into the crystal as a four-start superhelix, for which the interfaces show biologically relevant interactions, indicating that ATSV might assemble using a multi-start helix. CryoEM images of ATSV show striations extending across the virion, supporting an assembly model in which long protein strands form the spindle virion structure. This is the first known model of spindle virus assembly. Culture-independent methods developed for ATSV purification and characterization were applied to a second virus, a pleomorphic particle found in high abundance in the CHAS viral fraction. Using mass spectrometry identification, viral metagenomics, deep sequencing, and host identification, a full virus genome and a host were linked to the virus particle, named Stygiolobus pleomorphic virus (SPV). SPV most likely represents a new virus family, with a unique particle morphology and gene content. Taken together, the results reported in this thesis provide an expanded pathway for the discovery, isolation and characterization of new viruses using culture-independent approaches.

Food options in the retail environment are important, complex factor in dietary choices that can either be promotional or preventative of healthy behaviors. At the same time, breastfeeding is considered a top public health priority due to its unparalleled, favorable health outcomes that impact infants, mothers, and entire communities. For this reason the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding continue for at least one year after birth. There are multiple practical and social barriers to breastfeeding for women that support the need for appropriate formula varieties in the food environment to support infant nutrition. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) promotes breastfeeding as an optimal source of nutrition for infants, and offers breastfeeding incentives for enrolled mother-infant pairs resulting in higher assistance allotment for foods, or formula supplements for non-breastfed infants. This research includes a systematic review of literature conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines in order to identify factors associated with increased likelihood of breastfeeding among WIC participants. This research also introduces a measure adapted from the Nutrition Environment Measure in Stores (NEMS-S) formulated to capture infant feeding support in the food environment. The Infant Feeding Resource Survey (IFRS) captures WIC-supported brand formulas and alternate brand varieties in addition to resource support necessary for breast or formula feeding in store settings. Review findings indicate sociodemographic characteristics, environmental and media support, government policy, intent to breastfeed, attitudes toward breastfeeding, social support, and time exposed to WIC program are correlated with increasing breastfeeding rates within this population. Application of the IFRS indicated a reduced variety of infant feeding resource options in more rural locations in Montana. Data provides valuable information in extension of the state of the science of food environment focused research.

To achieve this purpose, an in-depth literature review was conducted to collate a time line of events surrounding OFSP introduction. Primary research was carried out to explore remaining challenges associated with improving adoption and retention levels and involved interviews and focus groups with 95 participants including farmers, consumers, and market vendors of OFSP. Field research was carried out in three provinces of Mozambique over a nine month period in 2015 with funding provided by the Fulbright US student program. Interviews and focus groups were translated and transcribed verbatim by the researcher and were analyzed by a team of authors to understand the site-specific factors affecting farmer willingness and ability to procure, preserve, cultivate, and distribute OFSP varieties, with a particular interest in the retention of planting material over time. Diffusion of Innovations Theory was utilized in the research design, analysis, and reporting. Results indicate that a wide variety of factors influence adoption and retention of orange-fleshed sweet potato, including: awareness of health benefits; organoleptic qualities and taste preferences; access to planting material; perceived difference in agronomic traits, including pest and drought resistance, time to root maturity, and vine development; dependence on non-government organizations or neighbors for planting material; lack of access to capital for inputs and labor; unstable markets and fluctuating prices; and varying levels of sharing of information and planting material across farmer networks. Future research should focus on mechanisms to increase year-round availability of planting material, improved drought and pest tolerance for OFSP, understanding farmer preference for vine and leaf development, renewed emphasis on nutritional benefits and cooking methods for sweet potato derivatives, gender dynamics of sweet potato commercialization, and farmer training on improved agricultural techniques that highlights the agronomic similarities between OFSP and WFSP to avoid perceptions that OFSP production is more labor intensive.

The predictive capability of measured independent variables to anticipate first to second year attrition of freshmen in the College of Agriculture (COA) at Montana State University (MSU) was tested. The potential for using the Academic Attributional Style Questionnaire (AASQ) to identify COA students most susceptible to attrition during their freshmen year at MSU was ascertained. Freshmen took the CSI during summer orientation and the AASQ was administered to students in four COA classes. A cohort group of COA full-time, first-time freshmen that had taken both the CSI and AASQ was established and tracked from the fall of 2004 through the fall of 2005. Retention was defined as enrollment in the COA for a second fall semester. The majority of the cohort group was female, white/Caucasian, had been enrolled in a high school agriculture class, graduated from high schools with enrollments less than 400 students, had been involved in 4-H or FFA, and intended to seek a graduate level degree. Mothers were more highly educated than fathers. Most students planned to work while in college. The only independent variable significantly correlated with retention was second semester cumulative GPA. The combination of second semester cumulative GPA, plans to work, degree sought, and high school agriculture class enrollment was able to predict 19 percent of the variance in retention rates. However, contrary to the literature, high school agriculture class enrollment was negatively correlated with retention. The majority of students demonstrated neither optimistic nor pessimistic explanatory styles. Significant relationships were shown between explanatory style and high school GPA, study habits, sociability, and openness to financial guidance. The AASQ demonstrated little value for recognizing students in the cohort susceptible to attrition from the COA, but did indicate some usefulness for use as an advising tool.

Unfortunately, fluorescent proteins cannot be used to track small metabolites in vivo. The purpose of the work described herein was to create novel red-shifted RNA aptamer based probes for use in molecular imaging. All potential dyes were prescreened using molecular modeling and only the dyes that absorbed wavelengths longer than 500 nm were synthesized. The first aminothiophene based imidazolinone dyes (ATI-1 and ATI-2) were synthesized and their electronic properties were evaluated. SELEX was performed on ATI-2 to find several random RNA sequences that were capable of binding the chromophore and activating ATI-2 fluorescence. It is proposed that fluorescence activated cell sorting can be used to separate and isolate the sequences that form the brightest complexes with ATI-2.

It is currently unknown how seasonal patterns of carbon dioxide, water, and heat flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere differ between fallow and wheat. This study quantifies the impact of dryland wheat vs. chemical fallow agricultural management practices on these important surface-atmosphere exchanges using the eddy covariance method across a winter wheat - spring wheat - fallow rotation in the Judith Basin, MT. I used a suite of meteorological sensors to measure relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture, wind speed and direction, incident and reflected shortwave radiation, upwelling and downwelling longwave radiation, crop height, and soil heat flux to further quantify the impacts of this cropping sequence on biophysical attributes of the land surface and to model turbulent fluxes. Both wheat fields were carbon sinks on the order of 110 to 205 g C m -2 during the April to September study periods of 2013 and 2014, while the fallow field was a carbon source to the atmosphere on the order of 135 g C m -2 during the April to September study period of 2014. Evapotranspiration (ET) was over 100 mm greater in a spring wheat field than in a simultaneously measured fallow field during the 2014 study period, and modeled maximum daily atmospheric boundary layer height was up to 800 m higher in fallow compared to spring wheat. Results demonstrate that fallow has a detrimental impact to soil carbon resources yet is less water intensive, with consequences for regional climate via its impacts on atmospheric boundary layer development and global climate via its carbon metabolism.

The goal of this work is to better understand and improve upon the most recent generations of genetically-encoded Ca 2+ and voltage sensors, and to expand biosensor utility in two-photon excitation, which will be necessary to image neural activity deep within the brain. Genetically-encoded Ca 2+ sensors measure the intracellular Ca 2+ release that occurs downstream of an action potential. The GCaMP6 series are the best Ca 2+ sensors available, however little is known about how they work. Measurements of four different states in GCaMP6m reveal that its large Ca 2+-dependent change in 470 nm excited fluorescence is due to a redistribution of the chromophore protonation state, from a neutral form excited at ~400 nm to an anionic form excited at ~470 nm, via a change in pK a. Making pK a-altering mutations in GCaMP6m changes the Ca 2+-dependent fluorescence response. This highlights the importance of Delta pK a and identifies key amino acid positions that will be important for improving GCaMP6m and GCaMP-like biosensors. A direct readout of an action potential would be ideal for capturing complex signal transduction in the brain. This will require a bright, fast voltage sensor. ElectricPk is the first genetically-encoded voltage sensor with a fluorescence response fast enough to resolve multiple action potentials in mammalian neurons. This design indicates it is possible to couple a fluorescence change with a very fast (~1 ms) voltage-dependent movement in the Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensitive phosphatase protein. Whether imaging a downstream Ca 2+ signal or a direct change in membrane potential, to image neuronal activity in deep brain tissue biosensors will need to be brightly fluorescent in two-photon excitation. The two-photon directed evolution of green fluorescent proteins presented here is a proof-of-principle design that shows a high-throughput screen focused on improving the two-photon properties of a fluorescent protein is possible.

Two neighboring mountain ranges in the northern Rockies of western Montana, USA, provide an ideal natural laboratory in which to investigate the relationship between soil chemical weathering, persistence of soil cover, and topography. We also examine the connection between the topography and climate history. The mountain ranges we explore are the previously glaciated Bitterroot Mountains, which consist of steep, rock-dominated hillslopes, and the neighboring unglaciated Sapphire Mountains which display convex, soil-mantled hillslopes. Soil thickness measurements, soil and rock geochemistry, and digital terrain analysis reveal that soils in the rock-dominated Bitterroot Mountains are less thoroughly weathered than those in the Sapphire Mountains. These differences are even greater when we adjust weathering for rock fragments and consider surface weathering intensity at a landscape scale using our newly developed metric, the rock-adjusted chemical depletion fraction (RACDF) and rock-adjusted mass transfer coefficient (RA t). The Bitterroots overall are 30% less weathered than the Sapphires despite higher mean annual precipitation in the former, with an average RACDF of 0.38 in the postglacial Bitterroots catchment and 0.61 in the nonglacial Sapphire catchment, suggesting that 38% of rock mass is lost in the conversion to soil in the Bitterroots, whereas 61% of rock mass is lost in the nonglaciated Sapphires. Though we find little evidence for modern climate influence on weathering, data suggest that precipitation may influence slope thresholds for soil cover. Forested soils persist on slopes that are 5Â° higher in the Bitterroots than the Sapphires (25Â° and 20Â° respectively), based on land cover data. Because the previously glaciated Bitterroots are less weathered despite being wetter, we conclude that the glacial history of this landscape exerts more influence on soil chemical weathering than does modern climate. However, while previous studies have correlated weathering intensity with topographic parameters such as slope gradient, we find little topographic indication of specific controls on weathering in these complex systems.

But obtaining information on a variety of variables, such as economic, socio-cultural, demographic and political factors, at the state level can be a difficult task. The public databases sometimes do not provide full information on these variables due to missing data. If these variables are neglected from the analysis because of missing data points. valuable information is lost in the process. Therefore, analyzing missing data has been considered as an additional step towards variable selection process in this thesis study. In order to impute the missing data, multiple imputation method was chosen. After the data imputation, the significant variables associated with road fatalities in 50 states were identified. This was done using a linear regression model which revealed that the top reasons for road fatalities are drunk driving, distracted driving and unemployment. In the process of linear regression modelling 48 predictive models were obtained. During the process of data collection, it was observed that data sources did not offer necessary information on road safety culture, behaviors, norms, attitudes and beliefs related to road fatality. This study offers two solutions for inferring a road safety culture and understanding its effects. The first solution was to analyze residuals from random effects two-way panel regression model and to generate performance indicator of inferred road safety culture. From the value of the indicators it was clear which state was the safest twenty years ago and which state is the safest now. Through the change in the value of the indicator, a state's progress in terms of safety culture was also measured. The second solution was to use people's political views on the democratic party and the republican party as a proxy for the road safety culture. This resulted in a significant increase in the goodness of fit for the linear regression model. This thesis provides prediction models, significant factors, and performance indicators of a road safety culture which can be used in state level road safety strategy development and policy making.

Depression is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, including one million suicide deaths annually. One rural Western state has a depression rate more than three times the national rate, and the highest rate of suicide in the U.S., nearly double the national rate. The setting of interest was a primary care clinic in this state, and the following research question was asked: among adult patients, does the routine administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) during wellness visits improve depression identification as compared to routine care? The project sample was gathered between May 2 and July 25, 2016, and consisted of 33 patients meeting the inclusion criteria gathered from a total patient panel of 1,479. Patients were screened for depression with the PHQ-2 during their wellness visits. Two new cases of depression were identified in the study group, compared to none in the control group. A randomization test, based on 5,000 trials, was done to assess statistical significance. The rate of new diagnosis with the depression screening tool was observed to be 0.062 with an associated 95% confidence interval of between 0 and 15.6%. Associated p-value was 0.243. Although 6.2% was not a statistically meaningful difference, this project holds clinical relevance. By implementing routine depression screenings, discussion of depression was found to be initiated more often, and patients' perceived barriers to seeking help for depression were addressed.

The National Institute of Medicine and the American Nurses Association have enforced the need for all nurses to increase their competency in addressing environmental hazards in the communities in which they provide care. Rural nurses face the challenging role of expert generalist. Several research studies demonstrate that there is a need to increase nurse's education to better address environmental hazards. The purpose of the Rural Nurse Environmental Health Education (RNEHE) Project was to: (a) investigate nurses' perception of priority environmental health topics within a specific rural community, (b) investigate learning methods that increase the probability of nurse participation in an Environmental Health (EH) learning activity, and (c) provide environmental risk reduction knowledge that is locally relevant. The anticipated outcome of the project was empowered rural nurses prepared to educate and advocate for EH in the communities in which they provide care. The Project utilized a two-phase approach to investigate priority topics and provide education that was specific to a group of nurses in rural central Montana. The Project resulted in a low participation rate despite utilizing preferred learning methods. The graduate nursing student concluded that education about environmental hazards in rural communities would be more successful with direct insider involvement in project planning and provision of education materials.

It is one of the most prevalent medical conditions, affecting between 50% and 90% of the general adult population in developed countries. Nonspecific low-back pain accounts for approximately 85% of all low-back-pain incidents in primary care, and the majority of these episodes will resolve within two weeks of onset. Care for low-back pain is often fragmented and results in a very heavy economic burden from both direct and indirect costs. Clinical-practice guidelines have been developed to improve patient care and outcomes, and decreased healthcare costs have been demonstrated when clinical-practice guidelines are followed. However, despite the wide availability of clinical-practice guidelines, adherence by primary-care providers is less than optimal. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program for primary-care providers in a rural clinic regarding the proper management of acute low-back pain following available clinical-practice guidelines. A quasi-experimental project design with retrospective chart reviews was conducted. Data from the first review, along with current evidence-based protocols for back-pain management, were used to develop an educational presentation for the primary-care providers of a family-medicine clinic in a rural, southwest Montana town. A second chart review was performed after the educational presentation to evaluate utilization of the evidence-based protocol of the primary-care providers. Results indicated a significant improvement in the prescription of methylprednisolone by primary-care providers, decreasing from 40% during the initial retrospective chart review to 0% during the second retrospective chart review. Other areas of the outcomes data, although not significant, showed improvement related to adherence to the clinical-practice guidelines by the primary-care providers. This indicates the educational intervention was overall successful in fulfilling the purpose of this project.

This relates to the amount of impact that aerosols and CO 2 can have on our atmosphere and climate system. CO 2 is the predominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and causes great impacts on our climate system. Recent studies show that a less well known atmospheric component--aerosols, which are solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in air, can cause great impact on our climate system too. They can affect our climate directly by absorbing and scattering sunlight to warm or cool our climate. They can also affect our climate indirectly by affecting cloud microphysical properties. Typically sulfate aerosols or sea salts act as condensation nuclei for clouds to form. Clouds are estimated to shade about 60% of the earth at any given time. They are preventing much of the sunlight from reaching the earth's surface and are helping with the flow of the global water cycle. These are what permit lifeforms on earth. In the IPCC report, both aerosols and CO 2 also have the largest uncertainties and aerosols remains at a low level of scientific understanding. These indicate the need of more accurate measurements and that new technologies and instruments needs to be developed. This dissertation focuses on the development of two instruments--a scannable Micro Pulsed Lidar (MPL) for atmospheric aerosol measurements and an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) for use as a transmitter in a Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) for atmospheric CO2 measurements. The MPL demonstrates successful measurements of aerosols. It provides the total aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol lidar ratio (S a) that agree well with an instrument used by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). It also successfully provides range-resolved information about aerosols that AERONET instrument is incapable of. The range-resolved information is important in the study of the sources and sinks of aerosols. The OPO results show good promise for its use as a DIAL transmitter.

Rural populations have a heightened risk for poor quality and high cost of end-of-life care. Advance care planning can be led by nurses to ensure end-of-lifecare reflects patients' wishes. Purpose: A doctoral project was completed to assess rural nurses' knowledge, attitudes and experiences with advance directives (ADs). Information gained was used to develop evidence-based recommendations to facilitate nurses in ACP. Sample: Participants were nurses who practice in rural settings (N = 22). Average age was 46.4 years. All were Caucasian (n = 22) and the majority were baccalaureate prepared (n = 12). Practice settings were primarily in home care (50%) and hospice (27%). Methods: The Knowledge, Attitudinal, and Experimental Surveys on Advance Directives were distributed. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results: The overall knowledge scores on ADs were low (57%). Nurses felt confident in counseling (n = 19) and initiating (n = 20) discussions with patients and families. Nurses believed they have administrative support (82%), but less physician support (50%) in ACP. Less than half of the nurses stated they are part of the ACP team at their facility (45%). Nurses described the need for more education, training and knowledge on ACP (n = 13). Nurses reported receiving no training on health perceptions of rural dwellers (64%) and some reported no training on providing culturally sensitive care to rural dwellers (45%). The majority reported access to AD resources (90%) and mentorship of younger nurses (95%) would be beneficial. Conclusions: Participants were confident in initiating and counseling patients with ADs, but indicated a need for additional education, time, and support from administration and physicians to better assist patients in ACP. Implications: A continuing education presentation was given in Cascade County on the survey results and recommendations for facilitation of nurses in the ACP process. Recommendations include: Providing workplace education, supporting nurses in ACP, mentoring young nurses in ACP, providing ACP resources, and providing cultural sensitivity through the incorporation of the Rural Nursing Theory. Project findings were published in The Pulse for dissemination on a statewide level.

By virtue of the trirutile structure, M-O-O-M chains propagate along [110] at z = 0 and [11overline0] at z = 1=2 of the unit cell. These chains are separated along [001] by sheets of weakly-interacting diamagnetic ions. The spin-exchange coupling perpendicular to the chains is weak, permitting the low-dimensional classification. Single crystals have been grown using chemical vapor deposition and the floating zone method. Magnetization, in-field heat capacity, and high-resolution thermal expansion measurements have been performed along various axes, revealing significant anisotropy due to the peculiar magnetic structures and low dimensionality. The Neel temperature, TN, at which long-range order occurs is found to be unstable against the application of magnetic field above 2 T. Large fields tend to lower TN of the set of moments with projections along the applied field. Moments which are aligned perpendicular to the field are significantly less affected. This can lead to the formation of a secondary peak in heat capacity when magnetic field is along either [110] or [11overline0]. The change in heat capacity at the location of the newly formed peak means there is a change in entropy, which depends upon the direction of applied field with respect to the magnetic moments. Consequently, an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect arises due to the unique magnetic structure. The anisotropic nature of this effect has potential applications in magnetic refrigeration.

In doing so, I highlight the fact that all events are historically contingent, undermining the idea that events are the result of inexorable historical processes. The case of the 1992 Chicago Fair provides an opportunity to glimpse a historical process suspended in time: there is not a satisfying conclusion to a fair that didn't happen, but there are both memories and a sizable archive. The planning and design chapters focus on how the fair planners made decisions, and on how they worked both with and against city and state governments as well as the Bureau of International Expositions. Using newspapers and documents culled from several archives as well as the official depository for fair materials, the Chicago History Museum, this narrative reveals the many missteps of the fair planners, and points to several specific factors that contributed to the fair's failure. The protest chapter adds to the growing analysis of protest movements in the 1980s, and situates the protestors' strategies in the social and political contexts of Chicago. The last chapter looks at the archive of the archivist. Archivist Evelyn Wilbanks' personal papers regarding the fair are also housed at the Chicago History Museum, and reading them leads to an investigation of the place of the archivist in the production of history.

Health care workers, facilities, and patients themselves often suffer negative consequences, both physically and mentally, by experiencing or witnessing WPV. An educational intervention, consisting of a pre-test, PowerPoint R presentation, and a post-test, was conducted to increase health care workers' knowledge regarding the therapeutic management of WPV. The intervention group (N=18) consisted of a variety of the direct care employees of an adult inpatient psychiatric facility in a rural/frontier western state. The educational intervention and tests were based on the Centers for Disease Control, Workplace Violence Prevention for Nurses Program (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 2014). Topics covered in the intervention included: definition of violence, types of violence, workplace violence consequences, and risk factors for violence, prevention strategies for health care workers, and intervention strategies. The goal was to compare the pre-test and post-test mean scores, in an effort to see if the educational intervention could significantly increase the participants' overall knowledge of WPV. Test data was analyzed using a dependent sample t-test of mean scores, as the same group completed both the pre-test and the post-test. Results indicated that the educational intervention significantly increased WPV knowledge of the participants. Future research would benefit from using a larger sample size and by conducting a long term project to identify if there was a correlation between the evidence-based WPV education and the overall reduced incidents and/or injuries related to WPV. Continued research is important as an effective system needs to be implemented to safely manage potentially dangerous situations while protecting health care workers.

First, the vegetation structure is highly uniform and typified by open grasslands with good visibility over long distances. Secondly the prey community is heavily dominated by wildebeest, with much lower numbers of zebra, oribi and other species. These characteristics combined with GPS data on a fine spatial scale, and a large observational dataset on both predators and prey enabled us to focus on several little-studied questions about the effects of predation risk in the wild. Interspecific competition between predators can be a strongly limiting force for subordinate predators like cheetahs and African wild dogs. Both species use niche partitioning to reduce the risk of dangerous interactions in different ways that appear to have ramifications for coexistence. Wild dogs showed more dietary and temporal overlap with dominant competitors while cheetahs combine divergence in diet, temporal avoidance and reactive local spatial avoidance to coexist with lions and hyenas in areas of high prey density, even in open habitats. These results provide new insight into the conditions under which partitioning may not allow for coexistence of African wild dog, while it does for cheetah, with dominant predators making wild dogs more prone to competitive exclusion (local extirpation), particularly in open, uniform ecosystems with simple prey communities. Focusing on predator-prey relationships the overall the conclusion is that the assessment of risk by animals is a very fine-tuned process. Our results confirm that both the risky places hypothesis (LT risk) and the risky times hypothesis (ST risk) are important, leading to both reactive and proactive responses. Critically, these effects do not act independently in their effects on the strength of antipredator responses. This interaction presents challenges for the design of research on risk effects. An effect of ST risk could be masked by unmeasured variation in LT risk (or vice versa), and an effect of ST risk might be caused by unmeasured variation in LT risk (or vice versa).

To better understand this phenomenon, this study deconstructed the application process and examined factors that may be influential in completion of critical application steps. This study explored the construct of academic self-efficacy along with bachelor's aspirations using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) to investigate the influence of these factors on two key steps in the college choice and application process: completion of a college entrance exam and submission of an application to a four-year institution. Two sets of logistic regression analyses were run to investigate the variables for each application step. Bachelor's aspirations were significantly associated with completion of both steps. English self-efficacy was associated with completion of a college entrance exam, but not application submission. Math self-efficacy was associated with submission of an application, but did not significantly influence college entrance exam completion. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the college choice process and reveal how factors that influence key steps in the application process may shift over time. Results also reinforce the importance of fostering high aspirations early in a student's high school career (or even earlier) and the need to build well-rounded academic self-efficacy for students since they may draw on different sources at different points in the college application process.

Background: It is crucial for FNPs to know where to locate and understand each state's Boards of Nursing (BON) statutes, administrative rules, and Nurse Practice Acts (NPAs) in order to legally practice. Significant liability issues can result if one ventures outside of their scope of practice. The safety of patients is increased when a provider explicitly knows his or her limits. It is also critical that graduate educational programs clearly articulate SOP for Nurse Practitioners (NPs), so that once they begin in clinical practice, they are better informed about their role, SOP and related boundaries. Methods: A quantitative, quasi-experimental design with consecutive sampling was used. Neither randomization nor a control group was employed. The researcher designed and created an evidence-based, recorded YouTube education presentation regarding FNP SOP in Montana, along with pre and post-education questionnaires that were distributed to four cohorts of FNP students at Montana State University College of Nursing. Descriptive statistics and the paired t-test were used to analyze the demographic data and measure gain scores between the pre and post-education questionnaires in order to evaluate if knowledge increased. Results: Results indicate that the YouTube educational presentation is associated with higher post-education scores (p < .001). Seven students fully completed all components of the project for a participation and retention rate of 22%. Conclusions: The results of this study can help guide FNPs who need to clearly understand the components that define NP SOP within their population-focused specialties. It highlights the need for graduate educational programs to clearly articulate the population-focused and specialty NP roles.	['law']

Experiments use time-resolved fluorescence, steady-state fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry to experimentally quantify solute partitioning in three specific regions of a model membrane, as well as track how solutes migrate into and out of lipid bilayers as a function of temperature. Phosphatidylcholine vesicles were comprised of DLPC (12:0 PC), DMPC (14:0 PC), and DPPC (16:0 PC). In all three lipid systems, coumarin 152 (C152) showed partitioning behavior that was qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. Partitioning into a gel phase membrane was slightly exothermic and slightly entropically unfavorable. Partitioning of C152 near the lipid membrane melting temperature was entropically driven and endothermic. Well above the melting temperature, exsolvation of C152 from the membrane back into the aqueous buffer was enthalpically driven but entropically unfavorable. Regardless of solution temperature, relatively little (<20%) C152 partitioned into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The magnitudes of the thermodynamic forces driving C152 partitioning systematically increased with alkyl chain length (DLPC < DMPC < DPPC). C152 and C461 differ solely in the 4-position where C152 has a trifluoro methyl group in place of C461's -CH3 group. Fluorescence amplitudes were used to calculate absolute partition coefficients and average number of solutes per DPPC vesicle. C152 shows a ~10-fold greater affinity than C461 for lipid bilayers, despite both solutes having similar log P values. Differential scanning calorimetry traces of vesicles composed of binary mixtures of lipids show moderate miscibility between DLPC and DMPC and low miscibility between DMPC and DMPE. Time-resolved fluorescence decays indicate C152 partitioning into mixed PC membranes is nearly ideal; that is, even if mixed PC vesicles do form single lipid domains, C152 partitioning behavior is largely unaffected. Time-resolved fluorescence decays show C152 partitioning behavior into PC/PE membranes is distinctly non-ideal, but the cause of this non-ideal behavior requires further studies.

In order for people to believe scientific findings, they must trust those presenting the studies. A person's trust is not related to his or her education level, but to perceived values of the scientists themselves. This occurrence affects not just scientific studies, but nonfiction films and literature, as well. To understand this phenomenon of scientific distrust, I studied successful nonfiction films and literature, as discussed in the body of the paper and case study. I produced a website to show how medical information and storytelling techniques can exist together. The site seeks to gather the Microtia community and dispel myths about this congenital deformity affecting hearing and ear development. The popularity of documentaries opens a dialogue of scientific discussions among experts and laypeople, as long as a filmmaker's values align with viewers' values. When documentary filmmakers design captivating characters that viewers can easily relate to, the scientific message is clear. Authors and filmmakers promote positive social changes when communicating science through storytelling.

Because the Meadowlands' wetlands had been perceived as worthless, dangerous, and a barrier to progress, over half of the Meadowlands' wetlands disappeared under drainage ditches and developers' fill as Greater New York expanded in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. Yet, today 8,400 acres of wetlands remain there; this dissertation seeks to explain why. This dissertation analyzes environmental preservation efforts in the Meadowlands from 1968 to 2004, including legislative efforts to pass the Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act in 1968, early Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission planning efforts and environmentalists' attempts to block construction of an incinerator and the Meadowlands Sports Complex in the early 1970s, the Environmental Protection Agency's veto of fill permits filed under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act in the 1980s, and grassroots environmentalists' efforts to block a Special Area Management Plan and the construction of the Meadowlands Mills Mall at the end of the twentieth century. These efforts culminated in the HMDC's adoption of a Master Plan in 2004 which barred all new development on the Meadowlands' wetlands. In each of these episodes, this dissertation analyzes the ways in which people defined nature, and the human relationship to it, in this place over time, and it explains how those definitions of nature shaped policy and the Meadowlands' landscape. It argues that 8,400 acres of wetlands remains in the United States' most densely populated metropolitan area stands as a testament to Americans' willingness to embrace humanized landscapes within their understandings of nature and their ability to force the environmental management system to protect such landscapes.

Experiments 1 and 2's objectives were to evaluate the effects of long-term P4 treatment, independent of the influence of the placenta and fetus, on changes in feed efficiency, BW, body composition, NEFA, metabolic hormones, and metabolites identified through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolic profiling in mature Rambouillet ewes. Thirty, multiparous, 5- and 6-yr-old Rambouillet ewes were stratified by age and metabolic BW and assigned randomly to receive long-term P4 administration using controlled intravaginal releasing devices (CIDR) or no P4 (CIDRX; CIDR backbone only). Sera samples and body weights were collected every 14-d, along with CIDR/CIDRX replacement. Sera samples were assayed for metabolic hormones, NEFA, and metabolites. There were no differences in BW, RFI, STDMI, body composition, or temporal patterns of T3, T4, NEFA, or metabolites between CIDR- and CIDRX-treated ewes. Insulin concentrations were greater in CIDR-treated ewes than in CIDRX-treated ewes. Long-term P4 did not affect metabolism or body composition, independent from the presence of a fetus or placenta. Progesterone may increase tissue sensitivity to INS. In Experiment 3, the primary aim was to determine if NMR metabolic profiling has the potential to serve as a management tool for evaluating herds of bighorn (Ovis canadensis) sheep. Bighorn sheep herds were sampled between December of 2014 to March of 2015 in Montana and Wyoming. The sampling included 240 bighorn sheep ewes from 13 herds from geographically distinct locations at different times of the year. Metabolites identified by NMR in bighorn sheep serum were analyzed by pathway enrichment analyses, PLS-DAs, and biomarker analyses to determine if bighorn sheep herds can be distinguished by pregnancy status, geographic location, or time of year. NMR metabolic profiling could not distinguish between pregnant and non-pregnant bighorn sheep. Metabolic profiling did differentiate bighorn sheep herds and identified a subset of potential biomarkers that discriminated distinct geographic locations and time of year. Thus, NMR metabolic profiling has the potential to develop a suite of metabolites that wildlife managers can use to assess bighorn sheep nutrition and overall health.

The family wage gap is the difference in earnings between parents and non-parents. Paid parental leave laws in California and New Jersey are exploited for a quasi-natural experiment using difference-in-difference-in-difference empirical models. Results show robust evidence that paid parental leave has negative impacts on young women's employment and earnings. Estimated impacts vary by education level, with employment effects concentrated among young women without a bachelor's degree, and earnings effects concentrated among young women with only some college experience. Additionally, results also show weakly suggestive evidence that paid parental leave decreases the family wage gap for both mothers and fathers.

The relationship between the perceptions of underage undergraduate students, alcohol consumption, and institutional legal responsibilities to protect them from foreseeable harm	This study looks at the perceptions of underage undergraduate students at the University of Wyoming (UW) regarding the institutionâs responsibility to protect them from foreseeable harm. It also quantifies the extent and nature of alcohol consumption by underage undergraduate students at UW. The research population that was identified for this study are undergraduate students enrolled full-time at the University of Wyoming between the ages of 18-21 years old. The author collected and analyzed 2,218 survey responses from the research population in this quantitative study. There were several demographic variables and factors that influenced the research participantsâ perspectives about university responsibility to protect them from foreseeable harm. Many of these factors influenced the research participantsâ reported level of consuming drinks that contained alcohol. Nevertheless, the research participants in this study did not overwhelmingly state that the university was responsible to protect them from foreseeable harm. Since the inception of American higher education in the 17th century, campus officials have stood in loco parentis and have enjoyed wide latitude to control the lives of students outside the classroom. College faculty and administrators under in loco parentis benefited from legal immunity in nearly all aspects of how they ran their institutions, especially in regard to controlling out of class activities and student behavior. The legal principles used to ensure student safety on the college campus continues to evolve during the early 21st century. Today, establishing the appropriate level of legal responsibility that a university has to protect students from foreseeable injury remains unclear. Understanding these responsibilities is vital for higher education institutions, as traditional-aged students continue to injure themselves after consuming high-levels of alcohol. Based upon this study, several recommendations are made to alter current university policies and resource allocation. Although not a call to return to in loco parentis, the data from this study suggests that university officials might consider adopting additional measures that enforce underage and high-risk drinking policies in on-campus living environments with high-concentrations of underage residents.

A range-wide strategy for restoration has been developed by leading managers in the field and focuses on promoting rust resistance, conserving genetic diversity, saving seed sources, and employing restoration treatments (Keane et al. 2012). These strategies are applied across the range of whitebark pine and rely on the collaboration of land managers, scientists, and academics. Seed Source The most promising strategy for restoration of whitebark pine is the out-planting of blister rust resistant seedlings (Keane et al. 2012). Due to the continuous loss of mature cone-bearing whitebark pine, it is necessary to collect seed for blister rust resistance screening, genetic conservation, and out-planting... For the large-scale planting of 36,000 whitebark pine seedlings on the Eureka Basin Burn in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, the first year survival of the 800 seedling subsample was high overall (94%). A method for examining how seedling-level planting variables such as colonization by suilloid ectomycorrhizal fungi, microsite type and position, slope, and potential soil moisture (TWI) affect seedling health and survival was developed and seedlings were monitored 3 and 14 months after planting. Further monitoring will continue to examine how long term seedling success is affected by these variables.	['life sciences', 'ecology', 'environmental sciences', 'biology', 'science']

Memory corruption and other faults caused by the harsh radiation environment are difficult to mitigate. The following Masters of Science thesis describes the design and testing of a radiation tolerant, low-cost computer system to meet the increasing demand of fault tolerant space computing. The computer is implemented on a modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which enables a novel fault mitigation strategy to be deployed on a commercial part, thus reducing the cost of the system. Using modern processing nodes as small as 28nm, FPGAs can provide increased computational performance and power efficiency. Common mitigation techniques like triple modular redundancy and memory scrubbing are expanded by utilizing partial reconfiguration on the FPGA and by introducing extra spare processors. Our computer system has been in development at Montana State University for the past 10 years and has undergone a series of technology demonstrations to increase its technical readiness level. These include high energy particle bombardment at the Texas A&M Radiation Effects Facility, 8 high altitude balloon flights to 30km, and two sounding rocket flights to altitudes greater than 120km. This computer is currently being demonstrated onboard the International Space Station and will be the payload for two stand-alone small satellite missions in low Earth orbit in 2018. This Masters of Science thesis presents improvements to the system by moving the design to a new, low power FPGA with a new processor synchronization method. This thesis will present the design, testing, and characterization of the computer system along with conveying data collected by the experiment on the International Space Station.

Participants received clicker questions with and without bar graph feedback or did not receive clicker questions during lecture. Overall, relative to the control group, clicker use enhanced immediate test performance. Clicker conditions did not differ in immediate or delayed test performance; however, when the majority of participants answered clicker questions correctly, test performance was enhanced only for those in the feedback group. When the majority answered clicker questions incorrectly, individuals in the no feedback group had marginally better test performance than those in the feedback condition, suggesting that bar graph feedback provokes source misattribution errors and interferes with one's ability to make corrections. Importantly, clicker use appears to enhance test performance, as long as individuals do not receive bar graph feedback when the majority answer clicker questions incorrectly. Thus, instructors should reconsider displaying bar graph feedback during clicker-based lectures. Finally, future research must explore the lack of delayed testing effects observed in this study.

With the support of the multinational public's explosive interest in spies and their politics, the literary world heralded the entrance of the professional provocateur into the numbers of the greatest literary figures ever known. But as the wars of the 20th Century and the role of the spy changed, cracks began to show in the edifices of state political morality through the cloak and dagger heroes of espionage fiction. Between two of the genre's most eminent authors, Ian Fleming and John Le Carre, the separation of representations of the West reveals the unique presence of an unspoken contradiction between the ethics of the British state and the ethics of the Western para-global societal alliance. Utilizing the heroism and liminality of the spy figure, these two authors portray the British state diametrically differently: one staunchly avoiding the friction and disillusionment of postwar Britain as a geopolitically ambiguous Western power, and the other embracing it. The differences in their Wests characterizes a series of evolving worldviews and perspectives on Britain's place within the Western hierarchy during the Cold War, emphasizing the growing social distance within the Anglo-American alliance and the development of the secret agent as a means of both reinforcing and subverting implicit societal ideals. By bringing into question not only what the West is to Britain, but why it can still be identified as a political entity even as it changes upturned perceptions of unity for the Western facade. The upheaval of this implicit perception highlighted the difference in the needs of two different generations of authors, readers, and spies to grapple with the ubiquitous presence of the West. For as in the clandestine world of real spies and their masters, nothing sacred, not even the West, can hold.	['literature', 'philology', 'fiction']

Minority, low income, and first-generation postsecondary education students utilize community colleges as a gateway to postsecondary education. Additionally, these institutions provide access to higher education for many nontraditional students, such as adults who work full time while enrolled. This study used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS SEM) to investigate and explore the relationship between community college student self-efficacy, engagement, and statistics conceptual understanding in the non-mathematical introductory statistics course and is based on Linninbrink & Pintrich's (2003) model for conceptual understanding. There is much research regarding statistics anxiety, statistics attitude, learning behavior, and statistics achievement where students at four year institutions or graduate students were studied, but few if any studies exist that investigate these same factors with community college students. Data for this study was collected from n=161 student volunteers at three different time points during the semester using all or a subset of the following instruments: Current Statistics Self Efficacy (CSSE) (Finney & Schraw, 2003), Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS) (Schau, Steven, Sauphinee, & Del Vecchio, 2995), Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993), and Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS) (delMas, Garfield, Ooms, & Chance, 2007). Problems with missing data were resolved with multiple imputation methods to preserve power and sample size and prevent introducing bias into the analysis. Overall, the relationships of self-efficacy and engagement explained R2=7.6% of the variance in conceptual understanding of statistics. This study found positive relationships between student conceptual understanding of statistics, selfefficacy to learn statistics and student engagement. Behavioral and cognitive engagement did not appear to mediate the influence of self-efficacy but motivational engagement was found to mediate this effect. Additionally, it was found that self-efficacy to learn statistics had a medium effect on statistical understanding at course end. Suggestions for future research are given.

It is a challenging problem, however, due to the difficulties of handling complex social network topologies and conducting accurate assessment in these topologies. To address these challenges, we model trust by proposing the three-valued subjective logic (3VSL) model. 3VSL properly models the uncertainties that exist in trust, thus is able to compute trust in arbitrary graphs. We theoretically prove the capability of 3VSL based on the Dirichlet-Categorical (DC) distribution and its correctness in arbitrary OSN topologies. Based on the 3VSL model, we further design the AssessTrust (AT) algorithm to accurately compute the trust between any two users connected in an OSN. AT is able to accurately conduct one-to-one trustworthiness, however, it is inefficient in addressing the massive trust assessment (MTA) problem, i.e., computing one-to-many trustworthiness in OSNs. MTA plays a vital role in OSNs, e.g., identifying trustworthy opinions in a crowdsourcing system. If the AssessTrust algorithm is applied directly to solve the MTA problem, its time complexity is exponential. To efficiently address MTA, we propose the OpinionWalk algorithm that yields an polynomial-time complexity. OpinionWalk uses a matrix to represent a social network's topology and a vector to store the trustworthiness of all users in the network. The vector is iteratively updated when the algorithm 'walks' through the entire network. To validate the 3VSL model, we first conduct a numerical analysis. An online survey system is then implemented to validate the correctness and accuracy of 3VSL in the real world. Finally, we validate 3VSL against two real-world OSN datasets: Advogato and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Experimental results indicate that 3VSL can accurately model the trust between any pair of indirectly connected users in the Advogato and PGP. To evaluate the performance of the AssessTrust and OpinionWalk algorithms, we use the same datasets. Compared to the state-of-art solutions, e.g., EigenTrust and MoleTrust, OpinionWalk yields the same order of time complexity and a higher accuracy in trust assessment.

The purpose of this study was to capture student perceptions of their own mindset shift and how their perceptions of mathematics changed. The conceptual framework used to interpret the findings was grounded in attribution theory. A case study research design bounded the perceptions of the students and the meanings they gave to these experiences. Data were collected and analyzed from multiple sources: participants' responses to writing prompts, focus group interviews, research field notes, and student artifacts. The grounded narrative that revealed itself from the student perspective over the course of this study was one of growing student trust in self and others as well as a deepening of student mathematical identity. It also showed that student perceptions of mathematics can shift in a short period of time (20 weeks) from a position of fear, shame, apprehension, and defeat to willingness, perseverance, joy, and overcoming challenges into a growth mindset. The recorded focus group discussions and various writing prompts captured the students' perceptions of their mindset shift in relationship to learning and deepening their understanding of mathematics. This study documents the power in individuals to shift out of a truncated learning cycle into a mathematical mindset. If the ability of students to shift from a fixed mindset into a growth mindset is dependent upon an educational environment, an educator's striving for a growth mindset becomes an important component.

This thesis describes (1) a bootstrap method of producing mesoscale, radiometrically-referenced hyperspectral data using the Landsat surface reflectance (LaSRC) data product as a reference target, (2) biophysically relevant basis functions to model the reflectance spectra, (3) an unsupervised classification technique based on natural histogram splitting of these biophysically relevant parameters, and (4) local and multi-temporal anomaly detection. The bootstrap method extends standard processing techniques to remove uneven illumination conditions between flight passes, allowing the creation of radiometrically self-consistent data. Through selective spectral and spatial resampling, LaSRC data is used as a radiometric reference target. Advantages of the bootstrap method include the need for minimal site access, no ancillary instrumentation, and automated data processing. Data from a flight on 06/02/2016 is compared with concurrently collected ground based reflectance spectra as a means of validation achieving an average error of 2.74%. Fitting reflectance spectra using basis functions, based on biophysically relevant spectral features, allows both noise and data reductions while shifting information from spectral bands to biophysical features. Histogram splitting is used to determine a clustering based on natural splittings of these fit parameters. The Indian Pines reference data enabled comparisons of the efficacy of this technique to established techniques. The splitting technique is shown to be an improvement over the ISODATA clustering technique with an overall accuracy of 34.3/19.0% before merging and 40.9/39.2% after merging. This improvement is also seen as an improvement of kappa before/after merging of 24.8/30.5 for the histogram splitting technique compared to 15.8/28.5 for ISODATA. Three hyperspectral flights over the Kevin Dome area, covering 1843 ha, acquired 06/21/2014, 06/24/2015 and 06/26/2016 are examined with different methods of anomaly detection. Detection of anomalies within a single data set is examined to determine, on a local scale, areas that are significantly different from the surrounding area. Additionally, the detection and identification of persistent anomalies and non-persistent anomalies was investigated across multiple data sets.

Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer's concept of the Anthropocene recognizes the human role in climate change and situates the species within a geological timescale. While the idea of the Anthropocene has been adopted by a wide group of academics, scholars working with what they call 'new materialism' describe this naming of our geological time as an overestimation of human agency. They emphasize a furious search for meaning in an environmental context that asserts human superiority to and separation from nature. Instead, new materialists rethink outmoded trends in environmental, historical, and literary theory by recognizing the agency of nonhuman nature. Interestingly, Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', anticipates the anxiety that emerges when humans confront the limits of their agency. He offers robotic animals, organic androids, and a post-apocalyptic space within which humans and nonhumans co-construct meaning and navigate the limits of agency in the late Anthropocene. New attention to materialism allows critics to recognize 'narrative agency,' which endows the nonhuman with meaning assembled with the human rather than through them. Through this material ecocritical framework, human/nonhuman and natural/cultural dualisms may be disrupted, allowing new ways to theorize the human. This paper traces the ways that Philip K. Dick lays the groundwork for an ecocritical posthumanism, demonstrating how nonhuman nature interacts with the human in ways that extend boundaries of agency. In his vision of the near future, the author engages readers in a critical conversation exposing problematic perspectives of nature and the human's place therein.

The objectives of this study were to implement a prenatal breastfeeding education toolkit, assess prenatal breastfeeding goals, gauge breastfeeding goal attainment at 10 weeks postpartum, and evaluate patient variables that may impact goal attainment. The educational information was compiled into a toolkit and divided into three sections, one for each trimester. After completing at least one trimester of education, patients were then asked to fill out a survey on their breastfeeding goals. They were contacted by phone at approximately 10 weeks postpartum to assess how their breastfeeding was progressing and if they were still on track to meeting their goals. A total of 20 participants were included in data analysis. The reported goal duration of the whole cohort ranged from 16 weeks to two years with an average of approximately 50 weeks. The majority (75%) reported that they planned to breastfeed exclusively. At 10 weeks postpartum, 65% of subjects were on track to or had met their goal breastfeeding duration. Subsequently, 35% reported early cessation of breastfeeding prior to reaching their goal. Of the 15 participants who planned to breastfeed exclusively, only about half (53%) were still exclusively breastfeeding at the time of follow-up. Patients who planned to supplement with formula from an early stage were more than twice as likely (60%) to have early cessation of breastfeeding compared to those who planned to breastfeed exclusively (27%). The results of this study suggest that most women would like to breastfeed exclusively and for longer periods of time. Unfortunately, many continue to fall short of their goals. Planning to breastfeed exclusively appears to increase the mother's chance of reaching her goals at ten weeks postpartum. The literature has shown that prenatal education has a positive impact on breastfeeding rates. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this study was unable to evaluate the impact of the entire prenatal breastfeeding education toolkit on breastfeeding goal attainment.

Studied since the 1960s, there are many aspects which are poorly understood. Logistical constraints have prevented sampling during the austral winter, a 4-month period of 24-hour darkness. Our knowledge of how the resident photosynthetic microorganisms respond during this period is limited. With inputs from ephemeral glacial-melt streams the lake level (stage) of Bonney has risen more than 3 m since 2004. With no outflow streams, the only known water loss is via ablation of the permanent ice-cover. A study of the spatial and temporal changes in the phytoplankton community structure during this period of rapid lake level rise is lacking. During the summers (November-January) from 2004-05 to 2014-15 an in situ submersible spectrofluorometer was deployed in Lake Bonney to quantify the chlorophyll-a concentrations (microgram L -1) of four functional groups of microalgae (green algae, brown/mixed algae, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria) using known excitation/emission spectra. During the 2013-14 field season this same instrument was mounted on autonomous cable-crawling profilers deployed in both east and west lobes of Lake Bonney, obtaining the first ever daily profiles of chlorophyll-a concentration at an annual scale. Following a summer of rapid lake level rise (2010-11), an increasing trend in depth integrated chlorophyll-a concentration was observed in Lake Bonney. During the same period, the nutrient poor surface water has become increasingly dominated by green algae. Dramatic shifts were also observed in the phytoplankton communities during the polar night. The highest concentrations of mean chlorophyll-a were measured during the 24-hour darkness. Algal spectral groups containing species capable of a mixotrophic metabolism (brown/mixed and cryptophytes) increased in concentration and relative abundance when photosynthetically active radiation was unavailable. This work provides valuable contributions to our knowledge of long-term and year-round phytoplankton community dynamics in Lake Bonney, and improves our understanding of the metabolic strategies employed by organisms in this high latitude permanently ice-covered lake.

The current experiments examined if individual differences in true self would influence participants' reliance on their own memory relative to another person's memory and potentially influence the magnitude of the social contagion effect. Across two experiments, we primed differences in participants' true self and then asked them to remember visual scenes alongside a confederate who falsely suggested certain items had appeared in the scenes. In both experiments, participants incorporated the confederate's suggestions into their own subsequent recall and recognition. In Experiment 1, true self had no impact on the magnitude of the social contagion effect on recall or recognition performance. In Experiment 2, true self again had no impact on the magnitude of the social contagion effect on recall, but participants primed with intrinsic and achievement self reported a higher proportion of remember responses for falsely recalled items, and on recognition, individuals in the neutral condition falsely recognized fewer words than individuals in the achievement group. These findings are discussed in relation to source monitoring theory.

In seeking to understand how identity construction is intertwined with a text's online circulation, I've focused on Clint Eastwood's American Sniper as an act of online trolling. In looking at articles written about the film, along with comments accompanying both the film and articles, I've found a pattern which centers on deeply-held orientalist beliefs about the Middle East. Additionally, the online circulation of these texts reveals a strawman-styled othering process in which rhetors, ranging from Eastwood himself to anonymous online contributors, define themselves not by what they believe, but by what they are not. Ultimately, this analysis exposes the paradoxical element of rhizomatic communities: in an online world, where there is often no discernable connection to a static, geographic place, users create their identities by denigrating perceived 'other' ideologies. Instead of focusing on what makes them (in this case) American, users condemn the opposing political side, and then attribute all the remaining positive qualities to themselves.

Because of this, it is important for scholars and educators to critically consider what messages the literature is passing on to and about adolescents. Texts that feature youth in foster care break from the tradition in some important ways, giving greater influence and visibility to the institutional authorities that operate in the lives of youth. Critically examining these texts allows insight into the messages inherent in the literature about adolescent agency and authority, and the way such messages reinforce the cultural construct around youth in general, and foster youth specifically. This project begins with an examination of the theoretical background around the cultural construct of youth, the critical merit of young adult literature, and the institutional authorities at work in both. Then, these ideas are applied to the critical textual analysis of four recent, popular young adult novels that feature youth in foster care. Looking across the text set from this position demonstrates the power of the institutions over individual agency. Additionally, the web of authority created by the muddying of any defining lines within and between institutions and the lack of stability in their lives makes coming to any single sense of self nearly impossible. At the end of each text, the only option they have to find any stability is to give up their agency and submit to the institutions that operate in their lives. The analysis shows that the literature that is available fails to show the complicated life of foster youth for what it is, instead reinforcing the stereotypes while continuing to support the status quo. Studies like this one may be able to help break from the tradition and allow for a more critical reading of young adult literature, giving agency back to the very youth targeted by the texts.

The symptoms of PTSD can last months or years and prevent a full recovery from critical injury or illness. Patients that experience ICU delirium are at the highest risk for developing post-ICU PTSD. Many hospitals in Europe have begun using ICU after care programs to help patients cope with traumatic ICU memories and prevent a PTSD diagnosis. Purpose and Methods: The purpose of this project was to develop a nurse-led ICU after care program to prevent instances of PTSD in adult ICU survivors. Patients volunteered to participate in this project after seeing advertisements posted in the ICU and after receiving invitation letters in the mail at home. Patients were screened for PTSD using the PTSS-14, had a chance to speak with an ICU nurse about their experiences in ICU, and one patent was even able to return to the ICU and speak about that experience. Patients were then re-screened for PTSD approximately 2 weeks after their after care experience. Findings: Small sample size precludes any evaluation of this intervention. However, all participants did demonstrate evidence of decreased anxiety scores after their participation. Implications: Future ICU aftercare programs may have increased participation if the data collection period is extended to at least six months and if the patients are contacted closer to 3 months post ICU discharge. PTSD itself and the Rural Nursing Theory may decrease participation in these programs without specific interventions to address them.

Disparity between the requirements of the applications and the capabilities of the network leads to degraded application performance, which in turn results in a drop in application usage or revenue. For example, many real-time interactive applications require lower latency than the public Internet provides, resulting in a poor experience for application users. At other times though, applications fail to effectively utilize all network capabilities. For example, conventional electrical appliances are currently unable to leverage the increased communication capabilities provided by the future smart power grid to decrease costs or modify consumption. Scheduling is an optimization technique to temporally and spatially allocate resources in such a way as to achieve some desired parameter optimization, such as minimized cost. In this dissertation, I study the use of scheduling techniques to counteract application performance degradation present due to the disparity between application requirements and network capabilities. I explore this disparity in both the smart grid and cloud networks, and propose novel algorithms that rely on numerous algorithmic techniques to realize application performance increases.

This project addresses the minimal curricular presence of contemporary rural literary representations in the secondary English classroom. It investigates rural depictions in several Young Adult (YA) novels which reveal the persistent presence of stereotypical depictions of rural people and places. Because of the presence of these stereotypes, this project offers an analysis tool for engaging with rural texts called the Critical Rural Perspective. This paper also examines some possible benefits of using rural YA literature in the classroom. When contemporary rural YA novels are read in the classroom, students can transfer their understanding of the discursive construction of rurality seen in textual representations to the ways that language is used to create what it means to be rural. By becoming aware of the construction of rural identity, students can analyze, resist, and manipulate the single story of rurality which can set the stage for a more nuanced societal understanding of rural people.

Participants read three different stories processed with three different encoding strategies. Each story had two encoding strategies, but participants were only given one strategy per story (Pichert & Anderson, 1977). Later participants recalled and recognized the stories in three test trials. Recall occurred either individually or collaboratively. Pairs of participants read the same stories with the same strategy (congruent condition), the same stories with different strategies (incongruent condition) or the same stories with no strategy (control condition). Participants in incongruent groups did not show an effect of collaboration or collaborative performance equaled nominal performance, whereas congruent collaborative groups showed standard collaborative inhibition effects (Wright & Klummp, 2004). After recall, a two-part recognition test occurred individually. Prior collaboration and strategy influenced importance judgments. Participants formerly in collaborative groups rated items congruent with their strategy as more important and items incongruent with their strategy as less important than did nominal groups. When working in a collaborative group, perhaps attending to different information ameliorates retrieval strategy disruption and aides in the process of collaboration. Additionally, prior collaboration affects importance ratings on a subsequent recognition test.

The systems investigated are colloidal transport in a microcapillary, bifurcation and porous medium, reactive transport in porous medium, transport through beta-lactoglobulin gels and the effect of peptide surfactants on droplet deformation in a Taylor-Couette device. Complex transport phenomena underlies many applications in engineering and thorough understanding of convective and diffusive motion in multiphase systems is important. MRM allows for the investigation of multi-phase transport phenomena noninvasively and can be used to investigate different moments of motion by sequence of the application of magnetic field gradients. The measurement of coherent and incoherent motion separately and the simultaneous measurement of multiple phases (colloids or suspending fluid) is possible. The colloidal flow studies show the effects shear induced migration, deposition, incoherent and coherent motion have on the macro- and microscopic structure of the fluids. Results show the direct effect increased shear has on the onset of secondary and chaotic fluid motion due to microscopic particle-particle and macroscopic fluid-structure interactions indicating the presence of shear thresholds. Reactive transport in porous media is important for understanding the spread of contaminants in the Earth's subsurface. The effect of calcium carbonate precipitation in a model porous medium due to Sporosarcina pasturii growth on the hydrodynamics was measured using MRM. These measurements show an increase in mechanical mixing causing a more rapid asymptote to Gaussian dynamics than for the same system without precipitation. The transport measurements of water with and without NaCl flowing through a homogeneous (pH 7.0) and heterogeneous (pH 5.2) beta-lactoglobulin gels quantifies the hydrodynamic dispersion in the gels and provided direct information on the gel structure noninvasively. Droplet deformation of (36/64)%wt toluene/chloroform droplets in a continuous phase of glycerol inside a Taylor-Couette device with and without surfactants (2%wt Tween60, AM1 and AFD4 peptide surfactants) is measured using a rapid MRM sequence (ROTACOR) which compensates for system rotation. MRM measurements show a restriction to droplet deformation due to the presence of the peptide surfactants.

In an area of limited resources, an abundance of solar and wind resources is seldom utilized to its full potential. Scientists and support crews spend months at a time living in isolation within the confines of small outposts and stations. Confinement in cramped and impersonal surroundings in this hostile environment can have devastating effects on the health and well-being of research teams and crews. The designs of many facilities rarely venture beyond the minimum programmatic requirements, failing to explore the possibility to become something more. The purely functional engineer's design approach, focusing heavily on initial cost, has been the mainstay of Antarctic architecture until recently. This attitude is beginning to be challenged by designs that focus on sustainability and the psychological impact on their inhabitants. Isolation and climactic conditions should not serve as an excuse for an incohesive atomistic design, but as motivation for a responsible, holistic solution. The technology exists to drastically reduce our negative environmental and carbon footprint in Antarctica by creating more responsible research facilities that fully utilize available renewable energy resources, while providing a superior working and living environment that meets the physical and psychological needs of its occupants. During the austral summer of 2008-2009, the world's first zero emissions polar research station is set to open. The innovative design of the Belgian Princess Elisabeth station can be used as a model for studying the potentials of sustainable and climactically adapted architectural design in Antarctica. I propose to further explore the possibilities of renewable energy, waste management, and prefabrication to design a zero emissions research facility with minimal impact that is responsive to its environment, while adequately providing for the needs of its occupants within the unique and extreme conditions of the Antarctic.

My project will use specific architectural layering devices, such as colors, texture, light, physical structure to create an environment which will stimulate person's mind and imagination. This unique environment will stimulate a person's sense and the world and will rejuvenate the individual as he or she reflects what life could be beyond ordinary life.

Bison are keystone herbivores in YNP, and are central to several management controversies due to their infection with brucellosis. I integrated 100 years of historical count data with 7 years of recent vital rate data, and parameterized a matrix model using these vital rates to validate population growth estimates and to project future management scenarios involving disease control through vaccination and/or culling programs. From count data, I determined that historical population growth rates were heavily influenced by supplemental feeding, resulting in high population growth rates (Ã« = 1.17). I found evidence for density dependence in two subpopulations, the northern and central herds. The herds displayed divergent population dynamics over 1970-1981 and 1982-2000, as density dependence weakened in the northern herd and increased in the central herd, and herd growth rates were negatively correlated after 1982 (R2=0.40, P<0.01) I postulate the severe winter of 1982 catalyzed emigration from the central herd to the northern herd. Survival and birth rates did not differ between the herds 1995-2001, and calf-adult ratios did not differ between the herds or the periods. I found that snow pack was negatively associated with the central herd population growth rates, and with spring calf ratios and recruitment (R2=0.26-0.60, P<0.05). Birth rates were not variable with density-dependent or density-independent factors, but did vary according to serological status for brucellosis and with age structure, as primiparous bison had lower birth rates than adults. I did not detect reproductive or survival senescence. Adult survival rates were high and static (0.92). Integrating these vital rates into a matrix model resulted in a population growth rate estimate of Ã«=1.07, which closely corroborated an estimate of Ã« from count data during 1990-2000 (Ã«=1.05). Simulating the effects of brucellosis eradication through vaccination programs resulted in Ã« = 1.09, roughly a 29% increase. I concluded brucellosis eradication could further increase bison population growth rates, exacerbating conflicts outside YNP.

Lectures can be an efficient means to introduce new material, however they do not allow for all students to actively participate. Some students are engaged in answering questions and asking them during lecture, but many are not. They passively sit and observe. Without their participation it is difficult for the instructor to gauge their understanding. The purpose of this study was to see if the use of student electronic response systems could help students increase their understanding and retention of the biology curriculum. An electronic student response system involving clickers was used over the course of a semester. Exam scores, student interviews, and surveys were used to evaluate their effectiveness. A comparison of exam scores did not show a statistically significant difference. Student and teacher opinions were very positive as a large majority of student respondents said that clickers help to engage them in the learning process.

Tourists travel as quickly as possible to see as much as they can, and after arriving at a station or airport they will leave the terminal in the travel mindset and still be focused on efficiency and speed, preventing them from connecting with the character of their destination on a deeper level. It is my goal to create a transition space for travelers that mediates between the intimate character of place and the ubiquitous nature of high speed travel. By designing for a traveler's inertia I believe that architecture has the potential to better transition people between speed space and the experiential realm. Slowing down the tourist can allow for more meaningful experiences of place and let the traveler engage more deeply with one's physical environment.

These impacts are due, in part, to the viscoelastic material properties of biofilm. Of particular interest is the response of biofilm to changing hydrodynamic conditions and its effect on potential for biofilm removal. The goal of this research was two fold; 1) to develop a three dimensional numerical model, incorporating the viscoelastic material description of biofilm, to simulate the response of biofilm to varying hydrodynamic conditions and 2) use this model to identify behavioral characteristics of said biofilm which provide insight into effective removal procedures. Using a viscoelastic Burger fluid material description for biofilm, a numerical fluid-structure interface model was developed. The model was three-dimensional, allowed various sizes and shapes of biofilm to be defined, and was used in a parametric study to investigate biofilm behavior. The effect of the Burger material parameters and flow velocity were investigated. Additionally, the time scale over which microbial processes may influence biofilm material properties was identified and considered along with the results of the parametric study. Simulations revealed a consistent trend: biofilm clusters in flow channels undergo a transition from decreasing rates of deformation to increasing rates due to the interrelated effects of fluid-induced drag and cluster deformation. The results suggested that biofilm clusters which undergo a transition to accelerated deformation, in a time period shorter than that suggested to be influenced by microbial processes, are destined to eventual detachment. Identification of such behavior has significant impacts on biofilm removal methodology.

This dominant cultural attitude towards death is detrimental to everyone involved in the dying process. There is a collective of people comprised of doctors, therapists, parents, spouses, nurses, and children who believe in the human capacity to die well. This group of individuals has a vision for transforming how we die in our country. At the center of that vision is an effort to effectively communicate to the general public that there is a crisis surrounding end-of-life experiences. Moreover, this group of individuals discovered that the most effective way to communicate this message to the public is to share stories of those who have died in a manner that both informs and educates the public. Documentary films focused on death and dying stories that both inform and engage the viewer have the ability to greatly sway social constructs surrounding death and dying. Thus, the documentary, if done well, can be a powerful tool for helping people cope with the process of dying. By examining three death and dying documentaries, and isolating the techniques used by filmmakers to inform and engage the audience, I provide recommendations for making an effective death and dying documentary.

However, feeding plant protein diets has some drawbacks in terms of reduced growth and poor feed efficiency. This dissertation evaluated the production cost of alternative protein diets for commercial production of rainbow trout. Also, it identified the microbiota and gene functions associated with alternative diets and how they differ between mid- and hind-gut sections of the rainbow trout intestine. Furthermore, it determined differences in microbial community compositions and functions in the luminal and mucosal GIT of trout when fed alternative diets, with/without prebiotics. Lastly, the significance of diet and water as environmental factors shaping the mucosal and luminal bacterial compositions in trout was investigated. Experiment 1 demonstrated that trout growth and body indices were not affected by feeding plant protein diet (PPD). In experiment 2, shotgun metagenomics revealed predominant bacterial population in trout microbiota. Genes related to carbohydrate metabolism were increased in the hindgut intestine of those fed PPD. Experiment 3 demonstrated that replacing fishmeal with 75% GDDY did not alter growth of trout, but not feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR). High inclusion of GDDY in trout diet resulted in enrichment of catabolic genes involving branched chain amino acids in trout midgut region. Experiment 4 showed that rearing in a recirculating water system significantly improved trout performance compared to rearing in a flow-through water system, while feed intake and FCR increased in fish raised in the flow-through system. Water samples were more diverse than GIT samples. Bacterial diversity was greater in mucosal scrapings of the GIT than in the lumen. Water system played a major role influencing the microbial communities in trout luminal and mucosal GIT. The lumen shared similar bacteria with the rearing water. The results of this study demonstrated that plant protein can effectively substitute for fishmeal in trout diets. It further showed that trout GIT microbiota vary between the mid- and hind-GIT. The hind-, but not the mid-GIT microbiome appears to be modulated by diet, while the mid-GIT is affected by water system.

"Published children's literature in the United States overrepresents some identities while underrepresenting others, such as people of color, LGBT people, people with disabilities, people who live below the poverty line (Crisp et al., 2016), and more. Thus, some children may not encounter text representative of their identities. As literature can assist with identity development and provide ways for children to learn about those who differ from self, the lack of diversity in children's books disadvantages children with minoritized and majoritized identities (Bishop, 2012; Koss, 2015; Lifshitz, 2016; Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012). School librarians function as gatekeepers through the purchase and promotion of various texts. The decisions made by these gatekeepers may enable greater access to representative literature or may limit access. This illustrative case study with a descriptive survey examines the frequency with which librarians promote diverse literature, their comfort level doing so, and how they describe the factors that impact their decisions regarding diverse text. The researcher created an online survey on Qualtrics with both quantitative and qualitative questions and emailed 1,137 elementary school librarians in Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming to request participation in the survey. One hundred and sixteen librarians completed the survey. Eight participants self-selected for interviews. Librarians felt most uncomfortable promoting books with LGBT characters, and were most likely to ""never"" promote these books than any other type of diverse identity listed in the survey. Two main themes emerged from this study: internal and external factors impact librarian decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts, and some librarians may self-censor purchase and/or promotion of diverse texts. This study offers insight into the factors that impact librarian decision making, as well as how frequently librarians promote diverse texts and their comfort level promoting diverse literature. The study concludes with an examination of the implications from this study, including lack of available texts reflective of LGBT identities, a possible need for training regarding intellectual freedom and the librarian code of ethics, and the impacts of budget issues. Finally, recommendations for future studies are explored, which may further illuminate this under-researched area."	['literature', 'philology']

In our dissertation, we define and demonstrate quality measures for evaluation and comparison of overlapping, real-time, spatio-temporal data providers and for assessment and optimization of data acquisition, system operation and data redistribution. Our measures are tested on real-world data and applications, and our results show the need and potential to develop our own mechanisms for outlier and anomaly detection. We then develop a representative, near real-time solution for the identification of outlying sensors that far outperforms state of the art methods in terms of accuracy and is computationally efficient. When applied to a real-world, meteorological data set, we identify numerous problematic sites that otherwise have not been flagged as bad. We identify sites for which metadata is incorrect. We identify observations that have been mislabeled by provider quality control processes. And, we demonstrate that our method outperforms enhanced versions of state of the art methods for assessment of accuracy using comparable or less computation time. There are many quality-related problems with real data sets and, in the absence of an approach like ours, these problems may have largely gone unidentified. Our approach is novel for the simple but effective way that it accounts for spatial and temporal variation, and that it addresses more than just accuracy. Collectively these contributions form an overarching data-mining framework and example that can be used and extended for data-mining method development, model building and evaluation of spatio-temporal outlier and anomaly detection processes.

When conducting sexual assault research among college students, it is important to consider risk factors that contribute to revictimization and protective factors that buffer against negative outcomes. Although research has shown the effect of self-compassion on many of the negative outcomes associated with sexual victimization, little work has been conducted with a population of sexual assault survivors. In Study 1, participants with a history of unwanted sexual experiences (N = 16) completed a packet of surveys and a semi-structured interview about coping with and healing from their experience. The interview transcripts reflected many of the key domains of self-compassion, suggesting the need for additional research to understand the association between self-compassion and healing from unwanted sexual experiences. In Study 2, introduction to psychology students (N = 231) completed a battery of measurements to assess their sexual victimization history and associated negative outcomes, as well as protective factors including self-compassion. Analyses tested the hypothesis that greater self-compassion would predict less sexual revictimization among those who reported an unwanted sexual experience earlier in life. Although previous unwanted sexual experiences were positively associated with recent unwanted sexual experiences, there was neither a direct nor indirect effect through self-compassion. Findings from Study 1 suggest that different facets of self-compassion represent factors that both help and hinder coping and healing following an unwanted sexual experience. Although Study 2 failed to find a significant relationship between self-compassion and revictimization, self-compassion was associated with other variables previously shown to predict sexual assault and revictimization. More research is needed to understand the role of self-compassion in healing from sexual trauma and preventing revictimization.	['persons', 'students', 'college students']

Emerging research, as well as this study, shows that positive learning behaviors such as persistence, attention to task and adaption to change in routines can mediate negative influences of poor social-emotional behaviors and at-risk home environments (McTigue, Washburn & Liew, 2009). These positive learning behaviors are referred to as academic resilience, traits that are gaining increasing awareness as important to academic achievement. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among social and emotional factors, home environment, academic resilience and reading achievement for third-grade students who participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2004). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Stata 14.0 (Stata Corp., 2105) was used to analyze the relationships and to answer the research questions for this study. Additionally, SEM analysis was conducted based on the third-grade model was conducted by gender, socioeconomic status, and racial groups. Social and emotional behaviors were found to have a significantly negative relationship with academic resilience and reading achievement. Home Environment was not found to be significantly related to either academic resilience or reading achievement. Academic resilience was found to mediate 33% of the total effects of negative social and emotional behaviors on reading achievement. Similar results were found for the subgroup analyses. This study highlights the importance of academic resilience behaviors for mediating the negative social and emotional factors many students struggle with every day. Results from this study suggest the inclusion of social and emotional learning in the K-12 curriculum beginning in the primary years. Such instruction can bolster behavior related to academic resilience and thus promote increased academic achievement. School administrators will need to select a curriculum that is complementary to community programs that seek to provide the same type of instruction and to meet the needs of school and community stakeholders in general. Teachers will need to reconsider instructional responsibilities to include the integration social and emotion learning into classroom instruction.

Oral health conditions are becoming a silent epidemic and during pregnancy the risk increases for oral disease (Qualis Health, 2015; Vamos, Walsh, Thompson, Daley, Detman, & DeBate, 2015). About 40% of pregnant women have a varying form of periodontal disease (Lieff et al., 2004). The social impact on school-age children substantially affects their academics, as more than 51 million school hours are lost each year due to dental related illnesses (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). The purpose of this project was to educate providers, nurses, and patients in a primary care clinic on the importance of oral health care and to create simple referral process for at risk patients. The author gave a pretest on oral health best practice to seven primary care nurses. After the pretest, the author gave an oral health education seminar. The nurses took a posttest based on content from the educational seminar. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were given oral health surveys to determine oral health status and need for referral to a dentist. Six of the seven nurses completed the seminar and testing showing a higher post-seminar test score. The V-statistic of 21 showed a p-value of 0.0178 suggesting strong evidence the nurses' scores tended to be higher after the seminar. Of the nineteen adults surveyed regarding their oral health status, 62% showed good oral health behaviors. Of the eleven pediatric patients surveyed regarding their oral health status, 75% answered positive oral health behaviors. The literature supported the value of oral health education in primary care. Awareness was created in the clinic with the use of posters and educational packets given to all participating patients. There is a great need for preventive oral health education to primary care providers, pregnant women, childbearing age females, and parents of children. Current research on the value of preventive oral health education and dental care is needed in primary care.

This taxon is hypothesized to be a burrowing dinosaur, which cared for its young within these burrows. This dissertation is a broad three-part treatment of this taxon, and excepting the introductory and concluding chapters this dissertation consists of three main chapters. Chapter two describes the osteology and phylogenetic relationships of this animal. Notable features of the Oryctodromeus skeleton described include a network of ossified tendons along the vertebral column that completely ensheath the tail, a long tail that forms more than half the length of the animal, and unusual femoral heads whose morphology may be related to burrowing behavior. The first full skeletal and skull reconstructions of this animal are presented. Chapter three investigates patterns of preservation of Oryctodromeus. Data suggests that preservation of single to multiple individuals of this taxon typically occurred in burrows that may be difficult to impossible to recognize in the fossil record. New examples of burrows from Oryctodromeus from the Vaughn and Wayan, as well as additional evidence for social behavior, are also described. A third chapter details the ontogenetic histology, growth rates and patterns of skeletal fusion based on seven limb elements (femora and tibiae) from different individuals. Based on the data in this dissertation, three growth stages can be recognized in Oryctodromeus based on bone histology. Juveniles are defined by more rapidly growing fibrolamellar tissue, sub-adults are defined by a cortex of inner fibrolamellar tissue and outer zonal parallel fibered tissue, and near-adult individuals have tissue similar to sub adults with dense avascular bone in the outermost cortex that signals a decrease in growth rate. LAG's suggest a minimum age of six to seven years for more mature individuals. Patterns of neurocentral fusion in Oryctodromeus appear similar to those of crocodylians and some other small ornithischians, while the growth rates of Oryctodromeus appear slower than those of some dinosaurs, but similar to taxa such as Orodromeus and Tenontosaurus.

My empirical strategy uses conditionally random variation in the timing and location of serious excessive force incidents within Chicago to identify the causal relationship between these incidents and local crime. I also explore how this relationship changes with proximity to where a brutality incident occurred, the race of the victim, and the race of the offending officer. I find that, within a month after a brutality incident occurred, the average incident is associated with a one percent decrease in citywide violent crime. Within a community where an incident occurred, however, there is a three percent increase in violent crime and a two percent increase in total crime. Expanding out to the district, the total crime effect disappears, and the violent crime effect diminishes to two percent but remains positive. I also find that if the victim of a brutality incident is black, the community-level effect on violent crime increased to four percent, the district-level effect on violent crime increased to seven percent, and property crime increased by six percent at the district-level. If the offending officer is white and the victim is black (a.k.a. if the incident is potentially racially charged), there is a ten percent increase in total crime and an 18 percent increase in property crime within a month after the incident, both at the community-level.

Participation in religious activities involves both time and money. As such, individuals who make decisions about whether to be religious and the intensity of participation are making decisions concerning these scarce resources. This paper examines how income changes for low-income individuals affect religious giving and attendance decisions. Change in the Earned Income Tax Credit across states, over time, and by number of children is used as an exogenous source of variation in income. Using an instrumental variables strategy, I find evidence that positive changes in income reduce religious participation for low-income individuals and households. To the extent that religious behaviors and institutions constitute net benefits to society, policymakers should be careful to include reduction in religious behaviors as a possible cost to public cash transfer programs.

Sometimes this mental schema contains misconceptions. This study used the Conceptual Change Model as a methodology to identify these misconceptions and target instruction with experiments that gave students the opportunity to validate or invalidate these preconceptions. A group of 63 fourth grade students and four elementary teachers were involved in this study. The CCM methodology was used in a unit on heat and energy that spanned an eight week time period. Students were interviewed before the unit and diagnosed for misconceptions with pre assessment questions. After treatment students were then assessed with the same questions and the percentage difference between pre and post answers was analyzed. Data from this study indicate that the CCM is an effective tool in dispelling student misconceptions as well as helping students who have no preconceptions in place at all to develop valid mental schemas. Additionally the results suggest that the CCM stimulates student interest and engagement in science. Elementary teachers also indicated that the help of a science specialist was beneficial in implementing the CCM effectively.

The bacterium causes respiratory and also cutaneous disease predominantly in immunocompromised patients, but infection also occurs in otherwise healthy individuals. M. avium has been frequently isolated from drinking water and it has been shown that the bacterium forms biofilms in drinking water systems. Biofilms show enhanced resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants and therefore are difficult to combat. Biofilm formation is a complex multistep process, and the bacteria change their physiology quite significantly upon entering the attached life style. The process is initiated by a number of triggers that are of both environmental and microbial origin. In this dissertation, biofilm formation was investigated using three different approaches. Firstly, the effect of the universal quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2) was investigated. The addition of AI-2 to M. avium cultures results in enhanced biofilm formation and transcriptional studies revealed that the bacterium reacts to the compound with upregulation of the oxidative stress response. Oxidative stress was then directly investigated by addition of hydrogen peroxide, also resulting in enhanced biofilm formation. Therefore, it was concluded that oxidative stress leads to M. avium biofilm formation. Furthermore, the importance of the mycobacterial cell wall was studied by comparing biofilm formation of mutants in cell wall-related proteins with the parent strain. These studies revealed a role in biofilm formation that is dependent on the material properties of the surface. Finally, the effect of other bacterial strains and their metabolic by-products on M. avium biofilm formation was studied, as well as the influence of the medium. Although the presence of other bacteria influenced biofilm formation, concentration of the important co-factor iron was shown to be particularly significant in enhancing the process. Collectively, these data suggest that M. avium biofilm formation is enhanced when the bacterium encounters oxidative stress or other bacteria that may represent potential competitors for nutrients or space. It was also shown that the mycobacterial cell wall plays an important part in the attachment process.

Previous research has indicated that pregnant women do not meet current DHA recommendations of 200 mg per day. Much of the research has been conducted in coastal communities with greater access to marine sources and may not reflect non-coastal communities. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe maternal DHA intake in pregnant women from Southwest Montana and to determine changes in dietary DHA intake over time. METHODS: Thirty-nine participants were asked to complete a non-consecutive 3-day diet record and a DHA focused food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at weeks 18, 28 and 35 (Â± 1 week). Maternal fasted plasma and red blood cell samples were obtained via venipuncture during the same data collection periods. Fetal cord blood samples were collected at delivery. Due to time restrictions, all blood lipid parameters were undetermined. After delivery, participants completed a post-partum survey. RESULTS: Participants' overall mean (MEAN Â± SD (min. - max.)) DHA intake was 248 Â± 321 mg/d (8 - 1,836 mg/d). According to those who reported using DHA supplements in their FFQ interviews at weeks 18 (n = 12), 28 (n = 13) and 35 (n = 11), the mean DHA intake was 272 Â± 380 mg/d (147 - 1,490 mg/d). The mean DHA intake among non-supplement users at weeks 18 (n = 22), 28 (n = 20) and 35 (n = 21) was 147 Â± 139 mg/d (8 - 555 mg/d). Dietary DHA intake from weeks 18, 28 and 35 did not differ significantly (F (2, 62) = 0.220, p = 0.803). CONCLUSION: Dietary DHA intake did not differ over time. The mean dietary DHA intake for non-supplement users was below the current prenatal recommendation. Therefore, pregnant women in Southwest Montana are not meeting current DHA recommendations through dietary means alone and should consider DHA supplementation as a method to meet fetal and maternal DHA needs during pregnancy.

When people face a large amount of information on which to base a decision, common sense suggests that they should slowly and deliberatively think about that information. However, Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) suggests that a slow yet unconscious mechanism can process complex information and output decisions that rival, and perhaps exceed, the quality of decisions that result from deliberative thought (Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006). However, this idea is controversial and research into UTT reveals that an unconscious thought advantage (UTA) over conscious thinking is small and manifests unreliably (Nieuwenstein et al., 2015; Strick et al., 2011). The aim of this thesis was to identify and test a potential moderator of the UTA. Logically, situations that hinder conscious thought but leave unconscious thought relatively unaffected should enhance the UTA. The Attentional Control Theory (ACT) offers one such situation, that anxiety compromises conscious processes that rely upon attentional control and working memory (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, 2007). Because conscious thought relies heavily on working memory relative to unconscious thought, experiencing anxiety may lead the two thought processes to diverge. Specifically, anxiety should negatively influence conscious thought but not significantly influence unconscious thought. In the present study, participants viewed information about roommate candidates and made judgments after a period of either distraction or focused deliberation, while under calm or anxious conditions. Results did not support the hypothesis that the experience of anxiety would increase the UTA; participants performed comparably in the conscious thought and unconscious thought conditions. Further, participants in the conscious thought condition performed better under anxious compared to calm conditions. Exploratory analyses and future directions are discussed.

The empirical analysis uses a difference-in-difference-in-difference estimator to compare changes in labor force participation associated with the passage of state-level divorce laws, focusing on the responses of married women with children relative to married women without children. The most important new finding is that married mothers have greater labor force participation responses to no-fault divorce laws than do married non-mothers in states with such laws, even after controlling for differences in labor force participation among married women with and without children in states without no-fault divorce laws. The results suggest that the probability of being in the labor force associated with no-fault divorce law is about 5 percent higher for women with children relative to women without children.

Discourse analysis will be used as a tool to explain the existence of the variety of codes in the classroom setting: teaching code, behavioral code, student code, spoken and textual codes. This project also attempts to fill in the gap that currently exists in the scholarly discussion on teaching code-switching strategies in monolingual discursive situations. Review of literature situates the general topic in an historical context and critically analyzes the most relevant published research through summary, classification and comparison, and promotes reflexivity upon language choice in educational settings. Theoretical framework composed of the synthesis of findings in discourse analysis, ethnography of communication and critical language awareness focuses attention on classroom discourses, especially those pertaining to the analysis of written textbooks. Furthermore, the theory serves as a solid foundation for building awareness of how language functions in written texts, and it has the potential to make teachers and students more aware of the effects of code-switching techniques in a text. The third chapter applies this theoretical framework to the textbook 'Crafting Authentic Voices' by Tom Romano. This theory and its application has a potential to make contributions to the development of curriculum, pedagogy, instructional planning in the English Language Arts classrooms.

However, microbially reduced UO 2 may be susceptible to reoxidation by environmental factors, with Fe(III) (hydr)oxides playing a significant role. Little is known about the role that organic compounds such as Fe(III) chelators play in the stability of reduced U. Here we investigate the impact of DFB (desferrioxamine B), citrate, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), and NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) on biogenic UO 2 reoxidation with ferrihydrite, goethite, or hematite. Experiments were run in anaerobic batch systems in PIPES buffer (pH 7) with bicarbonate for approximately 80 days. U(VI) concentrations were measured using a kinetic phosphorescence analyzer. Results showed EDTA accelerated UO 2 reoxidation the most at an initial rate of 9.5 micron day -Â¹ according to the non-zero-order rate equation R = k 1 [chelator], with a rate constant k 1 of 0.049, 0.044, and 0.046 day -Â¹ for ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite, respectively. NTA accelerated UO 2 reoxidation with ferrihydrite at a rate of 4.8 micron day -Â¹ with k 1 = 0.026 day -Â¹; rates were less with goethite and hematite (0.66 and 0.71 micron day -Â¹ with k 1 = 0.0038 and 0.0004 day -Â¹, respectively). Citrate increased UO 2 reoxidation with ferrihydrite at a rate of 1.8 micron day -Â¹ with k 1 = 0.009 day -Â¹, but did not increase the extent of reaction, and no reoxidation occurred with goethite or hematite. DFB inhibited UO 2 reoxidation with ferrihydrite, and no reoxidation occurred with goethite or hematite. In all cases, bicarbonate increased the rate and extent of UO 2 reoxidation with ferrihydrite in the presence and absence of chelators. The highest rate of UO 2 reoxidation occurred when the chelator promoted UO 2 and Fe(III) (hydr)oxide dissolution as demonstrated with EDTA. When UO 2 dissolution did not occur, UO 2 reoxidation likely proceeded through an aqueous Fe(III) intermediate. The rate of UO 2 reoxidation was dependent on the stability constant between chelator and Fe(III), with DFB likely inhibiting reoxidation due to a very high stability constant (log K = 30.6). These results indicate that common chelators found in U contaminated sites can play a significant role in mobilizing U affecting efforts for bioremediation.

Symptoms can be mild to severe, and consist of silvery exfoliative plaques of skin. Although there are various forms of treatment, there is no cure. Existing data regarding psoriasis confirms a link between decreased quality of life and psoriasis. Subjective data regarding the disease has been documented since 1976, however, there exists a lack of qualitative nursing research regarding psoriasis. Additionally, only one study was found in which the lived experience of psoriasis patients was documented. This phenomenologic study explores three patientÎ±s lived experience with psoriasis in Montana. One on one interviews were conducted with the participants to document the experiences of living with psoriasis. Using the Roy Adaptation Model as a framework, particular emphasis is given to adaptative versus maladaptive responses. Entitled Î²lived experience statementsÎ³, quotes were taken from the interview transcripts and organized by common themes as well as individual statements. This was done, in part, due to RoyÎ±s belief that living systems are complex, and that adaptation can be an individual and dynamic response to the environment. An individualÎ±s experience, while not common among all participants, is still reflective of their adaptation to disease. Participant responses illustrate concerns of patients with psoriasis and day to day events that may occur in their lives. By becoming familiar with lived experience statements, nurses, nurse practitioners and other health care providers can develop a deeper appreciation for the impact a diagnosis of psoriasis carries. This understanding may foster holistic care for the psoriasis patient, as well as encourage the nurse to be more aware of adaptation and the nurseÎ±s role in the adaptive process.

In addition to imaging internal structures of systems, NMR microscopy techniques can be used to obtain information about transport phenomena, such as fluid velocities and diffusion. The goal of this research was to determine the applicability of NMR imaging techniques to studying transport properties in biofilms. Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were investigated because of their importance in medical implant infections. NMR experiments were used to image biofilm structure and the fluid flow patterns in one millimeter square glass capillaries. Results showing the heterogeneous structure of biofilms are congruent with confocal laser microscopy images. The advantage of using the NMR techniques to image biofilm structures is that there are no light or laser penetration barriers and the innermost regions of the structures can be easily revealed. In addition to imaging the biofilms, velocity distributions have been mapped for the one millimeter capillary system. Laminar flows in clean, square capillaries display axial velocities that are both uniform and symmetrical while non-axial components of velocity are not present. In contrast, a biofilm fouled capillary displays irregular flow patterns in the axial direction along with distinct non-axial secondary flow perturbations. These results demonstrate that biofilms impact bulk flow in ways that cannot be ignored when modeling their impact on transport in bioreactors and medial devices. This work establishes NMR microscopy as an important biofilm research tool which can spatially resolve structural characteristics and transport processes in biofilm fouled systems.

This thesis looks at music cognition, film cognition, and learning theory to argue for the importance of music in documentary films. Adhering to the theory that the documentary film genre is an educational tool first and foremost, the use of music strengthens a film's potential to engage with and educate an audience. The first portion of this thesis examines brain function as it pertains to music and learning, as well as research in narrative film cognition, looking particularly at how documentary films provide a unique medium to engage an audience in a story of facts, which increases their chances of retaining information presented to them, as well as providing a unique vehicle for repetition and variety in information transmission which contributes to a stronger learning environment. The second portion of this thesis analyses three popular science and nature documentary films in order to more fully understand their use of music, and how that may or may not have contributed to their success.

GNPs synthesized at various radiation doses were experimentally characterized and two mathematical models were developed to simulate the synthesis process. The first is based on the Finke-Watzky model and predicts the rate of soluble gold salt conversion to GNPs, and the second model is based on a population balance model and predicts nanoparticle concentration and size distribution. The model parameters that provided an optimal fit to experimentally gathered data were determined, and both models were able to capture the experimental absorbance time trends. The population balance model, however, had the greater predictive power as it was able to capture mean particle size trends that were consistent with experimental measurement.

We employ the ARMS survey data from 2003 to 2011. We construct three models with different organic status classifications. We control for differences in farm type, NASS crop district, urbanization, and year fixed effects. We find that organic certification has a significant (statistically and economically) effect on farmland value. Our model suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in a farm's organic land would result a 0.23 percentage point increase in the farmland rental rate.

In disinfectant efficacy testing, as well as in research, choosing the best reactor to use is important because different laboratory reactors impart unique characteristics in the biofilm that influence everything form biofilm architecture and protein regulation to the response of biofilm bacteria to disinfection. In this dissertation, three laboratory reactors and associated standard operating protocols were developed to provide a reliable, standardized assessment of disinfectant efficacy against biofilm bacteria that grow: 1) in a moderate to high fluid shear environment, 2) in hot tubs, and 3) in swimming pools. The reactors and protocols were then evaluated for the statistical characteristics of repeatability, ruggedness, and responsiveness, required criteria for the standardization of a method. In the CDC biofilm reactor (CBR), biofilm was engineered to possess the characteristics of a field biofilm grown under moderate to high fluid shear. The laboratory hot tub and swimming pool reactors were each engineered to generate a field-relevant biofilm by modeling the physiochemical and biological characteristics present in such recreational water. Testing demonstrated that the CBR and laboratory hot tub system were repeatable and rugged. The hot tub and swimming pool systems were responsive to disinfectant type and concentration. This research demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating relevant engineering design into practical laboratory methods used to evaluate disinfectant efficacy.

This thesis explores the history of La Ofrenda from its roots in ancient Mesoamerica to its subsequent merging with Spanish religious beliefs during the colonial Mexican period. Symbolic and ritualistic elements of La Ofrenda are examined to reflect the syncretic nature of the altar showing how it incorporates elements of both cultures. The thesis then analyzes the placement of La Ofrenda in the context of public institutions across the United States of America to discern if authentic characteristics remain when the altar is featured public venues. Each chapter addresses a different set of contrasting elements with the first chapter examining traditional aspects and materials vs. contemporary installations. Second, will consider the distinction between private and sacred displays and those featured in a public secular venue. Next, an effect on La Ofrenda by the very institutions that are trying to preserve the practice is examined with a look at contemporary artists who create highly conceptual Ofrendas reflecting the ever-changing aspects of Modern art, using a wide variety of nontraditional techniques such as computer technology, video and performance. These new methods of artistic representation are challenging and changing not only La Ofrenda, but what can be perceived as an Ofrenda. The question of the future of the display of La Ofrenda in a public setting is examined through these nontraditional altar representations and addresses the ramifications they present to the authenticity of La Ofrenda in conceptual installations.

Most prominently, it introduced new meal guidelines and nutritional requirements for school meals. Additionally, it authorized the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) that became available to schools with more than 40 percent of students who are eligible for free school meals, based on federal means-tested program participation, in ten pilot states before it was authorized nationally for school year 2014-15. Schools that opt into the provision are required to provide free breakfast and lunch to all students. While a number of studies have established that implementation of the provision leads to increased student participation in school meals, no study is known that empirically analyzes the impact on individual student outcomes. Student-level data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey- K: 2011 is merged with school-level data in six pilot states and a difference-in-difference model estimates the impact of CEP implementation on students' health, academic, and behavioral outcomes. No statistically significant effect of CEP implementation on student outcomes is identified. Additionally, no indication is found, that students who receive free or reduced-price meals before CEP implementation are impacted differently than students who paid full price for school meals is found. Thus, this analysis does not provide any evidence that CEP implementation in fact benefits individual students, either by means of participation increases or reductions in stigma and student body segmentation associated with subsidized school meals. Additionally, it is unlikely that schools gain financially from implementation of the provision. Consequently, this thesis questions that there are any significant returns on this public policy.

Presented here is a novel design of such a filter based on two subwavelength gold gratings separated by a dielectric surface relief grating. It is shown that a Fabry-Perot resonance occurs in the cavity between the gold gratings while surface plasmon polariton resonances occur at the two metal/dielectric interfaces. It is further shown that these two resonance effects couple together to create a spectral bandpass that is high and narrow enough for the remote sensing application. These resonance effects can be changed in shape and position by adjusting the width, height, period, and separation between the gold gratings. It is further observed that the surface plasmon polariton resonances also have the effect of suppressing light transmission at certain wavelengths, allowing the spectral bandpass shape to be tuned, reducing out-of-band transmission. The polarizing effect of these gratings results from the rejection of light polarized along the grating rulings, a phenomenon that is well documented to occur in subwavelength wire grids. Experimental data on prototype gratings show good agreement with predicted performance calculated using numerical rigorous-coupled wave analysis once we account for uncertainties in the material properties and device geometry due to fabrication and processing variabilities. This numerical method is used in conjunction with analytical approximations like zero-order effective medium theory to develop a design process that can be extended to any wavelength in the shortwave infrared region. All devices undergo a final global parameter optimization procedure to account for any subtle near-field effects. Finally, I present designs of three devices optimized for operation at wavelengths of 1550 nm, 1640 nm, and 1700 nm. These devices share characteristics that make them able to be simultaneously fabricated on the same substrate, a crucial step if they are to be built into an array. The final devices all have a peak transmission of greater than 80%, and spectral widths of less than 40 nm.

The research comprising this thesis uses NMR to explore biophysical, chemical, and transport properties within heterogeneous porous media systems at both a macro- and micro-scale. The macro-scale projects validate a low-field borehole NMR instrument to monitor field-scale environmental engineering applications like subsurface biofilms and microbially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP). Subsurface biofilms are central to bioremediation of chemical contaminants in soil and groundwater whereby micro-organisms degrade or sequester environmental pollutants like nitrate, hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents and heavy metals. When composed of ureolytic microbes, subsurface biofilms can also induce calcite precipitation. MICP has engineering applications that include soil stabilization and subsurface barriers, as well as sealing of cap rocks and well-bore regions for carbon dioxide sequestration. To meet the design goals of these beneficial applications, subsurface biofilms and MICP must be monitored over space and time - a challenging task with traditional methods. The low-field borehole NMR tool recorded changes in the T 2 relaxation distribution where enhanced relaxation indicated biofilm accumulation in a sand bioreactor and in subsurface soil. Additionally, the tool was able to detect MICP in a sand bioreactor. The changed mineral surface of the sand lead to an increase in T 2 relaxation times. The complementary high-field NMR project investigated micro-scale internal structures and mass transport within biofilm granules used for wastewater treatment. Granular sludge, composed of spherical aggregates of biofilm grown without a carrier, is an innovative biological treatment method with the potential to vastly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment without sacrificing efficiency. Large gaps remain, however, in our understanding of the fundamental formation mechanisms and the factors that control granule activity and stability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified heterogeneous internal structures within aerobic granular sludge where relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients vary. Ultimately, these results will help improve modeling for optimization of granular sludge wastewater treatment process design.

Many have suggested that Titus was not written by Shakespeare--or not written by him alone. In 2002, British scholar Brian Vickers presented a comprehensive study of the authorship of the play, concluding that Titus was co-written by Shakespeare and his early modern contemporary George Peele. Critical literary scholarship has not caught up with Vickers's settlement of the authorship question and there exists a lacuna in the analysis of the play, namely, for my purposes, how do the disparately authored scenes reflect sourcing influences and intratextual character development regarding revenge as a literary descendant of classical drama and as an ethical enterprise of moral agents. Shakespeare's subsequent treatments of the ethical dimensions of vengeance, as both a public and private manifestation of the quest for justice and a psychological response to injury, spawn from the complex tropology in Titus--both those he assumed from Peele and those he introduced into the text himself. A study of the moral philosophy espoused in the joint composition of Titus affords the opportunity for a deeper understanding of how early modern playwrights addressed the desire for revenge as a psychological and moral activity and how the jointly composed play launched Shakespeare's subsequent negotiation with the revenge tragedy genre and the ethos of revenge in his later revenge tragedies.

An oracle is a mechanism determine whether test results are correct according to the expected behavior of the program. Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that can be used to test such applications. This approach checks relations among multiple inputs and outputs of the program instead of checking the correctness of individual test outputs. Theses relationships are called Metamorphic Relations (MRs) and their violations indicates faults in System Under Test (SUT). Programs have several MRs with different fault detection effectiveness. Thus order in which they apply determines the efficiency of the testing process. Therefore in this work we propose a strategy to prioritize MRs based on their potential fault finding ability. Our strategy uses mutation testing to create a prioratized order of MRs for a given program. We evaluated our proposed approach using machine learning libraries in Weka as well as open source mathematical programs; these results show that our strategy is effective in developing a prioratized order of MRs that maximizes early fault detection. Our results show that in 126 methods we can detect 50.1%-100% faults using 25% of the MRs compared to a random order only detect 1.13%-100%.

The spontaneous, room-temperature crystallization of CeO 2 from mM concentrations of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) in water was studied using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Characterization of the final nanoparticles revealed polycrystalline CeO 2 nanoparticles that are stable from aggregation over a period of months. Most of the nanoparticles are between 3 and 9 nm, although a small proportion of larger particles between 10 and 150 nm were also detected. Crystallization is accompanied by a large change in absorption which can be modeled by the presence of just two species. These species are argued to be an amorphous, hydrated intermediate that is converted to nanocrystalline CeO 2 over a period of minutes to hours. The rate-limiting step of the amorphous to crystalline transition involves a proton transfer reaction, as evidenced by a solvent kinetic isotope effect of ~10. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show a drastic difference between the optical properties of the crystalline nanoparticles and the amorphous precursors. This system is an excellent model system for studying non-classical crystallization because the minutes-to-hours time scale and the small sizes of the nanoparticles and precursors allow for in situ observation of crystallization using steady-state absorption spectroscopy. This system would also lend itself well to characterization by other techniques such as liquid-cell TEM or x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), is one of the most managed solitary bees and is an important pollinator of many crops, especially alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. However, little is known about its response to insecticides, specifically pyrethroids, which are frequently used to manage populations of adult mosquitoes that inhabit the same areas. Current regulatory requirements for insecticide toxicity to non-target insects focus on one pollinator, the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., but this species does not represent all insect pollinator species in terms of response to insecticides. Therefore, we characterized the toxicity and risk of three pyrethroid insecticides (permethrin, deltamethrin, and etofenprox) on adult M. rotundata in both laboratory and field settings. The median lethal dose, LD 50, was estimated for adult M. rotundata females when exposed to each pyrethroid to serve as a baseline toxicity test to determine the susceptibility of M. rotundata to these insecticides. The range of concentrations for permethrin and etofenprox ranged from 0.0075-0.076 microgram/bee and the range for deltamethrin was 0.0014-0.0075 microgram/bee. The estimated LD 50 results for permethrin, etofenprox, and deltamethrin were 0.057, 0.051, and 0.0016 microgram/bee, respectively. After obtaining the LD 50 values, we compared female respiration rates after dosing of each LD 50 endpoint. In a field study, we applied a formulated version of each active ingredient at the maximum labeled rate of 0.017 kg/ha over an alfalfa field via ultra-low-volume (ULV) applicator and observed mortality of both adult A. mellifera and M. rotundata for 48-hr after exposure. In both species, there was no significant difference in mortality between control and treated groups for any of the formulations. In another field study, a formulated version of etofenprox was applied in an alfalfa field at the half-maximum labeled rate of 0.003 kg/ha and directly targeted to M. rotundata nests. There was no significant difference in mortality between control and treated groups. We also did not observe a significant difference in the number of adults reared between treated vs. control shelters. Results from the field studies suggest that the risk of mortality from these insecticides applied via ULV applicators may be relatively low.

Among the ways to reduce spray drift is to manipulate the physical properties of the spray solution with formulated products and tank additives, but further research is required to better understand their effects. By measuring spray drift under field conditions and using the results to estimate ecological risk, we characterize the effect on drift for two formulation types and two adjuvants. A field study was conducted where off-target ground deposition and droplet size were measured to indicate spray drift for different combinations of the formulations and adjuvants, accounting for environmental conditions. Each treatment combination was also sprayed in a wind tunnel set up to precisely measure droplet spectra so that these could be related to deposition in the field. Finally, an efficacy experiment was conducted to test for tradeoffs between drift reduction and pest control. Results from the field study suggest that as much as 32% drift reduction was achieved by selecting between the tested formulation types, and as much as 62% by incorporating certain spray adjuvants, but this effect depended on the formulation/adjuvant combination. Treatments with smaller droplet sizes had greater drift, and there was no tradeoff between drift reduction and pest control. We assessed ecological risk for terrestrial insects in non-target habitats using a novel approach to estimate insecticide residue on plant surfaces based on ground deposition data from the field study. Exposure concentrations were combined with a cumulative distribution of species sensitivities to statistically represent the risk of toxicity for the active ingredient that was used and the levels of drift that were observed. We found that substantial reductions in the percentage of insect species affected in an off-target area could be achieved by certain formulation types and adjuvants. This work could be useful for developing a classification scheme for formulated products and tank additives based on their potential for reducing spray drift and ecological risk to non-target receptors.

Since microorganisms are significant drivers of arsenic toxicity and mobility in nature, it is important to understand how microbes detect and react to arsenic. The microbial arsenic resistance operon (ars) is critical for sensing arsenic in the environment and controlling the cellular response to this toxin. The ars operon is minimally comprised of arsRBC, which codes for an ArsR transcriptional repressor, arsenite effluxer, and an arsenate reductase, respectively, with the operon negatively regulated by the transcriptional repressor, ArsR. Our model organism Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A carries two ars operons, with each containing two arsR genes. We conducted an RNASeq study to examine the regulatory roles of the encoded four ArsR regulatory proteins as a function of +/- arsenite. We report that the regulatory influence of the ArsR proteins extends well beyond the ars operon, with both activation and repression effects. In addition to the expected arsenic resistance response, many cellular functions were impacted, including: phosphate acquisition/metabolism, sugar transport, chemotaxis, copper tolerance, and iron homeostasis. Each of the ArsR proteins uniquely influenced different sets of genes and an arsR regulatory hierarchy was observed, wherein ArsR1 is auto regulatory and negatively regulates arsR4, ArsR4 activates arsR2, and ArsR2 negatively regulates arsR3. ArsR3 is the least active with respect to number of genes regulated. To summarize, this study provides a more complete understanding of how microbial gene expression and biogeochemical cycling may be influenced by arsenic in the environment.

The purpose of these explorations is to destabilize science's unquestioned hegemony and to reveal new insights on human nature. Literary theory, particularly as it relates to the novel, is shown as a tool for deconstructing and critiquing current science and science media. Defining characteristics of the novel are discussed and offered as the basis for a new model of science media. It is hoped that this new model will allow science media to both hold to its raison d'Ãªtre and successfully engage audiences.	['philology', 'authorship', 'criticism', 'literature', 'rhetoric']

In order to discover the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing lodging resistance and other important agronomic traits in pea, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was created from a relatively wide cross between the commercial variety Delta and an unnamed pea variety. The RIL population was grown for 6 site-years in Bozeman and Moccasin, MT, USA, and phenotypic data was collected for 22 quantitative morphological traits and seven categorical traits which were thought to be associated with lodging resistance. Genotypic data was derived from genotype by sequencing, microsattelite markers, and cleaved amplified sequence tagged sites. QTL analysis identified a total of 135 putative QTLs for the 22 traits examined in the study. There were 12 specific regions where 115 QTLs co-located, indicating that as few as 12 genes may be responsible for multiple pleiotropic effects. Ten QTLs were found for lodging resistance. Due to the large amount of phenotypic data collected, the putative mechanism of lodging resistance was determined for each QTL. In nearly every case, lodging resistance was associated with reduced plant height, a change in tendril number, or increased stem strength. This conclusion was supported by mathematical modeling. Branch number, which determines the number of tendrils per plant, was also positively associated with lodging resistance during all site-years, indicating that increasing tendril number also increases lodging resistance. Yield was controlled by eight QTLs. All QTLs for yield had pleiotropic effects on lodging resistance and yield per plant. Seed size was not correlated with yield, and a model was created which explained why no association between yield and seed size was found. The pleiotropic effects and utility of the QTLs discovered in this study are discussed. The results of this study further refine the ideotype for pea, and can be used for marker assisted selection in this crop.

The objective of the first study in this thesis was to determine the differences in forage quality between reduced-lignin and conventional alfalfa. To test these differences, twenty-four Crossbred Angus heifers were selected to participate in this study and their performance was evaluated based on changes in BW, ADG, DMI, and G:F. In situ digestibility was determined using four ruminally cannulated Hereford cows. Hay samples were collected and used to determine forage quality and leaf-to-stem ratio. There were no differences (P > or = 0.05) in forage quality between treatments, except for DM (P = 0.01). Means did not differ by treatment for percent leaf (P = 0.06) but did differ for leaf-to-stem ratio (P = 0.04). There were no treatment or treatment by day interactions (P > or = 0.05) for BW, ADG, DMI, or G:F. There were no treatment or treatment by time interactions (P > or = 0.05) for in situ digestibility. Overall, the results of this study suggested no difference in forage quality between reduced-lignin and conventional alfalfa. Additionally, animal performance did not differ for crossbred Angus heifers consuming reduced-lignin or conventional alfalfa. The objective of the second study in this thesis was to quantify DM and forage quality losses associated with three different methods of outdoor round bale hay storage at two different sites in Montana. Large round bales consisting of 100% grass hay wrapped in plastic net wrapping were placed into one of four storage systems at both the Bozeman Agricultural Research and Teaching farm (BART) and the Northern Agricultural Research Center (NARC). The four storage systems were: single-stack (SS), pyramid (PYR), mushroom (MSH), and inside stored bales (INSIDE). Results indicated that DM and forage quality losses differed based on geographic location in Montana. This study suggested that DM and forage quality losses differ by location and that bale placement, rather than hay storage formation, is more important for changes in DM and quality for bales stored in Montana over the winter months.

At the summit, the skis are attached together and used as a normal snowboard to ride downhill. As splitboarding has grown in popularity, manufacturers have developed splitboard-specific equipment, such as bindings and boots. This crossover study investigated the effects of highback lean settings on Spark R&D splitboard bindings and two Burton Snowboards boot models while touring uphill. Subjects toured on a treadmill at a 10% incline in four test conditions: the Driver X boot with positive lean, the Driver X boot with negative lean, the Tourist boot with positive lean, and the Tourist boot with negative lean. Lower limb muscle activity was recorded as average root-mean-square (RMS) for gluteus medius (GM), biceps femoris (BF), rectus femoris (RF), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and tibialis anterior (TA). Kinematics variables of stride length, and ankle and knee range of motion (ROM) were also measured. The effects of the boots and bindings were determined using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (alpha < 0.05). The main effect of binding on average RMS was not significant for all muscles except MG (F = 8.821, p = 0.018, f = 1.05), with the negative lean having higher average RMS than the positive lean. The main effect of boot on stride length was significant (F = 15.791, p = 0.003, f = 1.33), with the Tourist resulting in a 3.56 cm longer stride length that the Driver X. The main effect of binding on stride length was also significant (F = 9.875, p = 0.012, f = 1.05), with negative lean resulting in a 2.21 cm longer stride length than the positive lean. The main effect of boot model on ankle ROM was significant (F = 36.325, p = 0.000, f = 2.00), with the Tourist having a larger ROM than the Driver X. There were no significant effects or interactions for knee ROM. The results of this study demonstrate that boot model and binding settings can affect biomechanical and physiological variables while splitboard touring.

In response to growing water quality concerns and new regulatory requirements, a three-stage treatment wetland was recently constructed at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery to treat wastewater generated by raceway cleaning operations. Currently only the first two stages of this system are complete and over the first two months of operation have removed over 98% of influent chemical oxygen demand, 99% of total suspended solids, 59% of total nitrogen, and 95% of total phosphorus. However, the effluent phosphorus concentration is expected to increase as organic matter accumulating in the wetland mineralizes and the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the wetland media is saturated. To maintain long-term phosphorus removal, the treatment wetland was designed with a filter unit to be filled with media capable of adsorbing large quantities of phosphorus. The purpose of this research is to choose the optimal media for this filter unit, comparing three manufactured materials (lightweight aggregate, juniper biochar, and lodgepole biochar) and four natural materials (limestone, dolomite, shale, and gravel). Batch adsorption experiments were conducted with coarse media in deionized water, coarse media in Blaine Spring Creek water, and fine media in deionized water. The difference between these batch experiments showed that water chemistry and particle size significantly affect phosphorus adsorption for a given material. Based on their high performance in batch experiments, lightweight aggregate and lodgepole biochar were tested in continuous flow columns, along with gravel to provide a baseline performance comparison. Gravel and lightweight aggregate removed more phosphorus in continuous flow columns than in batch experiments, likely due to ongoing precipitation with calcium ions in the influent. Lightweight aggregate was the top performing media in all experiments, and is recommended for use in the filter units at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery treatment wetland. Based on its phosphorus removal capacity in column experiments (1200 mg P kg -1 lightweight aggregate), the filter beds will be saturated in 14 months if the current effluent phosphorus concentration of 2.3 mg L -1 is maintained.

69169	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1352	A degree day model of sheep grazing influence on alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica	Alfalfa, Medicago sativa (L.), is produced on approximately 720,000 ha in Montana and is the foremost forage crop in many high, semiarid, intermountain states. Two biological stressors (insects and weeds) combined with poor field management are primarily responsible for reduced alfalfa production. In the U.S. alone, arthropods cause an estimated $260 million loss to alfalfa with the alfalfa weevil (AW), Hypera postica Gyllenhal, being the most damaging phytophagous pest in the United States. Using degree days as predictors for initiation and cessation of arthropod IPM programs is a common practice and on-line degree day calculators using regional temperature data are providing equal accuracy as on-site estimates. Grazing is emerging as a legitimate IPM tactic however there is no published literature using degree days to implement an IPM based grazing systems. A degree day predictive model is needed, as a producer decision and support tool, to improve the effectiveness of strategic sheep grazing to manage alfalfa weevil. Grazing treatments exclosures were established in a randomized complete block design at weekly intervals giving each treatment a unique degree day and stocking rate. Degree days calculated from both on-site and near-site data produced the same model accuracy. Therefore, the near-site model was selected to encourage use by producers. Treatments meeting the selection criteria (G3, G4, G5) were 'modeled' together and a simple linear regression (P < 0.01) was calculated predicting AW larval populations based on stocking rate and degree day. Harvest sample treatment DM did not differ (P > 0.16). However, NDF, CP, and Yield differed (P < 0.01) between treatments. Due to an interaction (P < 0.01), ADF and TDN were separated by year and did not differ P = 0.93 during 2008, but did (P < 0.01) during 2009. Based on yield and nutritive differences between treatments, a simple regression (P < 0.01) of plant RGR was calculated to predict when yield and nutritive characteristics of the modeled and less extensively grazed 'alternative' (NG, G1, G2) treatments would equal. The equation predicted that producers would need to wait an average of four days for treatment harvest characteristics to equal.

The WASL measures academic performance in science using both scenario and stand-alone question types. Previous research suggests that presenting target items connected to an authentic context, like scenario question types, can increase science achievement scores especially in underrepresented groups and thus help to close the achievement gap. The purpose of this study was to identify significant differences in performance between gender and ethnic subgroups by question type on the 2005 eighth-grade science WASL. MANOVA and ANOVA were used to examine relationships between gender and ethnic subgroups as independent variables with achievement scores on scenario and stand-alone question types as dependent variables. MANOVA revealed no significant effects for gender, suggesting that the 2005 eighth-grade science WASL was gender neutral. However, there were significant effects for ethnicity. ANOVA revealed significant effects for ethnicity and ethnicity by gender interaction in both question types. Effect sizes were negligible for the ethnicity by gender interaction. Large effect sizes between ethnicities on scenario question types became moderate to small effect sizes on stand-alone question types. This indicates the score advantage the higher performing subgroups had over the lower performing subgroups was not as large on stand-alone question types compared to scenario question types. A further comparison examined performance on multiple-choice items only within both question types. Similar achievement patterns between ethnicities emerged; however, achievement patterns between genders changed in boys' favor. Scenario question types appeared to register differences between ethnic groups to a greater degree than stand-alone question types. These differences may be attributable to individual differences in cognition, characteristics of test items themselves and/or opportunities to learn. Suggestions for future research are made.

As a subjective medium rather than a representation of objective reality, film creates a convincing illusion of experience that can translate into an opportunity for vicarious learning. I examine four documentaries by directors that demonstrate an uncanny ability to communicate an experience through film, and I apply their techniques and methods to my own film on field research on tundra swans in northwestern Alaska. Filming in an empathic mode, embracing subjectivity, and giving precedence to how the film subjects' perceive their world offer the filmmaker the ability to harness the illusion of experience that film can provide.

The questions on how to read and interpret tribal narrative and modern American Indian fiction are still urgent topics that trigger numerous debates among literary scholars. What theories to employ and what approaches to use to dispel misinterpretations of the literature are still matters open to suggestion. Postmodernism, the new world trend, has influenced all spheres of life, not excluding literature. Although it does seem to better account for American Indian voices as it shifts attention to local narratives and re-evaluation of history, the issue of whether it is applicable and favorable to Native American literature and its cause is a debatable one. Postmodern theory claims to liberate the suppressed voices including those of Native Americans, but at the same time presents the danger of limiting Native American literature to another set of frames while denying it its purpose, i.e. achievement of the establishment of Native American national literature. Many American Indian scholars insist that American Indian literature should not be interpreted using mainstream approaches, such as postmodernism, since they have already done enough damage, but implementing American Indian philosophies instead, such as nationalism. It also seems premature to apply postmodern theory since it deconstructs history and identity, which are still to be constructed in Native American literature. Tribal literature and tribal realities are closely connected and, therefore, the fight for Native American literature and how to interpret it appears to be a part of a bigger fight, the one for sovereignty, both national and intellectual. The ""post"" of postmodernism, as well as the ""post"" of post-colonialism, might simply not be present for Native American literature yet and, therefore, theories offered by nationalism can at the given moment be more promising to American Indian literature and its purposes."

Because of this decline in interest and preparation in these fields, there is a shift in focus in science education to pedagogy methods that are more student-centered and allow students to engage in more authentic scientific practices. Along with declining interest, many students do not have the abstract scientific reasoning skills to be successful in upper-level coursework necessary for these fields. In order to better prepare students and keep them engaged in science coursework, methods that are both scientific inquiry based and can help students develop their scientific reasoning skills are needed. A group of students at Frenchtown High School used a scaffolded reading technique, called the CREATE method, to interpret and understand two scientific primary literature articles, and were compared to students that did not engage in the reading activities. Both groups of students took pre and posttests that measured their understanding of scientific inquiry and scientific reasoning, the treatment group's concept maps were also assessed for reading comprehension. The treatment group saw increased understanding in several areas of scientific inquiry, increased abstract thinking skills, and better reading comprehension from the first article to the second article. These results suggest that this modified CREATE method could be used as a pedagogical tool in the science classroom that would help students better understand how scientists carry out scientific inquiry and increase scientific reasoning skills.

Student interest and perceptions were positive, while gains in learning were minimal overall with unproven indications that females benefitted more than males from the flipped format. Worsening of homework submission was noted, with implications that factors other than digital submission were the cause. Students being distracted by the devices during class was noted with no definitive indicator being identified. However, improved teacher satisfaction was noted in the areas of providing feedback to students and usage of the devices for learning.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

I suspect that this is the result of inadequate direct instruction in mathematical based science reasoning skills. The goal of this project was for students to be able to use and articulate mathematical reasoning strategies when approaching scientific tasks. To accomplish this, sophomore level Biology (Genetics) curriculum was pervaded with mathematical instruction. This project investigated the effectiveness of implementing direct mathematics instruction in sophomore level Biology courses to improve mathematics based science reasoning skills at Belgrade High School in Belgrade, Montana. Students explored Genetics based Biology concepts while receiving direct instruction on statistical analysis as a tool for developing scientific reasoning skills, such as, scientific claim, evidence, and reasoning. Data collection for this project involved completion of scoring rubrics by both the student and teacher following a Genetics based laboratory exercise, as well as, a Genetics summative assessment concluding the three-week unit of study. Students were evaluated on a point scale that included: stating a claim, providing evidence, data-based reasoning, and making an argument. The results indicated that by implementing direct Mathematics instruction on standards-based Biology concepts, students gained a greater understanding of Genetics concepts and were able to develop a more thorough claim, evidence, reasoning explanation for a standard Genetics laboratory investigation.

In the flipped classroom, students receive direct instruction outside of class through videos, podcasts, or readings, and class time is freed up to design effective, engaging, and enjoyable activities and experiences. One concern with the flipped classroom is the student engagement and participation in the videos. For this project, two interactive technologies, PlayPosit and EdPuzzle, were evaluated to determine which technology would be the most effective on student achievement, student engagement, and student attitudes in the flipped classroom. Over the course of two units, Advanced Placement Chemistry students at Penn-Trafford High School watched the lecture videos in PlayPosit and EdPuzzle. The Comparison Unit using YouTube lasted two weeks. Treatment 1 using PlayPosit and Treatment 2 using EdPuzzle each lasted three weeks. Results from post-tests were analyzed and compared to determine the effect on student achievement. Student surveys and interviews were analyzed to determine the effect on student engagement and attitudes. Results revealed no significant difference in student achievement, but a significant difference in engagement when utilizing both PlayPosit and EdPuzzle. Student comments and interviews also showed that students preferred EdPuzzle to both PlayPosit and YouTube. Overall, EdPuzzle was the most effective platform for content videos in the flipped classroom.	['high school students', 'chemistry', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

Data was collected through biology assessments, questionnaires, interviews, and class observations. Two classes participated as both the treatment and comparison group for two units each. Results suggest that POGIL is an effective teaching approach when implemented correctly that can improve student performance, increase class engagement, and foster positive attitudes towards learning biology.

The students involved in the study had been enrolled in a physics class for the first half of the school that was taught using a traditional method. At the midpoint of the school year, the course transitioned to a flipped style in which students were required to watch video lectures for homework. With lecture material moved outside of the classroom, class time was devoted to practice problems and lab activities. The students' progress during the study was monitored through pre- and post-unit assessments. Data provided by the county on district quarterly assessments was used to compare students in the treatment group to their own past performance and the performance of students in previous school years. Students also completed an engagement survey and participated in interviews and written reflections. The project results indicated that students showed as increased level of engagement in certain areas. The results also indicated that students learned material through the flipped classroom as effectively as they had in a traditional classroom setting.

69183	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13649	The use of case study style questions as a means of improving academic achievement and attitude	The focal point of this action research project was to address the growing issues surrounding student attitude present in the high school science classroom. Many students struggle with connecting the science content explored in high school science classes with their personal lives and fail to make connections with real world applications. To improve student attitude an attempt was made to increase the student-content personal connection with the use of case study style questioning. Case studies, real world scenarios that demonstrate application and relevance to content being studied, have proven to be very successful in improving students' scores, attendance, and attitudes with their use at medical and professional schools. Case study style questions were drafted to be used as warm up activities for a unit on Genetics in a standard level Biology course. One class would receive the case study style questions and another would not, to act as a control group for comparison. Students who received the case study treatment showed little difference in academic achievement when compared to the control group. However, data collected from surveys and interviews demonstrated shifts in student attitudes. Students reported feeling more personally connected, comfortable, and interested in the content explored with case studies. Future work is needed to better outline the effects of case studies on academic achievement and will provide opportunities for future action research projects.

Students were provided individual accounts for G Suite and those accounts were enrolled in Schoology Learning Management System. These platforms allowed 103 students to discuss the class content with their peers, turn in assignments online, and have access to online textbooks, test preparation material, videos, and supplemental science information. In addition, students participated in technology enhanced and non-technology enhanced lessons to compare engagement behaviors and academic accomplishment in both settings. At the conclusion of the research, student academic performance improved with the blended learning environment.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent the effect of incorporating gamification principles had on a middle and high school science classroom. The effect on retention of material, the students' attitude towards science, and the impact these principles had on the teacher were included in this study. Results from this study suggest that while there was no discernable relationship between gamification and the retention of material by students, gamification principles did have a positive effect on the attitudes of the students regarding coming to class and participating in class. It was also determined that these principles had a greater impact on a middle school classroom and that for gamification to work, there needs to be a more thorough implementation of the principles which requires more commitment from the teacher.

In this study the 5E instructional model was compared with the traditional approach of the direct teach instructional method. Student assessments, surveys, and interviews were used to gauge whether the 5E instructional model aided in student ability to apply knowledge and engage in classroom experiences. Teacher observations, an engagement tally, and teacher journals were also utilized to evaluate teaching effectiveness and student learning. In this study, the role of the teacher in the classroom within these two instructional models was compared. This study indicated a slight advantage of using the 5E instructional model over direct teach, however both methods of instruction can be effective tools in classroom teaching.

This was done in Yew Chung International School in Chongqing, China. This research project found that the flipped classroom method of instruction did not have a significant effect on test scores and therefore on student learning. Results revealed that the flipped classroom does not contribute to making chemistry a more engaging and enjoyable subject for students. Results also showed that the flipped classroom did have a significant effect on instructional pacing for the chemistry class, and doubled the time students spent completing practical hands-on activities in the classroom.

However, each teacher should evaluate carefully if interactive science notebooks are the right choice for his or her classroom. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive science notebooks in one science classroom as well as student opinions on the use of interactive science notebooks. The interactive science notebooks were implemented for two and a half months. Also, students were surveyed and interviewed before and after the implementation of the interactive science notebooks. The results were then compared to the traditional classroom model that was used previously. It was determined that the students liked the interactive science notebooks. They also had a positive effect on classroom achievement as pre- and post-test results were highly consistent throughout the use of the interactive science notebooks. This consistency was not seen with the traditional classroom model.

During the treatment, students participated in presentations, labs, activities, and cooperative group assignments that dealt with STEM courses and careers. These included presenters with STEM careers coming into the classroom or meeting online to talk to the students about their STEM careers, engineering labs which the students participated in to heighten their awareness of everyday objects we use that are related to STEM, and the students working together in the classroom on STEM activities to reinforce the many aspects of STEM in our lives. All of this was done with the intense purpose to increase the female students' knowledge of STEM in order to motivate them to want to take more STEM related courses in school and to further their education into STEM related careers.

Prior to the treatment, students attended three different classes at different times. Each class had its own specific content that was not connected to any other class. At the sound of the bell, students had to stop learning about what they had previously spent ninety minutes on and begin learning something completely different. The purpose of this study was to identify what impact integrated teaching had on students. Rather than stopping their learning at the sound of the bell, students use the knowledge, they just learned in a new way to continue learning about that topic. According to observations I have made, students often struggle to transfer or connect information from one content area to another. During this research, I taught two different science units to two different sixth grade classes. One science unit was not integrated with other subjects and one science unit was integrated with other subjects. The treatment science unit was integrated with math and language arts content. Students studied about the weather or the water cycle and continued to use those topics to learn in their math class and their language arts class. Students in the control group learned math and language arts skills that did not have a science topic connected to them. Students' achievement on pre and post tests did not show observable growth. Their attitudes about science, according to a survey, also did not show an observable difference after the units. However, their ability to transfer, connect, and learn was affected, as demonstrated by their responses, which were recorded in their science notebooks about their own learning during the course of those units.

69191	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13660	The effect of the flipped classroom on achievement and engagement in a 7th grade science classroom	This paper sought to analyze the effects of the flipped classroom on achievement and engagement in a 7th grade science classroom at an International School in Shanghai, China. Student perceptions about the flipped classroom were also analyzed along with a discussion about its implications in the classroom. The study was conducted for the course of eight weeks. For four weeks (nontreatment period) three classes were exposed to the traditional instructional format where higher order thinking assignments were sent home as homework. This was followed by another four weeks (treatment period) where the higher order thinking assignments were completed during the end of the class and a flipped video was sent home as homework as an introductory to the next day's lesson. While this change may seem insignificant, it was designed to allow students more time in class to collaborate and seek out help on the higher-level learning. By watching the videos at home, time that was traditionally used to introduce the day's lesson was no longer necessary. The results revealed that the flipped classroom had a positive impact on achievement for most students - including low performing students; had a mixed impact on engagement and attitude by gender - females showed improved attitudes while males remained largely unchanged; and it was perceived as a favorable method of instruction for most students.

The purpose of this project was to investigate how developing an online field ecology course for high school students impacted my growth as a teacher. I teach at an independent high school (N=410) in the San Francisco Bay Area. Three years ago my school joined a BlendEd online consortium. I was asked to teach an online field ecology course for the program. I had no experience with virtual learning as a teacher or student at the time. Data collection for this project not only included teacher journaling and reflection, but also course and teacher surveys from my online and traditional classes, a catalogue of teaching practices, and a trans-classroom teacher survey to compare my experience and growth with other trans-teachers. (Trans-classroom teachers are teachers who teach in both online and traditional classrooms.) The results indicate that I have made changes to teaching practices since teaching online. For example, results of my gall lessons with my online and traditional groups illuminate how online teaching has inspired me to employ multiple new practices like the use of homework kits and science notebooks in my traditional classes. Additionally, developing an online ecology course required me to participate in a wide range of professional development opportunities that all of my students were able to benefit from. Finally, the results of my trans-classroom teacher survey confirm that my experiences are not unlike other trans-teachers; 88% of teachers that I surveyed indicate that their traditional teaching was somewhat or very impacted by their online teaching. After 17 years traditional teaching, I have found online teaching to be invigorating and an opportunity for reinvention.

69193	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13664	Evaluating the effect of visible thinking routines on students' awareness and conceptions of thinking and understanding in the science classroom	This classroom action research project is inspired by the belief that 'life outside of school is better characterized as a series of transfer opportunities than as a series of recall assignments to be done.'(Brookhart, 2010, p. 5) Furthermore, I believe that knowledge can only be transferred when one's level of understanding for a particular topic goes deeper than simple recall. Researching best practices on improving students' critical thinking skills that would enable them to integrate and transfer their knowledge led me to the realization that for students to have and to demonstrate a deeper level of understanding they first need to be aware of and fluent in thinking that leads to understanding. Students can accomplish a deeper level of understanding if the 'thinking' is modeled for them and the students are given opportunities to practice thinking for understanding. In order to identify what thinking for understanding looks like and when they are engaged in it, students need to make their thinking visible. To accomplish this, I model and introduce Visible Thinking Routines designed to help students become aware of and fluent in thinking that leads to deeper levels of understanding by focusing on the eight types of thinking that are vital to understanding as outlined in Making Thinking Visible (Ritchhart, Church, Morrison, 2011). I modeled and introduced six Visible Thinking Routines to my seventh grade students for a period of 14 weeks and had them complete concept maps, surveys and questionnaires to evaluate the effectiveness of the routines on their awareness and conceptions of thinking and understanding in the science classroom. The use of these Visible Thinking Routines helped students' awareness and conceptions of thinking shift from physical actions to more cognitive actions. Student thinking also shifted from simply identifying physical actions to making connections between the physical actions and the cognitive actions. Although results were positive, the treatment phase was not long enough for the students to fully comprehend the effectiveness or value of the Visible Thinking Routines on their understanding. Students were able to determine that thinking for understanding was valued in the classroom, but were unable to find value in it for themselves or value in using them in other classes. The Visible Thinking Routines and the emphasis on the thinking for understanding activities helped to establish a common cognitive language in the classroom.

The complex nature of the course along with the high level of problem solving makes the course challenging for a lot of students. In order to do well in chemistry, students need to learn a new language, love math, think often, and spend time at home practicing each day's lessons. Students therefore need to develop good study habits to ensure success in a high school chemistry course. During an 4-week window students were divided into two treatment groups. Treatment group A were given ten to fifteen minute quizzes every other day. These quizzes were valued at less than 5% of their overall grade, and their grades could be improved upon by demonstrating mastery on the unit test. The control group, B were not given access to the quizzes. The study compared the results and concluded that students who took quizzes frequently earned higher scores on the unit test and earned higher grades for the subsequent marking term.

We had to come up with a better way to steer these students through our curriculum. The best way was to allow students to move through the curriculum at their own pace and to require mastery of topics within each unit of the curriculum. We decided to utilize the mastery learning approach. To tackle this, we spoke to our Instructional Specialist to gather ideas for how to help these students who were struggling due to gaps in their knowledge. She suggested we use the mastery learning approach to better help our students get the time they need to complete our curriculum. This created a starting point from which to build our mastery framework, but also to begin my classroom research project. The project aimed to combat the negative effects we were seeing in our physics students, while still maintaining academic integrity, student learning and the requirements of the district and state curriculum. By combining self-paced instruction with frequent formative assessments, students could begin to learn where their knowledge gaps are, as well as learn skills for academic success such as time management, self-advocacy, and learning from their mistakes. It should be known that due to constraints of the school in which I was conducting research, this is only an observational study. There was no control group, or treatment group. All students in the study received the same treatment, with no non-treatment units. My research questions for this project were to evaluae how implementing mastery framework affected student performance in on-level physics classes. In order to measure this, I also had to consider how mastery would impact student performance on common formative assessments, how it impacted student perceptions of physics/science, as well as how mastery encouraged student motivation. Finally, it is also important to see how implementing mastery impacted me, as an educator.	['high school students', 'physics', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

The purpose of this study was to investigate which inquiry-based instructional strategies will effectively improve student acquisition of science content vocabulary. This action research-based classroom project was conducted at Heritage High School in Littleton, Colorado. Treatment was implemented in three freshman level physical science classes (N=87) during the months of January, February, and March 2017. Content-specific vocabulary terms were taught using traditional direct instruction and compared to vocabulary instruction using the inquiry-based strategies 5E Learning Cycle and gamification. Comparison of vocabulary pre- and post-assessments has shown that all three instructional strategies improved student vocabulary acquisition (p = 0.00), however there was not a significant difference between the three instructional strategies (p = 0.49). The 5E Learning Cycle had the highest post-test mean score, highest average normalized gains, and had the greatest decrease in standard deviation between the pre-and post-test indicating it was likely more effective than direct instruction and gamification instructional strategies. Student responses on the Student Input Survey and post-treatment interviews showed that students enjoyed the 5E Learning Cycle and gamification instructional strategies and felt that these strategies improved their motivation, engagement, and learning of content vocabulary more than direct instruction.

The project to investigate this question was conducted at Harwood Union High School, a school of about 550 students. I worked with two standard algebra-based physics classes. Two specific policies were analyzed: Checking off for completion only and collecting and grading on correctness. The effectiveness of the policies were measured by giving student quizzes based strictly on previous assigned and completed homework and tracking improvement in seven areas: identifying knowns and unknowns, equation usage, substitution skills, algebraic manipulation, calculations and concept understanding. The results of the project show that the same growth in problem solving skills was obtained whether homework was just checked off for completion or thoroughly examined for correctness. The one area that did seem to make a difference was student's understanding of physics concepts. Students seemed to put in much more thought in answering conceptual questions when they knew their work would be graded on correctness. I also surveyed the other teachers of science and math at my school to see what their homework policies were.

A need exists to improve the ability to monitor contaminants that can attach to the distribution system's interior surfaces and to obtain samples for diagnosing both the cause of a WBDO and the extent of contamination within the system. In this study, a porous media reactor colonized with a mixed-species drinking water biofilm was used to study the capture of Salmonella typhimurium as a model pathogen. Parallel reactors were operated under constant flow (CF) and constant head (CH) to compare flow-regime induced spatial variations in biofilm accumulation and the resulting pathogen capture. Parallel test reactors were operated with 0.5 mg/L supplemental carbon until the accumulation of biofilm in the CH reactor reduced the flowrate to the target sampling point (CF flowrate). Both test reactors were then inoculated with slug doses of approximately 3x109 CFU S. typhimurium. Effluent water samples were collected for five pore-volumes, followed by the destructive sampling of the reactor. Plate counts were used to enumerate S. typhimurium present in effluent samples and captured within the reactor. Cell counts in effluent samples displayed an accelerated breakthrough compared with a non-reactive tracer. Compared with uncolonized control reactors (0.13%), colonized reactors (0.96%) captured significantly more cells. Despite spatial variations in biofilm accumulation, colonized CH and CF reactors captured comparable amounts of S. typhimurium. Increasing sampling duration to twenty pore volumes demonstrated greater retention of captured cells in the colonized reactors over the control reactors. S. typhimurium transport and capture was also observed in a 0.9 mm square flowcell packed with 100 mm beads using a confocal microscope. Interception and straining were responsible for capture on clean beads while biofilm accumulation narrowed pore throats sufficiently to allow for mechanical filtration to occur. This study demonstrates that using biofilm colonized porous media may be an effective tool to capture pathogens for monitoring drinking water distribution systems.

Alternative methods such as the small-group work method of POGIL (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) and inquiry-based laboratory work have been shown to be more effective. In this classroom research study these techniques were employed with students in an effort to improve their understanding of science content. In addition, the reason why traditional methods may be less effective is explored through the lens of the work of Jean Piaget and Anton Lawson. Piaget (1972) enumerated several types of reasoning he collectively called 'formal thought'. This formal reasoning may emerge from concrete reasoning during adolescence. Whether it does or not depends in large part on an individual's experiences. The implications for teaching students who are at a concrete stage of cognitive development were explored through data collected regarding science content comprehension, the use of inquiry-based lab activities, and through interviews with students. Finally, prospects for having a direct impact on students' development of formal reasoning are discussed. The results of this study are that the majority of students in a college-preparatory chemistry classroom are in fact concrete thinkers, they require a specific, learning-cycle approach for effective instruction, and the use of such instruction does not in itself contribute directly to their development of formal reasoning abilities. As a result, the study points toward further work to incorporate elements of explicit instruction in formal reasoning skills. Previous research has demonstrated the value of such instruction both in the science classroom and beyond it and that it is in fact possible to aid most but not all students to attain this level of cognitive development.

Lecture, or direct instruction, is a very passive mode of learning for students. This study investigated whether the flipped classroom model of instruction is effective in improving student engagement and achievement in an introductory high school astronomy course. Students were surveyed and interviewed about their feelings of engagement in previous science classes as well as their feelings about the flipped classroom model. Achievement was measured using the Astronomy Diagnostic Test prior to and following the course and a comparison of the treatment semester to the previous four classes in the areas of assignments, quizzes and labs.

69201	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13673	The impact of pre-visit connectedness training for STEM role models visiting formal STEM classrooms	Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), is a popular topic in education and workforce development. Middle and high school Formal Educators often seek to increase their students' interest in STEM topics and potential STEM careers. Role models may be brought in for a visit to assist with this effort but are unlikely to have an impact if they cannot quickly form a personal connection with students during their time in the classroom. While some STEM professionals may have experience and training regarding communication in their particular field, they often do not have any training to help them successfully relate to students. For this research project, an interactive one-hour online training module was designed for role models which focused on best practices for engaging and connecting with students. To measure the impact of the training, students were given pre- and post-visit surveys which gauged their attitude regarding three factors: normality of STEM professionals (i.e., STEM professionals are normal people with normal interests and habits), leisure interest in STEM and career interest in STEM professions. The STEM area the role model represented (i.e., technology for the computer programmer and engineering for the electrical engineer) was specifically targeted in the version of the attitude survey given. Change in attitude was calculated and analyzed for statistical significance. While there were no statistically significant increases in student attitude, one statistically significant decrease was measured, which indicates role models who do not connect with students may, unfortunately, negatively impact students' attitudes towards and interest in STEM. Correlation between change in student attitudes and connection with the role model, C-score, was calculated for each role model, and slight to moderate positive values were found for almost all attitude factors. This implies that, in general, the more a role model is able to connect with a student, the greater the positive change in attitude towards STEM topics the student will experience. Strong correlation, Pearson's r=0.83, between the role model's C-Score and their level of adherence to the required and strongly recommended elements from the online training indicates that training was well designed and addressed the most critical elements for connecting with students during a single, one- to two-hour classroom visit.

This study investigated the effect of graphic organizers on the academic achievement of ninth-grade chemistry students (N = 22). Data was collected on their ability to design and use concept maps, mind maps, Vee diagrams, and Venn diagrams. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between the use of graphic organizers and students' test scores. The findings also revealed that the students were more engaged and took greater responsibility for their learning in the post-mapping period.

Student attitude and motivation was measured using a student survey, student notebook reflections, and teacher observations. Biology content knowledge was measured using pre- and post-tests, and state standardized test scores. An improvement in student attitude and motivation was observed during the inquiry activities, but no statistical difference in student content knowledge was observed between the traditional units and inquiry units on classroom tests. Students showed significant improvement on the state standardized test. Most noticeable was the improvement in the students who had previously failed to meet the state standards, with a large gain in their application of science practices.

Over the course of six weeks, ninth grade biology students were introduced to the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework to help organize and develop scientific arguments in science lab conclusions. This research included a survey and writing assessment both before and after introduction to the CER framework. The purpose of this research was to determine if the CER framework would increase the frequency that students used evidence and reasoning when making their claims. Results of this study indicate that the CER framework did increase student use of evidence and reasoning in claims. Results also indicate that the CER framework did not have an effect on student ability to use scientific principles in their reasoning.	['science', 'biology', 'life sciences']

Students were given a unit pre-test and a reflection in which they could assess their knowledge against the curriculum in a scaffolded manner. Students were surveyed before and after treatment to determine changes in student attitudes and perceptions of their abilities. Students were provided with a detailed breakdown of the curricular objectives for each question on the unit pre-test in order for them to make a study guide for themselves. It was found that there was an increase in mean score from pre-test to unit test, but performance on individual curriculum outcomes experienced extreme variation, both positive and negative. It was also found that student confidence decreased from pre-test to unit test when curriculum indicators were introduced to the students.

Four sections of students, totaling 99, were used in the study. Two sections worked for eight weeks on two curricular units using the ISN, while two sections continued using autonomous methods already in place from the previous semester. All students participated in pre- and post-testing of content objectives and constructed response items, and took a Likert survey to measure attitudinal/motivational differences between the groups. Results suggest use of the interactive science notebook led to gains in student scores on constructed response items, but significant differences in performance on the post-tests do not demonstrate increases in student achievement related to the use of the ISNs. There was also no demonstrable effect on student attitudes toward science.

In filmic and practical use, these tropes are in flux and are confusing. The position of the dog as a paradox of nature and culture and member of the contemporary inter-species family makes the decision to euthanize it ethically challenging. Non-fiction dog programming is more popular than ever and most shows employ the 'dog as human' trope. But few address at what point that trope breaks down and how to find the line between 'dog as human' and 'dog as animal' when making ethical decisions for dogs. I will prove this by describing movies like Why We Love Cats and Dogs (Ellen Goosenberg Kent 2009) that rely on removed experts to explain the how humans are similar to dogs and those like Shelter Dogs (Cynthia Wade 2003) that follow devastating moments of loss with cheery depictions of renewal. My thesis film Soul Dog instead dives into the deep emotional conflict that many of us face in a society where dogs have become surrogate for family. Using personal subjective storytelling techniques like that in Sherman's March (McElwee 1986) and quirky vox pop interviews similar to those in Gates of Heaven, (Morris 1978) I focus on the personal stories and popular wisdom that influence our actions.

The ability of students to perform metacognitive processes has been called into questioning as its use is pushed to younger grade levels. Standards based goal setting was implemented this year in Perry Middle School with mixed results. The purpose of this study was to determine if tracking formative scores helped students to accurately evaluate what they know in science, increase their motivation, and raise achievement in science. Students were evaluated on metacognition, motivation, achievement, and attendance in tutoring sessions during our earth science unit. The data suggested that student used more metacognitive processes but were not more accurate in determining what they knew and did not know. Student motivation and achievement did increase, but not substantially more than the control group. Students tracking formative data did attend more help sessions then students in the control group. However, in interviews and Goal Setting Surveys, students from the treatment group reported greater dissatisfaction with the goal tracking, rated the sheets less helpful to their learning, and reported they took too long to complete compared to the control group. Therefore, it is the determination of this study that using formative scores to track goal progress did not achieve all the goals I hoped it would, but did help my 8th grade honors science students to advance in their metacognitive processes. It is my recommendation that further studies be conducted to determine if tracking progress towards standards goals via another metacognitive strategy is more helpful.

Students read different science related materials in and out of class, as well as worked on breaking down text and vocabulary to improve comprehension of units studied in class. As students read and understood the content, they applied what they learned into relatable situations in their lives and in the world around them. By becoming better readers, students were also able to improve their written communication skills. Basic improvements on spelling and grammar were realized and individual achievements varied across the board.

As the school purchased more and more technology, the administration also cut back on our paper availability and began to limit our copies. Due to the influx of technology and the decrease in paper availability, I decided to study the efficiency and effectiveness of a paperless classroom. In my high school physics class I taught one unit traditionally, all on paper, the next unit was taught nearly paperless, with work being distributed and turned in electronically. I surveyed students about their feelings towards paper versus paperless assignments, notes, and exams. Classwork completion rates were compared between the two units. I gave a pre-test and post-test for each unit to compare achievement. I also kept a time log and teacher journal each day. Many students did not have positive attitudes towards going paperless in the beginning, but by the end, most students had a positive attitude towards the paperless classroom. The classwork completion rates showed a gain from the paper unit to the paperless unit. The test results were also better in the paperless unit. The time log showed that time spent taking out and putting away devices was saved by not having to pass out papers and transitions were quicker. The journals showed that making the switch to paperless was frustrating for both the teacher and the students at first, but the experience became more and more positive as the unit progressed. This project had a positive outcome and I will continue to head towards a nearly paperless high school physics classroom.

I believe this difficulty of recognizing science as directly connected to the real world contributes to a lack of student engagement and, as a result, low academic scores. In this study, I sought to use an instructional approach called problem-based learning, in which students learn content through solving a real-world problem. The study was conducted at a suburban high school with a majority low-income, majority minority population. This set of learners has some unique challenges, including a high percentage of English-language learners and chronic absenteeism. Although my problem-based learning group did not perform better than a group of their peers who learned through a more traditional, lecture based format, there were promising results for the performance of English-language learner students and high levels of student engagement.

69213	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13684	The impact of discrepant events on a 10th grade biology classroom	"I find that the first few minutes of class is the most critical. The students have a hard time settling in and switching their brain to the lesson at hand. If I lose them, it can take 15-20 minutes for them to become calm and focused which wastes almost half of the 47-minute class period. Students have seven classes each day so I recognize that it is hard to switch gears when you are a struggling learner. I believe their brain needs some help to engage, and engaging in a discrepant event might be the way to do that. I hope to engage the students as part of the 5E lesson cycle through the use of discrepant events. Discrepant events are designed to have an unexpected outcome, which puts the learner in a state of cognitive dissonance. An example of a discrepant event in biology class is observing osmosis in an egg. Raw eggs are decalcified in vinegar for a couple of days until the shell dissolves. The mass of two eggs is measured and recorded. One egg is placed in corn syrup and the other is placed in water. After one day, the eggs are carefully removed, massed, and the data recorded. The egg left in corn syrup becomes shriveled and the yolk is visible while the egg left in water swells and becomes taut. Students do not expect the water to leave the egg in corn syrup and enter the egg placed in water. The brain is stimulated to ask why the event happened and the learner becomes curious to explore further. The brain is set in motion down the path of knowledge acquisition. The rest of the 5E cycle is designed to bring the learner along until they reach the evaluation point. The parts of the 5E cycle are engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate. Focus Questions: The primary research question my project addressed was, ""How does the use of discrepant events impact student academic achievement in biology class?"" The first sub question I investigated was, ""Are students willing to struggle through the lesson if their brain has been engaged through a discrepant event?"" Sub question two was, ""How do discrepant events affect students' confidence?"" Finally, the third sub question was, ""What effect do discrepant events have on me as the teacher?"""

69214	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13685	Impact of close reading strategies in chemistry	Many high school students have difficulty learning content by reading -- a key component of scientific literacy -- since they often lack the skills, confidence and motivation to read expository text. This study investigated the impact of close reading strategies on reading comprehension, attitude and motivation for textbook-based reading in chemistry, and the perceived utility of reading strategies for chemistry and other subjects. Students were taught three literature-based reading strategies -- a text and visuals scanning strategy, an annotation strategy, and a writing and dialogue strategy -- that addressed the pre-reading, during-reading and post-reading stages, respectively. During each three-week treatment phase, students learned a new reading strategy, and were given three reading challenges to practice the strategy. In a final treatment phase, students used all three reading strategies in concert. Data collection instruments included the Qualitative Reading Inventory (QRI) and Classroom Assessment Techniques (CAT) to assess comprehension, the Survey of Adolescent Reading Attitudes and Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile (AMRP) for attitude and motivation, a student survey for strategy usefulness, and individual interviews and a teacher reflection journal to appraise student and teacher experiences. This study found that reading comprehension improved significantly posttreatment as measured by the QRI, with an effect size in the large range. Analysis of CAT scores showed that only the post-reading stage writing and dialogue strategy resulted in a significant increase in reading quiz scores. Though student attitude towards reading the textbook was largely unaffected, both facets of motivation measured by the AMRP -- student's self-concept as a reader and student's value of reading -- increased significantly, with a small effect size. Over 90% of students agreed or felt neutral that all of the strategies helped them read the textbook more carefully and understand the chemistry textbook better, and students reported an even preference for reading strategies. A plurality of students agreed that the strategies learned in chemistry could be applied to English and social studies and 60% of students interviewed had already applied a strategy learned in chemistry to another subject. This study confirmed the value of teaching students scientific literacy skills related to reading expository text.

Growth minded students appreciate challenges and view mistakes as opportunities to learn. The project was driven by the desire to improve student behavior and engagement in learning. In addition to seeing if students would become more growth minded, I also wanted to see if student achievement in science would increase, if students could transfer their learning about mindsets to other courses and life experiences, and I wanted to know how this would impact me as the teacher. Data sources included a Measure Your Mindset Survey, individual student interviews, student work, gradebook data, a Mindset Unit Evaluation, and a teacher reflective journal. Data from the six week treatment period was compared to data from the six week pre-treatment period and the six week post-treatment period. Students that fully participated and engaged in the mindset lessons became more growth minded. Overall grades did not improve as a result of the treatment. However, mean test scores did go up. Students reported applying what they learned about the growth mindset to other courses. In addition, students felt that having a growth mindset helped them be more compassionate to aggressive peers. The teacher saw observable improvements in student behavior and engagement as documented in the teacher journal. This made teaching more enjoyable. In addition, by learning about how to facilitate a growth mindset culture in the classroom, the teacher was able to improve her verbal and written feedback to students.

These next stewards may come from programs like the Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) in Yellowstone National Park. These individuals are from the ages of 15 - 18 and serve for one month inside the park. They work on projects that help conservation and education efforts in Yellowstone National Park while also learning and developing leadership and career skills. The two sessions of 2016 YCC enrollees (N = 60) were chosen to participate in this study focused on the impact of social media and social pressure on pro-environmental behavior. Studies have shown that this age demographic is more likely to be influenced by social media, thus this study was interested in how this influence impacted their behaviors and attitudes toward the environment and creating social change. Half of the enrollees (n = 27) were asked to create a video to post to social media in which they would pledge to help the environment. Then once the pledge was completed, they would post another video to social media challenging another individual to also perform a pro-environmental action and passing on to them a wooden pledge coin. The other half of enrollees were the comparison group and were not asked to post any social media components. Both sessions were given two sets of Likert-scale question and short-answer questionnaires six months apart to evaluate any changes in attitudes or behaviors toward the environment following their experience in the YCC. The results of this study showed that after six months of social media monitoring, no YCC enrollee posted a pledge video to social media, and only one enrollee reported passing on a pledge coin. The questionnaires confirmed these findings. Enrollees disagreed that social media was an influence, but rather they agreed that families and social networks were an influence on their behavior. They also agreed to having interest in and caring for the environment. Furthermore, the short-answer questions identified the already strong connection these teenagers had to the environment, with many stating that they often participate in many pro-environmental behaviors already, but that the YCC program increased their awareness and likelihood of doing more. Indeed, these YCC participants are the current and future stewards of our natural world, but this study found that using social media with pledge videos and pledge coins are not likely to be an effective means to encouraging others to do the same. Further research is needed to validate these findings due to the small sample sizes and complications with the questionnaire administration.

This study correlated the effectiveness of the Becoming a Successful Student Class with students interested in health science career and computer science tracks as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) field transfer programs by assessing student perception of effectiveness and then correlating that effectiveness with first semester Grade Point Average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale, along with credits attempted vs. credits successfully completed and then second semester mid-term GPA along with credits attempted. Face to face interviews with competitive entry health science program directors and division directors also gave a look at the anticipated competencies that students should have prior to acceptance into a program or transfer to a STEM school. The foundational framework of the Becoming a Successful Student applies to students that are new to the world of higher academics in order to reinforce and enhance previously learned skills in order to achieve success in future coursework. This also supports the mission of student retention by making the skills and knowledge to be successful able to be accessed by all new students. Although, initially it appears that the course had little effect on the future preparedness of students, it is important to note that at mid-term many students still have an opportunity to drop or withdraw from courses that they will not be successful in. Also, the students with grades less than 'B-' show the greatest increase in semester GPA at mid-term, suggesting that students who would not have been successful initially, obtained skills that they built on and reinforced their future success.

Flipped classroom techniques have been said to influence students' flexibility of personal time for learning, as well as academic achievement and overall course enjoyment. The purpose of this study was to identify benefits associated with the utilization of flipped classroom techniques, for both the students' and the instructor, in a college level Medical Terminology course. Data collection tools were developed to identify trends in these focus areas. During a five-week time period, flipped classroom techniques (treatment) were employed alternately with the standard lecture style, while covering four units of material. During the treatment students' watched short videos via the colleges' learning management system on their own time prior to class. This freed up class time for interactive learning with the use of engaging peer-to-peer activities, and completion of what would typically be considered homework materials. On alternate units, lecture was delivered with the standard didactic method previously employed, and homework assignments completed on their own time. If, after lecture was completed and time allowed, interactive activities were implemented during class. Results indicate no difference in student academic success between the two teaching methods. Student enjoyment of the course was markedly improved (28%), as well as increased flexibility of personal time (22%) with the treatment. Instructor benefits included an increased enjoyment of teaching, increased curriculum flexibility, and improved instructor-student relations. The instructor preparation time associated with the initial use of the treatment initially felt prohibitive, but the resulting benefits for all study subjects involved negated this.

69219	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1369	Rotavirus NSP1 is an interferon system antagonist	Rotaviruses cause severe gastroenteritis in mammals, including humans and livestock. Most rotavirus proteins have known functions, either as a mediator of virus replication or as a component of the infectious virus particle. The function of nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) was unknown. However, it has been suggested that the function of NSP1 involved interactions with cellular proteins. Using the NSP1 encoded by a bovine rotavirus as the bait protein of a yeast-two hybrid interaction trap, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was identified as an NSP1-interacting protein. Due to the importance of IRF3 in initiating an interferon response, we hypothesized that NSP1 acts to antagonize the interferon system. A comprehensive set of experiments yielded the following observations. Interferon-beta (IFNbeta) induction was blocked in wild-type, but not NSP1 null, infected cells. Expression of NSP1 in the absence of infection resulted in proteasome-mediated degradation of IRF3. A cysteine-rich zinc-binding region near the amino-terminus of all known NSP1 sequences resembles a domain found in hundreds of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Mutational analysis of the zinc-binding domain was consistent with NSP1 acting as an E3 enzyme. The NSP1 of a murine strain of rotavirus also interacted with IRF3. The NSP1 proteins encoded by the bovine and murine rotavirus strains showed low sequence homology (37% identity), which indicated that directing degradation of IRF3 may be a common property of NSP1 proteins from many different rotavirus strains. Screening of simian, bovine, and porcine rotavirus strains indicated that the porcine strain OSU was the only wild-type strain that was unable to direct IRF3 degradation. Characterization of OSU showed that this strain was able to block IFNbeta induction by antagonizing NFKB signaling, rather than IRF3 signaling. While analyzing NFKB signaling in rotavirus infected cells, we found that the F box protein, betaTrCP, of the Skp1/Cul1/F box multi-subunit E3 enzyme was targeted for degradation by OSU NSP1 and the NSP1 of a bovine rotavirus strain. Together, the results presented in this dissertation have determined that rotavirus NSP1 functions as an interferon antagonist by directing the proteasome-mediated degradation of IFNbeta induction signaling components, most likely by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.

The videos were created as a means for students to have materials that would help review content outside of the classroom. Videos showed any hands-on experiments absent students may have missed and also offered the opportunity for students to review procedures. Videos also reviewed content from class discussions, explained key concepts, and included modeling as a means of explaining concepts. The goal of the study was to look at achievement on unit tests and compare the results between when the videos were accessible and when they were not. Results of the research suggested that the inclusion of the videos had no significant impact on student achievement on unit assessments and few students accessed the videos. The students that did access the videos had favorable reviews of the content.

There were 52 students from two sections of biology involved in this study, enrolled at San Ysidro High School, San Diego, California. Students used scientific notebooks throughout the treatment unit and participated in formative assessments that gauged content knowledge. Pre- and Post-tests were given for both non-treatment and treatment units and scores from the treatment tests were compared to notebook rubric scores.

The students chose their fields of study and the primary topics they intended to investigate. The topics extended beyond the school's science and mathematics curriculum, thus, the students were pursuing these courses for enrichment purposes. Five instruments were used to measure how much students were interacting with the MOOC and the value of the MOOC in terms of learning: pre-course interviews, post-course interviews, mid-course surveys, post-course surveys, and the Brief Electricity & Magnetism Assessment concept inventory. When considering the primary research question, ""What impact can MOOCs have in high school independent-study enrichment courses?"", there is evidence in this case study to suggest that MOOCs can have a positive impact, therefore, can be used to guide and support students seeking such enrichment opportunities."

Instructors are always searching for strategies to help students perform better. One such strategy is cooperative learning groups. In this classroom research project, cooperative groups were employed to determine what effect they would have upon student understanding of chemistry concepts, and thus student confidence, student attitude towards science, and individual achievement. Students were assigned to heterogeneous groups based on their algebra grades. Surveys, teacher observations and test scores were used to determine the effect the cooperative groups had during a stoichiometry unit. Students self-reported an increase in understanding; test scores showed a significant increase from pretest to posttest; but, student attitude towards science remained unchanged after the unit was completed.

This study examined the use of self-paced mastery learning units in a high school academic physical science class. Following a grid of learning opportunities, students progressed to new learning objectives only after reaching 80% mastery on their current learning objectives. Data was collected to determine the interventions' effect on student achievement, engagement and self-efficacy. Medium to large academic learning gains were reported using the mastery learning interventions. Survey data indicated that students had a more difficult time paying attention while working through units with mastery learning grids, and that class was not as easy after the interventions. Some felt more challenged. Student self-efficacy increased, as they became more confident accessing resources for help. Implications for further research include testing the method at the beginning of the school year, adjusting the incorporation of hands-on activities in the mastery learning format, and using the strategy for a few select concepts as opposed to a full unit.

Visual data includes graphs, tables, charts, and diagrams. Traditionally, students receive instruction and practice using visual data literacy skills repeatedly in elementary school, middle school, and high school. This is a challenging skill set, as it requires scientific logical thinking and interpretation of abstract information. Students practice and grow as they continue through school, but continually seem to struggle to achieve mastery of visual data literacy. This project investigated how to improve student understanding, analysis, and use of visual data by focusing on a weekly treatment of Interpreting the Graph. Each week students focused on a piece of visual data that related to current class curriculum. Students worked in lab groups to understand and analyze the data. Class discussion allowed students to share their thoughts and discuss areas that were hard to understand. Data collected for this project included a student survey before the treatment process that assessed student perception of their own abilities and skill in visual data literacy. Students then took a pretest with data literacy questions using graphs, tables, charts, and diagrams. Each week for six weeks students filled out an Interpreting the Graph student worksheet. Each week students also recorded their weekly progress and overall class progress in a graphing packet. At the end of the six week treatment process students took a posttest. Students filled out a student survey about their growth and confidence in data literacy skills through the project, and a selection of students were interviewed about their growth in visual data literacy skills. The intervention seemed to show a positive impact on student learning and abilities. Students showed a 16.7% gain between pretest and posttest assessments. Through the course of the six week intervention, students showed an increase in confidence in visual data literacy skills, as well as showing improvement on the posttest assessment. Students improved their abilities to identify independent and dependent variables of an experiment. However, students showed limited growth in their ability to explain theoretical experimental methods used to create visual data seen in class, and in their ability to write explanations for patterns in visual data using numerical evidence from the data. The key findings showed that students seemed to benefit from learning a methodical analysis procedure to work through interpreting visual data. Students also benefited from participating in regular class discussion about visual data as it pertains to the curriculum. These findings were used in continued discussion with students to help them focus on their own learning. The methods from the intervention were used in curriculum planning to change how visual data analysis was taught in Earth and Space Science classes in future years and shared with other secondary science classes to increase student skill in visual data interpretation and analysis within our school district.

But how can students develop good questioning skills? This study sought to explore how to develop good questioning skills in my middle school students by implementing the Question Formulation Technique (QFT), and examining how this training affected their ability to comprehend readings and answer open-ended questions. Two groups of students were included in the study, with one group participating in the QFT process throughout one unit of study, and the other group proceeding with traditional teacher-developed questions. Through comparisons between pre- and post-assessments, interviews, observations, surveys, and written assignments, instruction on question generation was found to improve the quality of students' questions, as well as improve their confidence in asking questions.

Authentically assessing student performance is a controversial issue and SBG is no exception. While initially transitioning to SGB may seem easy, it actually requires a radical shift in thinking by the teacher. In order for SBG to be successful a teacher must construct a way to allow students to show growth and allow them to learn at their own pace. Giving a grade value to student assessments doesn't require much change, but the idea and weight of a zero percent needs to be reevaluated. Throughout the research process it was found that students who utilized the SGB system did perform better on a final exam as compared to previous classes that were taught under a more traditional system. Student opinion on grades also changed throughout the research period. Students realized that the more concepts they can accurately demonstrate, the higher their overall grade becomes. This gave students a measurable system to achieve the grade that they wanted.	['high school students', 'physics', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

The focus is on completing the lab itself and it is difficult to get them to draw connections to the concepts and use the scientific language in their conclusion writing. This classroom research project investigated whether explicitly teaching a conclusion writing framework increased students' capability to draw conclusions from the lab work as well as increase their understandings of the concepts. The claim-evidence-reasoning framework was used to teach the students conclusion writing protocol and help analyze data. After the framework was introduced, the students practiced with it. Then it was integrated into daily activities, like labs and journal check-ins. Data collection methods included lab reports, journals, conclusion practice, surveys, interviews, and a pre/post assessment. The data collection methods were aimed at determining if students' ability to analyze data and provide appropriate scientific reasoning improved, along with gauging their attitudes towards learning and understanding of the scientific concepts. There was no strong connection found between the use of the framework and students' ability to understand the concepts. The use of the framework did improve students' ability to make a claim and use evidence within conclusion writing, but the students' still struggled with the reasoning section. There was a shift towards students feeling more capable of using evidence and reasoning in their conclusion writing, but this did not translate to student confidence in conclusion writing.

69230	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/13701	The effect of model-based inquiry teaching on student engagement, and the NGSS science practices in high school biology	The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have raised the bar of science education for teachers and students. The three stranded format of Disciplinary Core Ideas, Crosscutting Concepts, and Science Practices will require students to think and engage more deeply in the process of science. Achieving these rigorous standards for all students will require a greater level of motivation and engagement than I currently have in my classes. The purpose of this study is to investigate how model-based inquiry teaching, based on the framework of Ambitious Science Teaching, increases student motivation and engagement as well as how this framework improves student skills with the NGSS science practices. A model-based inquiry approach to science teaching emphasizes the skills and practices of scientists. During the treatment, students made an initial model to try to explain a scientific phenomenon. Classroom discourse and experiences formed the foundation of instruction, which was then used by students to revise their models. Data was collected through student surveys, and direct observations of student engagement and classroom discourse. Additionally, data was collected on students' ability to support a claim with evidence and reasoning. The results show that the treatment promoted engagement and that student skills in discourse and argumentation increased. However, students' perception of their motivation and engagement did not change with continued treatment. This study shows that model-based inquiry has significant value for students who have historic academic struggles as it moves science beyond the rote memorization that they struggle with, to explaining what is happening based on experimental evidence and personal experience.

To many, note-taking is a requirement that involves filling notebook pages with content on which they will eventually be assessed. In a day and age where science educators are shifting their instruction from lecture to more inquiry or problem-based learning, note-taking remains an important skill and instructional tool in the science classroom. The focus of this action research project was to determine how various note-taking methods influenced students in a high school freshman biology classroom. My research questions focused on student learning and achievement, student friendliness within the classroom, and student friendliness outside the classroom. Students were assigned one of four different methods to use during lecture for one content unit while data was collected through surveys, assessments, observations, and student interviews. Results showed that while the method of note-taking had little to no impact on student learning, digital and digital, outlined notes were the least student-friendly in and out of the classroom.

In the spring of 2017, the Nearpod application was incorporated and used to present lectures in a section of 11th grade biology class that was one-to-one with iPads. Embedded in each Nearpod presentation were multiple choice and free response questions that periodically checked for student understanding. Students answered these questions directly on their devices before proceeding to the next part of the lecture. Scores on chapter tests were compared to the previous year's class, which did not have iPad technology. It was found that the use of Nearpod did not have any significant impact on student test scores or levels of engagement in class.

These ESL students or English language learners (ELL) have a more difficult time learning academic language compared to their native English speaking peers. The Sheltered Instructional Observational Protocol (SIOP) was developed to help ESL students succeed in classes taught in a second language. Studies have shown SIOP as an effective means of instruction for ESL, and that following SIOP in the classroom is also successful in increasing student success among non-ESL students. This paper focuses on the effects of implementing one specific feature of SIOP (setting language objectives) in a technology education elective. In this classroom research project, the instructor implemented language objectives into alternating units of study and measured the effect of the language objectives on students' perception of content, students' peer engagement, students' confidence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and students' interest in STEM careers. The researcher collected data from student assessment, student journals, surveys, classroom observations and student interviews. This classroom research project found that when working independently on design activities, students performed better when language objectives were implemented. Language objectives led to more peer-to-peer interaction, and a drastic increase in peer-to-peer questions. By setting language objectives, students became more confident in their abilities to learn STEM concepts, however, interested in STEM careers remained constant	['handicraft', 'engineering', 'science', 'occupations', 'industrial arts', 'technology']

Further research has shown that inquiry based tutorial methods result in greater conceptual understanding by students. Additionally, tutorial methods have been shown to also improve student attitudes and motivations about physics. Problem solving has long been notoriously difficult to teach. Through the use of tutorials, many students learn physics concepts more intuitively. Often referred to as interactive engagement, or inquiry methods, tutorials help the students teach themselves about the science involved in physical phenomena. Using engineering principles to teach physics promises to add to the efforts of physics education research. Symbolic problem solutions allow the students to understand the relationship between the variables in the physical system, and the affects they have. Graphical analysis helps the students visualize the problems, the interactions involved, and the solutions meaning. Optimization, either using calculus techniques, or qualitative analysis of advantages and disadvantages, allow the student to see the behavior of the system when tailored to fit design constraints. The tutorials used in this study were designed to incrementally build an intuitive understanding of engineering components such as capacitors, solenoids, achromatic lenses, structures, or dynamic systems. Each step was built on the previous problem to show a logical progression. Tutorials were developed symbolically. Study of the symbolic formula helped the student answer conceptual questions about the system. Solutions were finally solved quantitatively using realistic numbers to show true orders of magnitude. Symbolic equations were then analyzed for optimization through calculus or qualitative means. Sometimes multiple solutions were possible and creativity was necessary.

As a dual enrollment, environmental studies high school science magnet, my students are required to take six science credits beyond FL's state minimum to satisfy curriculum demands. In response to this, my upperclassmen have expressed fatigue and a growing disinterest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) courses. Recognizing the need for promotion of enthusiasm in STEM, the purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of professional science involvement on my 11th and 12th grade honors bioscience students. I hypothesized that through participation in real-world science, students would be able to see the relevance behind their instruction and change their attitudes toward STEM courses and careers. Treatment in this study consisted of student participation in a citizen science project, Growing Beyond Earth (GBE), offered by David Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Agency (NASA). GBE was a competition-based exploration of NASA's veggie unit that gave students a chance to submit their findings to project organizers to be evaluated for implementation on the International Space Station (ISS). As a part of GBE, students built and maintained a plant atrium that mimicked conditions on the ISS during a 90-day growth trial. Students were responsible for monitoring plant health and watering regimes, managing biometric data both digitally and paper-based, harvesting plant tissues, and synthesizing research proposals from their work. Contact time for GBE varied based on the activity and is broken down in the accompanying logic model (See Table 2). Student attitudes, academic performance and retention in STEM were evaluated in response to treatment. Attitudes were measured using the Professional Science Impact Instrument (PSII), academic performance through the Science Concept Quiz (SCC), and STEM career retention was measured through the Student Interest Inventory (SII). I developed all instruments for the purpose of evaluation in this action research project and they do not pull from previously existing instruments. Analysis of the SCC returned statistically significant learning gains posttreatment, while results of the PSII and the SII were mixed.

Many unmineable coal beds contain CBM produced by native microbial communities. Enhancing the microbial processes for coal-to-methane conversion can increase the rates of CBM production and the amount of extractable natural gas in these coal beds. Strategies for enhancing microbially-produced CBM must be logistically attainable and economically practical. The goal of this dissertation work was to determine a feasible methane enhancement strategy using organic amendments to increase microbial coal-to-methane conversion. Four organic amendments were tested in coal-containing batch microcosms. Increased coal-to-methane conversion was demonstrated with small amounts of amendment addition, and all four tested amendments increased methane production similarly. Subsequent amendment addition produced smaller amounts of additional methane which appeared to be primarily due to amendment-to-methane conversion. 13 C-labeled algal and yeast amendments were used in coal systems for tracking carbon for methane production. It was shown that <22% of the amendment carbon was converted to methane. By tracking amendment carbon, it became clear that carbon sources besides coal and amendment are utilized for methane production; these carbon sources potentially include organic and inorganic carbon in the formation water and inoculum. Amendment strategies tested in batch systems were scaled up and applied to column reactors. Methane production from coal increased with small amounts of 13 C-labeled algal amendment addition. However, unlike in batch experiments, methane production rates in the column flow reactors did not slow or cease after 60-90 days, and methane was still being produced after 176 days when the study was terminated.

Now, not only can a structure's geometry be designed, composite materials offer the engineer the ability to design the layup of the material and, in turn, control some of its structural properties. While this feature of composite materials is appealing, it also poses issues for all processes involved in its design. One of the primary issues is that characterization of these materials in different orientations is often difficult and expensive. Due to composite materials' anisotropy, heterogeneity, and variability, their constitutive and damage behavior remain poorly understood. Often due to this misunderstanding, designs that use composite materials undergo a lengthy, difficult, and expensive procedures to produce the final product. Part of these procedures is the finite element modeling and simulation of designed components which requires accurate material response data. As modeling capabilities improve, provided the proper material damage response modeling data, damage models offer the ability to predict the damage response of designs. The ability to accurately predict damage responses in structures is a primary contributor to a design's development time and its overall success. In this study, multiaxial testing via the Montana State University In-Plane Loader was performed on two carbon fiber epoxy prepreg material systems. This testing was performed to determine the usefulness of digital image correlation and multiaxial testing as a means of characterizing composite materials' damage responses and to produce data capable of informing and validating damage models. The combination of digital image correlation and multiaxial testing provided dense experimental results that may prove useful to qualitatively and quantitatively inform, validate, and enhance computer finite element modeling and analysis.

If improved student understanding through the use of graphing calculators is a goal of the curriculum and if the use of graphing calculators as recommended by the Principles and Standards (NCTM, 2000) is truly valued, but graphing calculators are not integrated into assessments, then this fact demonstrates a lack of alignment of the curriculum. The researcher analyzed and compared the extent and quality of graphing calculator use in formal assessments that accompany three thirdyear textbooks used in NSF-funded curricula and that accompany seven Algebra 2 textbooks used in non-NSF-funded curricula. Quantitative data were collected using a rubric constructed by the researcher. The rubric was constructed based on Senk, Beckmann, and ThompsonÎ±s (1997) coding scheme and the recommendations of the Principles and Standards (NCTM, 2000). In addition, the researcher examined the use of graphing calculator technology in the textbooksÎ± instructional materials that support the formal assessments. The study demonstrated that the issue of analyzing and comparing curricula on the extent and quality of graphing calculator use in formal assessments is very complex with many factors involved. Results of the study raised many questions, including Î²What is meant by a Standards-based use of graphing calculators?Î³ The researcher found differences in the extent and quality of graphing calculator use between the ten curricula examined. Regarding the use of graphing calculators, the goals and assessments were in found to be in general alignment for the ten curricula. The extent and quality of graphing calculator use was also generally aligned between the textbooks and their formal assessments, with some inconsistencies associated with the quality of use.

NMR microscopy is used to obtain information about internal structures and transport properties in porous materials and opaque systems. Controlling dispersion within restricted pore spaces is of importance in a variety of applications including soil consolidation and dewatering and electromigration of solutes. NMR pulsed gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) techniques combined with electroosmotic flow (EOF) are used to study diffusion and dispersion coefficients in model glass bead packs. The results show that significant EOF-induced backflow can cause structural changes and alter the flow. Understanding the transport of liquids in porous materials during the application of electrical field holds promise for solving problems involving the delivery of binding agents to infill the pore space in rigid cement-based structures via electroosmosis. NMR PGSTE techniques and micro-CT scan imaging were used to study fluid transport and structural changes in a hydrating cement paste in a closed cell. It is shown that EOF in closed cement paste samples caused a significant increase in macroscopic void volume compared to closed samples with no flow. Needleless connectors (NCs) are commonly used medical devices with complicated internal design that leads to flow complexity that may cause undesirable bacterial deposition and biofilm formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is applied to acquire spatial velocity maps of fluid flow at various positions within the devices. MRI velocimetry is demonstrated as an effective method to quantify flow patterns and fluid dynamic dependence on structural features of NCs. Alginate and alginate-based materials find an increasing interest in environmental engineering as adsorbents for heavy metal recovery from aqueous solutions. A Ca 2+ and Cu 2+ containing fluid flow through calcium-based alginate gel has been visualized using NMR velocimetry. NMR indicated velocity changes in gel capillaries caused by ion exchange processes and followed gel structural changes. NMR microscopy is shown as an effective method to describe fluid transport and internal structural features in opaque porous systems and medical devices.

Agriculture in the northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America has undergone a tillage reduction revolution over the past 20 years; it is therefore imperative to elucidate how organic matter (OM) and fertilizer-N cycle under no-till (NT) management given its potential for providing more sustainable cropping systems and mitigating environmental losses. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize the cycling of labile, reactive pools of soil organic C and N among NT wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based cropping systems subjected to differing cropping intensity and fertilizer-N management. We conducted both laboratory and field experiments following the fate of 15 N-labelled fertilizer as affected by N management principles. In surface soil, microbial uptake of NH 4+ was greater than for NO 3- forms. Lower immobilization of NO 3- might therefore increase fertilizer-N availability to winter wheat relative to NH 4+ or urea-based sources. In plant tissue, fertilizer-N recovery (FNR) by winter wheat was affected by application timing of urea to the soil surface; FNR was greater for spring than late-fall and winter applications. The addition of urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide improved FNR of all urea timings, but the response was greater for late-fall and winter compared with spring applications. We also examined the cycling of labile, reactive OM as affected by differing land management. Specifically, we characterized dissolved organic matter (DOM) and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) concentration and composition from soil samples collected from three long-term (>10 yr) cropping field sites. Annual NT cropping increased the concentration and compositional diversity of DOM and POXC pools; higher inputs of biomass-C promoted the accumulation of fresh, plant derived DOM relative to conventional fallow-wheat management. Such enrichment translated into higher OM accretion rates within the uppermost 0-50 cm layer, likely benefiting FNR by winter wheat.

Assets such as beef cows are subject to stochastic elements that affect the cull/replacement decision. Stochastic elements include events such as death, infertility, and the inability to meet specific performance standards. Observations suggest that many Montana ranchers use a period-by-period cull/replacement decision-making strategy. However, varying management practices, stochastic elements, and the lengthy biological process associated with cattle production limit the validity of a single long-run replacement policy applied across all cattle ranches. This thesis examines a long-run optimal replacement policy based on economic criterion that individual cattle ranchers can adapt to their specific operation. Burt's discrete time model for optimal replacement under stochastic conditions is used as the analytical model. Published data measuring the likelihood of stochastic events, Billings, Montana cattle prices, and the long-run average variable costs from a case study of an individual ranch in Eastern Montana are used in the empirical model. Prices and costs are varied to reflect varying cattle prices over time and the heterogeneous nature of management practices with respect to costs. The results indicate that, although a single optimal planned replacement age is not derived, voluntary replacement should occur between cow ages of six and eleven years. These results are insensitive to varying price/cost combinations used in the study. Given the insensitivity of the results to the varying price/cost levels it is likely that the probabilities measuring the stochastic events are the main determinants in deriving an optimal replacement age. The results also show that cattle ranching is profitable except in high cost with average to below average model price conditions.

Specialization and repetition as modes of production allow me to model the structures which modern societies are built upon. The objects, which are miniature cinderblocks, are extruded, cut, stacked, fired and assembled as structures with the blocks serving as markers of commodity. We are living in a time in which the practices required to support our current standards of living are in question, from concerns with sustainability to workers rights. Through this process I gain insight into contemporary practices of production. Viewer participation provides the opportunity for the work to transform from a marker of commodity to an object with a value of use for the consumer.

Dinosaur fossils have been recovered from North America for over 150 years, yet the stratigraphy of the localities from which they were collected has rarely been analysed at high resolution, either due to lack of original locality data, or that precise correlation between depositional basins was not technologically possible. This dissertation analyses what effect the introduction of high-resolution chronostratigraphic data has on our understanding of dinosaur paleobiology. Terrestrial sequence stratigraphy was used in combination with previously published data in order to subdivide the uppermost Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation of Montana into lower, middle, and upper units, shown to be consistent across the formation type area. Similar stratigraphic data was gathered for each of the Late Cretaceous dinosaur-bearing formations of the North American Western Interior, which was combined with nearly 200 radiometric dates (newly recalibrated here) to plot a comprehensive high-resolution correlation chart. The stratigraphic occurrence of dinosaur taxa was consequently plotted upon this chart. Similarly, the new Hell Creek Formation stratigraphic framework was used to plot the stratigraphic occurrence of Triceratops fossils. From this it can be seen that many dinosaur groups form stacks of stratigraphically separated species, a pattern indicative of linear, non-branching evolution (anagenesis). A similar pattern is observed for two new taxa of chasmosaurine ceratopsid (horned) dinosaurs from New Mexico, which form morphologic and stratigraphic intermediates between the slightly older taxon, Pentaceratops, and the younger Anchiceratops. Phylogenetic and geometric morphometric analysis supports the hypothesis that the posterior embayment of the parietal deepens and closes in on itself over ~ 2 million years from Pentaceratops through the new taxa, to Anchiceratops, and suggests a deep split within Chasmosaurinae that occurs before the Middle Campanian. These findings imply that dinosaur evolution in the Late Cretaceous Western Interior was characterized mostly by anagenesis, punctuated by occasional speciation events, perhaps triggered by high sealevel creating a north / south geographic barrier. The evolutionary process of reinforcement is discussed as a possible mechanism for the development of cranial display organs, linked to speciation.

Metabolites are constantly being transformed inside a cell in direct response to stimuli around them. This makes the metabolome the most dynamic of all the omics fields and is considered to be a direct readout of the cells state at any given time. Although highly informative, the metabolome is inherently difficult to study, with thousands of known metabolites, any of which could be important for classifying a cell into a healthy or diseased state. Techniques such as mass spectrometry are well suited to study the metabolome and have been used to successfully classify cells by identify markers for a given disease state. However, current methods require lengthy analysis times due in part to the complexity of the metabolome. The research presented in this dissertation highlights a new and promising methodology which improves classification and speeds marker discovery. Making use of a protein found in animals which has evolved to selectively bind metabolites, an assay was developed which better classified samples compared to current methods used in the field of metabolomics. This improved classification was achieved with an overall decrease in analysis time. The implementation of this method in the study of complex biological systems would have an immediate impact in academic and medical research.

As a highly specialized, tourism-dependent gateway community, the National Park Service's management decisions that affect park visitation also impact the economic viability of West Yellowstone. Previously, scholars have documented the challenges presented by tourism economies and 'resortification' in small communities, the process of a small town being converted into a resort destination with numerous vacation properties, increasing absentee business ownership, a highly seasonal economy and escalating real estate prices. Less is known about how the challenges of resortification and industrial tourism interact with the dimensions of community resilience within a gateway community. Community resilience exists as a mechanism for rural and remote communities to identify vulnerabilities, buffer change, develop resources and promote local progress during periods of uncertainty and stress. This paper explores how the snowmobiling restrictions and winter use management of Yellowstone National Park impacted the community resilience of the tourism-dependent gateway community of West Yellowstone. The debate over winter use management and snowmobiling restrictions in Yellowstone National Park drained the community resources of West Yellowstone and negatively impacted the economic viability of local wintertime businesses. Consequently, challenges of resortification intensified and diminished several dimensions of West Yellowstone's community resilience. The mixed methods approach provides insight to how West Yellowstone's social and economic well-being have been affected since the snowmobiling restrictions were implemented and how the tourism landscape of the entire Yellowstone region has changed. The case study of West Yellowstone contributes knowledge of the economics of gateway communities, the implications of federal land management decisions, and the community resilience of tourism-dependent, gateway towns.

In Senegal, harvesting grains and crop residue from the land impact heavily on soil carbon content, while the insufficient replacement of soil nutrients with fertilizers contributes to negative nutrient balances. Given the economic perspective of the rational farmer and the dynamic nature of crop and soil management issues, this thesis used a regional case study in the Groundnut Basin of Senegal to do the following: describe and assess economic incentives specific the to the case study region; model the farmer's production and decision making process; design carbon contract policies and model them within the farmer's decision making process; simulate the interaction between the current agricultural marketplace and potential carbon policies; and to assess the role that carbon sequestration could play in helping the region deal with soil degradation problems, if and when international action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Information from farmers in the region indicates that several factors constrain fertilizer use, including financial constraints and market imperfections. The result of these constraints is to reduce the productivity and increase the farm gate cost of fertilizers. The results of the simulation supported this hypothesis. Using data from the Groundnut Basin in Senegal, and employing an econometric-process simulation model, this study found that some carbon contracts could be used to reduce losses in soil carbon and productivity; however, only at high carbon prices ($180 USD/t carbon and higher). Transactions costs, the additional labor costs associated with residue incorporation, and groundnut residues prices all strongly influenced the results of the carbon contract policies, particularly where carbon prices are less than $100/t.

Currently, the United States healthcare system is considered the most expensive in the world; 53% per capita more than the second-highest country. This study was focused on increasing resource productivity and efficiency in the healthcare system specifically at Bozeman Deaconess Cancer Center (BDCC) taking into consideration mental workload. The demand of the center has increased in approximately 16% each year since 2011. The BDCC strategic objectives are to improve the distribution and supply of resources, to maximize service coverage, to minimize waiting time of patients, and maximize service capacity. This research measured and validated mental workload in the infusion area of BDCC using two perceptual tools, NASA-TLX and SWAT, as well physiological responses. The purpose is to balance patient appointment and increase resource utilization. This study took into consideration the balance of human resource workload as a main part of the proposed model rather than only a mathematical solution balancing the capacity of the human resources without overloading them. A mathematical model was be developed and tested through a discrete event simulation to validate and explore the feasibility of the scheduling polices. In conclusion this thesis was able to successfully build a patient scheduling model considering nurses workload. It was proved that the model balanced patient appointments through the day by leveling the workload of nurses and pharmacists. Sensitivity analysis showed that the patient demand of the center could be increased up to 40% in some instances without negatively impacting patient service. This research is one of the first of its kind to include mental workload as a mathematical constraint in a scheduling model.	['time management', 'scheduling', 'management']

Adverse weather conditions also present a considerable challenge, both in terms of safety and operations. All these problems along with the increasingly limited resources for infrastructure expansion have urged transportation agencies to investigate innovative traffic management approaches. One of these approaches is the use of Active Traffic Management (ATM) strategies. Within ATM, the practice of Variable Speed Limit (VSL) systems is well suited to improving safety and operations. These systems dynamically utilize real-time traffic and/or weather data to post appropriate speeds that are thought to improve safety and operations along a corridor. The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the benefits of a recently installed advisory VSL system along OR-217 freeway in Portland, Oregon. This corridor is characterized by high traffic levels, severe congestion and unreliable travel times. The congestion of the freeway contribute to crash rates exceeding the statewide averages for this type of facility. Pacific Northwest's unpredictable climate presents another challenge that doubles the congestion and safety problems along the corridor. The effectiveness of this system was explored through an in-depth 'before and after' and 'on-and-off' analyses. The study was designed in a way that it encompasses both the safety and mobility benefits of the system. Besides, driver compliance with the system was also measured under different scenarios. The results indicated that the system had significant impacts on both mobility and safety. In terms of mobility it was found that system had lowered the average speeds along the corridor. The advisory VSL activation also resulted in reduced capacities. Safety assessment of the system suggested that, VSL has decreased crash rates and temporal and lateral variations of speed. Under certain scenarios, the system also decreased the longitudinal variations of speed. Further, it was also found that due to the advisory nature of the system, the majority of drivers do not comply with the system. However, VSL has resulted in reducing the percentage of aggressive drivers and have increased the number of drivers complying the static speed limit.

Such barriers include the membrane-bound organelles but also a suite of protein-based compartments that architecturally and chemically integrate catalytic processes. These compartments co-polymerize from multiple protein subunits to form polyhedral structures that spatially separate enzymatic processes. Protein compartments confine volatile intermediates, trap toxic reaction products, and co-localize multiple enzymatic processes for catalytic enhancements. The protein-based compartments represent, advantageously, a combination of form and function that has inspired the synthesis of new, designer materials. The self-assembly of cage-like structures, the structures of which are reminiscent of the compartments, has been used for the directed encapsulation of active enzymes. We have used the capsid from bacteriophage P22, as a nanocontainer for directing the encapsulation of a variety of gene products, including active enzymes. The P22 capsid assembles from a coat protein (CP) and a scaffold protein (SP) which templates its assembly. Using the simplicity of the P22 expression system, a strategy was developed and implemented for the directed encapsulation of an active, [NiFe] hydrogenase. We hypothesized and proved the enzyme active site needed to be matured by accessory proteins found within the expression host. A two plasmid expression system was designed, where the hydrogenase cargo was under the control of a different inducer than the P22 CP. The [NiFe]-hydrogenase is a heterodimer and each enzyme subunit was fused to different SP. The resultant packaging of the two SP fusions, with the hydrogenase large and small subunits fused to them stabilized a weak heterodimeric structure. Remarkably, the stabilizing effects of the capsid allowed us to probe the infrared signatures associated with the hydrogenase active site. Finally, the progress made here in developing a virus capsid for H2 production left room to build increased complexity into the P22-Hydrogenase system while also taking inspiration from the innate, biological function of the hydrogenase. We incorporated a cytochrome/cytochrome reductase pair to drive H 2 production using NADH. These designs, built at the molecular level, represent inherently renewable catalysts that pave the way for a new era of catalytic materials synthesized entirely by biology.

To evaluate performance of modern treatment wetland designs with respect to carbon and nitrogen removal in Montana and other challenging contexts, a two-stage, vertical flow system with recycle capabilities has been constructed and tested at a ski area near Bozeman, Montana. Site climatic and operational conditions provide a 'worst-case' scenario to test the efficacy of treatment wetlands in Montana. Intensive sampling of influent and effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen containing compounds after the second season of plant growth is used to optimize and correlate performance as influenced by loading rate, dose volume, and recycle ratio. COD removal was greater than 90% and increased linearly with loading rate even when loading rate exceeded European design guidelines by nearly a factor of 10, with effluent concentrations approximately 100 mgÂ·L -1. The system was also able to nitrify and denitrify. With the use of water recycling, effluent could be optimized for complete removal of ammonium and total nitrogen removal around 50%, even though influent concentrations were approximately 4 times greater than typical domestic wastewater. Mass removal rates were as high as 20 g-NÂ·m-2Â·day -1, higher than expected based on European guidelines. These results indicate that treatment wetlands are capable of high nitrogen and organic carbon removal, even when applied at a high concentrations, low temperatures, and variable flow situations.

Despite of the key role of microbes on Earth, microbial community characteristics are not explicitly part of climate models because our understanding of their responses to long-term environmental and climatic processes is limited. In this study, I developed a Flow Cytometric protocol to access a long-term record of non-photosynthetic prokaryotic cell concentration archived in the West Antarctic Ice-Sheet (WAIS; chapter 2). The WD ice core was retrieved between 2009 and 2011 to a depth of 3,405 m, extending back to 68,000 before 1950. Once a 17,400 year-record of prokaryotic cell concentration was acquired, I investigated its temporal variability and patterns, determined the potential sources of prokaryotic cells between the Last Glacial Maximum and the early Holocene, and assessed the environmental factors that might have the largest influence on the prokaryotic response (chapter 3). The observed patterns in the prokaryotic record are linked to large-scale controls of the Southern Ocean and West Antarctica Ice-Sheet. The main research findings presented here about the first prokaryotic record are: (i) airborne prokaryotic cell concentration does respond to long-term climatic and environmental processes, (ii) the processes of deglaciation, sea level rise and sea-ice fluctuation were key; the abundance of prokaryotic cells covariate with ssNa and black carbon, and (iii) the prokaryotic cell record variate on millennial time scale with cycles of 1,490-years. In addition, I studied 'congelation ice' (i.e., ice forms as liquid water freezes) from ice-covered lakes to understand prokaryotic cell segregation between liquid and solid phases during the physical freezing process. Five mesocosm experiments were designed to understand prokaryotic responses to the progressive freezing in concert with field observations from ice-covered lakes from Barrow, Alaska. As a result of this last study (chapter 4), I concluded that prokaryotic cells are preferentially incorporated in the ice with segregation coefficients (K eff) between 0.8 - 4.4, which are higher than for major ions. Prokaryotic cells avoid rejection more effectively from the ice matrix.	['life sciences', 'ecology', 'environmental sciences', 'biology', 'science']

The major objective of my research was to examine the impact of environmentally imposed energetic constraints on nutrient cycling in mirobially-dominated systems. I used three ice-covered aquatic environments as natural laboratories for my investigations. The permanently ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MCM) are located in Victoria Land, East Antarctica. The MCM have been studied intensively as part of the McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research Project since 1993. My work built on the extensive MCM dataset via high-throughput DNA sequencing to examine microbial communities from all three domains of life during the transition to winter, and by quantifying rates of dark inorganic carbon-fixation. This worked showed the importance of flexible metabolisms in the microbial ecosystems of the MCM lakes. The ocean beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) is the gateway between the Ross Sea and the dark ocean of the Ross Ice Shelf cavity. The area supports a biological carbon pump that is important in ocean biogeochemistry. Ice shelves around Antarctica are under threat of collapse, but little is known about the ecosystems beneath them. My work used a combination of biogeochemical measurements and assessment of microbial community structure to characterize the ecosystem beneath the MIS and its connections to the open ocean. The data showed the importance of nutrients advected from open water to the MIS cavity and projected an organic carbon deficit farther from the ice shelf edge. Subglacial Lake Whillans lies 800 m beneath the surface of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet near the end of a hydrological continuum that terminates in the ocean beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Primarily through the use of biogeochemical rate measurements and determinations of organic matter quantity and quality, this work established the presence of an active microbial ecosystem in the subglacial lake, and estimated the annual subglacial flux of carbon and nutrients to the ocean under the ice shelf. Together, these projects show the importance of microbial activity in regional biogeochemical processes and of metabolic flexibility under energy-limited conditions.

The imaging system has a physical limit to the resolution dictated by the diffraction limited resolution. This limit can be improved by making the aperture larger on the imaging system. The increase in the physical aperture size can only be practical to a certain extent. However, to get beyond these physical constraints it is possible to use synthetic aperture methods to allow for the aperture to appear to be increased. Synthetic apertures are created by adding apertures coherently together to create a larger aperture that increases the diffraction limited resolution. To sum the aperture coherently the phase information needs to be available. One way to have access to the phase information is to capture the image as hologram. These holograms are captured by using a coherent light source with a reference beam to create an interference pattern that contains the phase information of the target. Holographic apertures can be used in a synthetic aperture method called Holographic Aperture Lidar (HAL). A problem that can arise while capturing images is turbulence in the atmosphere. Turbulence is a change in the index of refraction caused by a change in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere. This causes the phase of the light to distort dynamically as it propagates making HAL imaging difficult. This thesis will cover a method to restore the original phase of the signal that has passed through turbulence so that it can be used in digital holography and HAL. This method uses averaging of the phase gradient to remove the dynamic turbulence and keep the phase information of the static target. The improvements observed in actual experiments were small, but the basics of the method worked, and the reason for only small improvement are discussed.

The use of these VOCs to inhibit or kill a wide range of microorganisms is termed mycofumigation. This dissertation focuses on parameters of MA mycofumigation including: production and bioactivity of previously un-described water-soluble antimicrobial compounds produced by MA; distribution of antimicrobial compounds from a MA point source in three soil types as measured by effects on Verticillium dahliae and Colletotrichum coccodes; control of V. dahliae and C. coccodes on potato; the ability of MA to colonize soil; and the effects of mycofumigation on ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) in vitro and on the colonization of onion roots by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices. The bioactivity of water-soluble compounds produced in potato dextrose broth was significantly increased as measured in growth reduction of C. coccodes, V. dahliae, and Rhizoctonia solani. No reduction was observed for Aphanomyces cochlioides and Pythium ultimum. Antimicrobial compounds from a MA colonized barley point source reduced V. dahliae and C. coccodes populations in soils by 60-100% at distances up to 9 cm from the inoculation source depending on soil type. Mortality rate ranging from 70-100% was observed within a 3 cm radius from the inoculation source. In both field and greenhouse trials, MA colonized barley formulation reduced Verticillium wilt and black dot root rot severity and reduced populations of both pathogens in potato tissue as measured by real-time quantitative PCR and serial dilution. Planting directly into mycofumigated soil previously infested with V. dahliae or C. coccodes resulted in equal control of the pathogens when compared to a one-week mycofumigation period prior to planting. After six weeks of incubation MA did not colonize sterile soil further than 0.5 cm away from a MA inoculation point. In vitro experiments showed that most of the tested EMF were inhibited in the presence of MA VOCs, but were able to resume growth when removed from VOCs. Incorporating MA into soil had no negative but supportive effect on onion root colonization by the AM fungus G. intraradices.

Based upon Aristotle's Rhetoric, there are two types of proof: inartistic and artistic. I argue that there is an inherent truth claim to archival footage based on its indexical bond to the historical event it captures and suspends in time, which gives the footage merit as evidence. However, evidence alone is not absolute truth. All evidence is subject to interpretation and argument. Once archival footage is placed into the larger context of a documentary film to support or refute an argument about a particular historical event, it becomes artistic proof. I use examples such as the Zapruder and Holliday footage to demonstrate inartistic proof (the truth claim of footage), and the compilation films of Emile de Antonio and Esther Shub to demonstrate the use of Aristotle's three types of artistic proof: ethical, emotional, and demonstrative. The final section of this essay discusses my film, The Great Ocean of Truth, which is a compilation film, and its use of context to create meaning, and the importance of both inartistic and artistic proofs in documentary rhetoric.

Problem solving is an important part of real-world application and many students have not acquired the essential skills to work through complex problems that they may encounter everywhere. Student interviews, teacher and student surveys, prelab and postlab assessments, and journal writings were analyzed to determine an improvement of student understanding through the implementation of the DRUFAS problem-solving strategy. As a result of integrating DRUFAS an increased proficiency in answering complex problems occurred in a high school chemistry classroom.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Web-based collaboration on students' essential inquiry skills and understanding of genetic concepts. The effects on critical thinking, student involvement, and teacher attitudes were also determined. This project considered the effects of using a Wikispaces platform in an introductory biology class at a small rural high school in Northwest, Colorado. Students content understanding and inquiry skills was assessed using pre and postunit assessments, student interviews, and collaborative projects. Students' critical thinking skills was measured through their ability to express with triggering, exploration, integration, and resolution on class posters and discussion post utilizing the Community of Inquiry Framework. Student involvement was determined through the use of teacher observations, student interviews, post on class posters, and Wiki projects. Results indicated that although students initially struggled using a Web-based platform, increases were achieved in concept understanding and critical thinking, while involvement had mixed results. The overall development of collaborative Web-based inquiry improved my teaching attitude and strengthened my ability to lead and conduct inquiry investigations.

For films intending to create social impact, emerging guides and resources can steer the production to effectively reach target audiences and measure the film's influence. Using The End of the Line, Girl Rising, and Bully as case studies, I posit that the increased analysis of a film's influence can guide the creative process to craft a more successful and targeted project, when success is defined as an actionable change. Specifically for films exploring polarized issues, new research from the Cultural Cognition Project suggests audiences are more willing to incorporate differing views when perspectives are presented in a way that allows them to grow identity, rather than challenge and demonize firmly held beliefs. I will apply the identified techniques to shape my creative process and measure the impact of my film, Red Wolf Revival, with the goal of depolarizing a contentious wildlife debate, increasing cultural cognition regarding red wolf recovery program in North Carolina, and motivating audiences to communicate their stances to decision-makers.

Previously, a signal processing deconvolution algorithm had been developed that enabled faster chirping, such that the chirp rate 'K' could be much greater than the desired resolution bandwidth (RBW). This broke past conventional limits for spectroscopic detection, which states that one needs to dwell on a spectral feature of width gamma for a time 1/gamma. For a chirp, this would mean that the square root of the chirp rate would need to be less than the RBW. For chirp rates on the order of gamma 2 or higher, nonlinearities begin to appear in detected signals depending on optical absorption depth, the chirp rate, and burned hole depths. Even with this algorithm, distortions still persist when very deep holes are burned in a high absorbing material, while the chirp rate is still very high. However, resolving spectral features under these conditions is desirable to increase the dynamic range of the SA. A new nonlinear signal processing technique that removes the nonlinearity has been developed, recovering the distorted signals. It was applied to RF signals spectrally absorbed in two different Tm 3+: YAG crystals, with measured absorption lengths of 1.9 and 2.5. The new algorithm is shown to work on multiple spectral holes simultaneously. Signals as wide as 1 MHz and as small as 300 kHz were recovered for a chirp rate of about 11.88 MHz/microsecond. These results show that very fast chirp rates could be used for highly absorbing materials, with deeply burned spectral holes. This could enable ultra-sensitive readout of a spectrum spanning hundreds of gigahertz, while pushing the dynamic range higher.

The objective of the first study was to quantify serum trace mineral concentrations in weaned ram lambs, with particular emphasis on Se and Zn. Serum samples (n = 221) were collected from ram lambs at 21 ranches throughout Montana and analyzed for Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se, and Zn concentrations. Additionally, water samples were analyzed for pertinent characteristics. Of ranches surveyed, only 67% provided a complete mineral supplement. Sheep that were provided supplementary trace mineral had greater serum Se concentrations (P < 0.001). Based on serum trace mineral concentration reference ranges, the two most commonly deficient and marginally deficient minerals across Montana were Se (19 and 23.8% of ranches, respectively) and Zn (9.5 and 57.1%, respectively). Of ranches sampled, 40 and 35% of water samples exceeded excessive concentrations in Na and sulfates, respectively. This regional knowledge of serum trace mineral concentrations in a sample of ram lambs can provide information for ranches to evaluate current and future mineral supplementation needs, as well as aid the feed industry in designing formulations for mineral premixes. Based on these results, a second study was designed with the objective to evaluate the effects of dietary Zn source and concentration on serum Zn status, growth performance, wool traits, and reproductive characteristics of developing yearling rams. Forty-four Targhee rams were used in an 84-d completely randomized design and were fed one of three pelleted dietary treatments: 1) a control diet without fortified Zn; 2) a diet fortified with a Zn amino acid complex (ZnAA); and 3) a diet fortified with ZnSO4. Serum samples were collected from each ram at four time periods to quantify serum Zn and testosterone concentrations. ZnSO4 had greater (P < or = 0.03) serum Zn concentrations compared to other treatments. Rams consuming ZnAA had greater (P < or = 0.03) average daily gain than rams in the other treatments. Wool regrowth was greater (P < 0.001) in the ZnSO4 treatment group compared to control. These results indicate that source and concentration of a Zn supplement appears to affect ram development.

Current generation optical networks consist largely of point-to-point electronically transmitted links which switch between nodes and repeaters. There is a trend in optical networking to move from the current generation opaque networks toward transparent networks. Transparent networks use only optical devices, eliminating the costly need for OEO conversions. Unfortunately, transparent networks present a unique challenge in maintaining acceptable signal quality levels. This research is an investigation of RWA algorithms in transparent optical networks. We present RAPTOR, a custom built discrete event program to simulate optical networks. RAPTOR uses its physically aware modules to accurately calculate three of the dominant physical impairments. RAPTOR is fast and multi-threaded. We introduce several new performance metrics. RAPTOR enables us to study transparent optical networks in a unique and realistic manner. We conduct an extensive performance analysis of existing RWA algorithms. We explore many different traffic models, traffic loads, signal quality, and network topologies in a comprehensive fashion. We directly compare the leading RWA algorithms in a manner has not been done before. We studied new RWA algorithms in two fields: Dynamic Programming and Ant Colony Optimization. Our new Dynamic Programming based algorithm has the best overall performance in most scenarios. It is flexible and adapts well to all network conditions we studied. It shows good promise for future optical networks.	['optics', 'physics', 'science', 'physical sciences']

Using a long-term mark-recapture dataset from a population of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, I investigated three processes related to population dynamics: environmental correlates of reproduction, sources of variation in maternal allocation to offspring, and sources of variation in the vital rates of adult females. First, I assessed the strength of the association between primary production in the McMurdo Sound and Ross Sea polynyas and the number of pups born in Erebus Bay. I demonstrated both a strong coupling between trophic levels and a surprising timing in the relationship. Pup numbers were most strongly associated with primary production in the months after birth, consistent with a response by mothers to take advantage of the environment of relative abundance. Second, I showed that the patterns of maternal allocation to offspring differ in the prenatal and post-parturition periods. Maternal and pup masses at parturition increased with maternal age (maximum near age 16) prior to declining for older animals, consistent with both restraint and senescence. In contrast, maternal allocation to offspring continued to increase with maternal age during the post-parturition period. Together, these patterns are strong evidence for terminal allocation. Furthermore, I found extensive among-individual heterogeneity, such that some mothers consistently produce heavier pups and allocate more resources during lactation. Finally, I assessed the sources of variation in the vital rates of adult females, using a multistate model to jointly estimate the probabilities of survival and reproduction. Survival rates steadily declined with age, consistent with the onset of senescence at the age of first reproduction, whereas reproductive rates increased for young animals to a maximum 8 years after the age of first reproduction before exhibiting a senescent decline. I found extensive among-individual and yearly variation in reproductive rates, coupled to minimal variation in survival rates. This dissertation adds novel information to the understanding of the complex demography of Weddell seals by revealing an association between trophic levels and patterns of variation in both the allocation of resources to offspring as well as vital rates of adult females. Together, these results shed further light on the flexible life-history patterns of a long-lived marine mammal.

The macroscopic and continuum approaches used for analysis require a degree of empiricism and theoretical assumptions. Pore-scale models drive out the need for empiricism and theoretical assumptions but cannot be validated due the lack of accurate pore-scale experimental methods. This thesis presents a novel method that utilizes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques to map the pore scale melt fraction and velocities within packed beds, non-invasively. An initial experiment was conducted where heated Nitrogen was flowed through a packed bed filled with PCMs. The increasing signal intensities due to the melting of these PCMs were captured using a 1H tuned coil. Another experiment was conducted where heated Fluorinert was flowed through a packed bed filled with PCMs. The melt front of the PCMs and the velocity of the Fluorinert was imaged using a 1 H/19 F dual tuned coil. Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) was used for the generation of randomly packed beds that mimic the experimental packed beds. These numerical packed beds were modelled under the same inlet conditions as in experimental work to yield models that showed similarities to the processes seen in experimental results. Numerical work analyzed the effects of particle size and geometry on flow, heat transfer and pore structure. Three models were developed: a packed bed of monodisperse spheres, a bed of spherical particles with a Gaussian distribution in diameters and a bed of non-spherical particles with a Gaussian distribution in diameters. It was concluded that the beds of spherical and non-spherical particles with a Gaussian distribution in diameters yielded the best complementary results to the experimental work. These numerical models and the experimental work yielded maximum velocities in the range of 6 mm/s to 8 mm/s, while showing similar attributes such as intra-particle melt gradients, preferential flow pathways and channeling effect. Experimental work shows a melt front of 60 mm in 41 minutes while models yielded a melt front of 18 mm in the same time.

Application of herbicides traditionally consists of uniform application across fields, even though weed locations can be spatially variable within a field. The concept of spot spraying seeks to reduce farmers' costs and chemical inputs to the environment by only applying herbicides to infested areas. Current spot spraying technology relies on broad spectral bands with limited ability to differentiate weed species from crops. Hyperspectral remote sensing (many narrow, contiguous spectral bands) has been shown in previous research to successfully distinguish weeds from other vegetation. Hyperspectral sensor technology, however, might not currently be practical for on-tractor applications. The research objectives were to determine (1) the utility of using a limited number of narrow spectral bands as compared to a full set of hyperspectral bands and (2) the relative accuracy of narrow spectral bands compared to wider spectral bands. Answers to these objectives have the potential for improving on-tractor weed detection sensors. Reference data was provided by field observations of 224 weed infested and 304 uninfested locations within two winter wheat fields in Gallatin County, Montana, USA. Airborne hyperspectral data collected concurrently with the reference data provided 6-nm spectral bands that were used in varying combinations and artificially widened to address the research objectives. Band selection was compared using Euclidean, divergence, transformed divergence, and Jefferies-Matusita signature separability measures. Certain three and four narrow band combinations produced accuracies with no statistical difference from the full set of hyperspectral bands (based on kappa statistic analysis, alpha = 0.05). Bands that were artificially widened to 96 nm also showed no statistically significant difference from the use of 6-nm bands for both all bands and select band combinations. Results indicate the potential for bands that can differentiate weed species from crops and that the narrowest spectral bands available might not be necessary for accurate classification. Further research is needed to determine the robustness of this analysis, including whether a single set of spectral bands can be used effectively across multiple crop/weed systems, or whether band selection is site or system specific.

With the shifting attitudes among modern audiences towards documentaries claim to present truth, puppetry an artistic medium that celebrates the subjectivity of documentaries and provides a fresh way to engage with a film. In this paper, I examine two well-known examples of motion pictures that feature puppets: 'Creature Comforts' and 'Sesame Street'. Puppetry gives filmmakers a unique opportunity to illuminate complex subjects in an understandable way, harness and take advantage of the humor and subtext within a story, and is an innovated way to represent reality in the documentary genre. My film, 'The Power of Play', is meant to engage audiences through the playful presence of puppets, and highlight why humans love watching other people play to the degree sports fandom has become in modern times. Puppetry and sports seem to have always been part of human culture, so we should take the time to enjoy, understand and celebrate their unique power and presence in the world.

This two-year field study examined edaphic and agronomic implications of cool- vs warm-season cover cropping, with and without grazing, compared to the grower standard practice of chemical-fallow. After one year of cover cropping/grazing, Olsen-P and acid phosphatase activity were higher in cover cropped/grazed treatments than the fallow treatment. Potentially mineralizable Nitrogen was higher in spray-terminated cover crop treatments than graze-terminated treatments, while soil Nitrate-N was statistically lower in cover cropped/grazed treatments than in the fallow treatment. Wheat yields were not statistically different between cover cropped/grazed and the fallow treatments; however, the fallow treatment had higher wheat seed protein than cover cropped/grazed treatments. This research also utilized the Land Suitability Analysis approach to examine four exemplary Montana counties for: 1) warm-season cover crop adoption; 2) integrated crop-livestock adoption; and, 3) warm-season cover crop use as forage in an integrated crop-livestock adoption. Fergus and Fallon Co.'s both contain portions of land highly suitable for warm-season cover crop production, while all four counties have areas where integrated crop-livestock systems appear to be a logistical possibility. The conclusions taken from this research - both the agricultural field experiment and land suitability analysis - will help inform land managers across Montana's agricultural community about these emerging practices in sustainable agriculture.

Conventional oil and gas development and the disposal of produced water has led to the contamination of 15-37 billion gallons of groundwater within the aquifer that had historically been the only source of drinking water for reservation community members. Although the tribes are aware of the contamination plume, exploiting newly accessible shale resources has become a viable option as the tribes continue to try to alleviate the high unemployment and poverty rates of tribal members. Even so, tribal members and authorities also understand the importance of ecological health in fostering a healthy community. A strong movement of cultural resurgence has been in motion, with tribal members looking to traditional stories and lessons in order to guide the future of the community and create community cohesion. Traditional knowledge systems (TKS) have been heralded throughout contemporary Indigenous governance literature as an important dynamic resource for indigenous communities that deal with difficult decisions involving resource management. Using a TKS framework and interviews with tribal members, this research seeks to answer the following questions: 1) What are the TKS that surrounds water and its use for the Nakona and Dakota tribes? 2) What are some of the opportunities and barriers that exist for the successful incorporation of TKS into tribal water governance structures at Fort Peck? Challenges to validity, process, and relevance due to political histories and power imbalances, as well as diverse intertribal knowledge systems, may impede the successful integration of Indigenous knowledge in collaborative water governance initiatives with outside interests. The internal knowledge sharing process has the potential to enhance cultural revitalization efforts on the reservation -- which represent an organic solution that takes place from within the community itself. In addition, TKS-based tribal policies may uphold the expression of tribal self-determination, i.e. the 'governance-value' of traditional knowledge systems.

Low retention and completion rates make achieving this mission difficult. This qualitative case study explored the Students Using Core Completion to Excel with Support Strategies (SUCCESS) program, a retention improvement initiative developed at a small, two-year college in Montana. The program was offered during the 2016-2017 academic year in a trial phase to determine which parts of the program were most effective. This research project sought to understand the program through the experience of the four major groups of participants: students, faculty, staff, and administration. From a pragmatic perspective, the goal was gaining understanding to inform efforts to modify and improve future versions of the program. Initial categorization of data examined the benefits, challenges, and recommendations for improvement of the program; as well as participants' thoughts on reasons for leaving or staying in school. Analysis showed that offering accelerated courses, scheduling courses in an efficient manner, and providing a mechanism for students to form relationships were major benefits to participating in the program. Faculty, staff, and administration also saw the value of the process as an opportunity to try new things and to develop relationships with peers across campus. Communication and lack of developed policies were highlighted as the biggest challenges, but were also offered with specific recommendations as areas for improvement.

The purpose of the current study is to explore how task technology fit constructs relate to the other constructs that comprise Davis' Technology Acceptance mode. The technology acceptance model is widely used as an indicator of actual use of a technology system. A sample of 284 instructors completed a survey consisting of demographic questions, open ended questions about their reasons for choosing to choose to utilize a learning management system, and Likert scale questions about six constructs of the research model including task technology fit, ease of use, usefulness, attitude, intent to use, and actual use. The relationships between TAM model constructs and Task Technology Fit were analyzed using a partial least squares structural equation model method with SMART- PLS. The relationship between task technology fit and actual use was mediated by ease of use, usefulness, attitude, and intent to use. To evaluate the constructs in the model, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted and the factor structure for online and face-to-face instructors were different. Two models were developed, one for face-to-face instructors, and one for online instructors to account for this difference. The research models were evaluated for face-to-face instructors and online instructors. The study found significant relationships between all the TAM constructs and Task Technology Fit for face-to-face instructors. The relationship between attitude and intent to use was not significant for online instructors. This research supports the need for more research into the differences between online and face-to-face instructor's perceptions of technology use. The differing instructional needs of face-to-face and online instructors have implications on the training and support an institution should provide to increase usage of learning management systems.

The left-brain interpreter portion of the human brain relates experience to the conscious mind through storytelling. Stories play an integral role in understanding how to navigate our world. The brain's self-censoring executive functioning operates on the stories we tell ourselves. Metacognitive awareness can result in the mind releasing from storytelling to find a place between stories. This experience is familiar to all of us who have come out of a movie theater to find ourselves caught between the story of an engaging movie and the story of our own lives. I call these experiences between stories epistory intervals. Epistory intervals can be rejuvenating breaks from the authority of thought. Installation art is an adaptable platform that can allow for the exploration of a variety of mental states because of its exploratory nature, self-reflective capacity and lens of inquiry.

Several connected problems are considered in different stages of this research project: 1) optimal decision making of generation companies in wholesale markets, 2) demand response and energy pricing in retail markets, 3) single and multiple microgrid power management within the retail sector, and 4) introducing a resiliency-aware power management for microgrid-based distribution systems. Hence, this work addresses the challenges that are connected to the economics of energy. All of these problems are concerned with optimizing the behavior of the participants in electricity markets (in wholesale and retail sectors) to achieve certain objectives in power system operation (e.g., profit maximization, peak shaving, resiliency improvement, extreme event awareness and preparedness, etc.). Solution concepts from the fields of machine learning and game theory have been employed to address these problems. Moreover, distributed agent-based frameworks are designed for modeling the interactive decision making processes and implementing control laws in electricity markets. The goal is to introduce automated 'intelligent' decision making capabilities into power systems to improve the efficiency of grid operation. This is closely related to the concept of 'smart grids'. The proposed solution strategies are verified through numerical simulations in MATLAB environment. The results demonstrate that using the proposed distributed decision tools and machine-learning-based techniques we can improve the performance of power systems to achieve higher levels of controllability and efficiency, while enhancing system resiliency.

Because of its importance, and our students' struggles, writing's place in education has risen to the forefront, leading to more rigorous writing standards and assessment in correspondence with the English Language Arts Common Core State Standards. Thus, this mixed methods study was designed to analyze Montana's middle school Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) English Language writing scores to understand patterns of proficiency in writing across schools and student demographics (gender and socioeconomic status). In part one of the study, quantitative data were analyzed from the 2015-2016 school year and included scores from 338 schools serving grades 6-8 with a total of 29,091 students. In alignment with current literature, findings suggest that Montana's middle school students' of low socioeconomic status, on average, perform lower than their peers on the writing portion of the standardized test. In part two of the study, qualitative data were gathered from a Montana middle school where students achieved proficiency on the Smarter Balanced Assessment English Language Arts Performance Task, to examine the way writing instruction is approached in the school. Engestrom's Activity Theory (1987) was used as a framework to describe the system of teacher instruction used to improve students' writing. Findings illuminate the complex facets of writing instruction from the lens of Activity Theory and provide practical applications for administrators and teachers in navigating a dynamic learning system.

In streams with thermal regimes that are too warm to support native biota, increasing shading or hyporheic exchange have largely been thought of as interchangeable management strategies because they influence summertime stream channel temperatures in similar ways. But, shading and hyporheic exchange operate via different mechanisms and influence stream temperature differently at differently times of the year. To understand daily and seasonal differences of shading and hyporheic exchange on stream channel temperature we used a process-based heat-budget model of channel temperature. Our model incorporates stream channel-atmospheric energy exchanges and a novel channel-subsurface heat exchange model that more appropriately represents the effects of hyporheic residence time distributions. We used our model to conduct an in silico experiment where we vary shading and hyporheic exchange on the same stream reach. In summer, the cooling and damping of channel temperatures associated with an expansive, coarse-grained hyporheic zone were similar to shading effects. However, the differences between shading and hyporheic exchange effects were most pronounced in the winter when channel warming associated with hyporheic exchange was substantially greater than warming associated with shade. By interpreting the changes in heat fluxes between shading a stream and adding hyporheic exchange, we find that shading acts as a thermal insulator and hyporheic exchange acts as a thermal capacitor. Our results show that shading and hyporheic exchange can have similar and differently effects on stream channel temperatures depending on what part of the year the effects are investigated, which has important management and modeling implications. Geography and geomorphic context of a stream are important considerations when choosing shading or hyporheic exchange for thermal restoration. In bedrock-confined streams that historically had closed canopies, shading has the greatest potential to reduce summer temperatures while restoration of hyporheic restoration is impractical in these systems. In contrast, in large, coarse-grained alluvial stream reaches, where riparian vegetation is historically sparse, restoring hyporheic influences has the greatest potential for reducing summer temperatures while increasing streamside shading is likely unattainable.

To conduct this study, I used a case study approach with four elementary teachers. Each teacher participated in professional development on mathematical modeling prior to the study and incorporated mathematical modeling into their classroom. Modeling task lessons were observed and teachers participated in interviews before and after each lesson. I qualitatively explored what mathematical decisions teachers made while teaching mathematical modeling and how students' mathematical contributions influenced the modeling cycle. This analysis took place through three analytical lenses: the mathematics used, the teacher's interactions with their student's mathematical ideas, and as compared to components of the mathematical modeling cycle. Findings indicate that students engaged in meaningful mathematics to explore real-world problems. Across all cases, teachers prepared students to use mathematics by creating tasks with mathematical opportunities and by orienting the students towards using mathematics to investigate the problems. Each teacher allowed their students to introduce most of the mathematical ideas used to investigate the modeling questions. Each task became a mathematical modeling task by the way it was implemented, through teachers' and students' contributions to the activity.

While wind energy was the primary target of past investigations, water energy follows most of the same dynamic principles. However, water currents tend to be much more stable than their wind current counterparts, and many water currents exist in channels that favor the compact shape of the cross-flow turbine. These advantages have rejuvenated interest in cross-flow turbine design for marine energy generation. Computational models give engineers the ability to accurately estimate what designs work best to avoid costly field maintenance and downtime. Specifically, computational fluid dynamics uses the Navier-Stokes equations, a set of differential equations that describe the pressure and velocity fields in a fluid domain. The Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence model described in this work examines how controlling the pitch of water turbine blades can improve system performance and reliability. Pitch means that the blade noses up or down about the chord line which runs from leading edge to trailing edge relative to the inflow. Pitch control was originally developed for helicopter blades and is commonly used by conventional wind turbines, but pitch control for water turbines is a relatively new research area. Initial results suggest significant incremental gain in power output with pitch control up to 149%, as compared to a no-pitch case, based on a to-scale representation of the cross-flow water turbine in the Fluids and Computations Laboratory at Montana State University. Simultaneous reliability gain is observed as the force transmitted by the water to the blades is reduced by 135%; this may allow for lower cost turbine structures and streamlined hydrofoil design. Additionally, turbine wake profile visualization and blade pressure coefficient curves describe the viscous interaction both quantitatively and qualitatively. Cross-flow water turbines have the potential to become a significant worldwide energy source, with performance optimization studies such as these a necessary prerequisite.

Replacement beef heifer development is critical for the continued production of beef and for ranch success. Objectives of this research were to investigate the growth and reproductive responses of developing heifers fed similar basal diets supplemented with pellets containing different feed additives. Pellet treatments consisted of 2.27 kg x heifer -1 x d -1 of: 1) control with no feed-additive (CON), 2) 200 mg x heifer -1 x d -1 monensin (MON), or 3) 40 g x heifer -1 x d -1 calcium propionate (PRO). Experiment 1 utilized one hundred and ninety-eight heifers (254 + or = 3.8 kg) stratified by BW and randomly assigned to one of six pens (n = 2 pens per treatment). Experiment 2 utilized fifty-eight heifers (304 + or = 3.4 kg) stratified by BW and randomly assigned to one of 12 pens (4 pens per treatment). Heifers were fed a grass hay basal diet in both experiments (Exp. 1: 65% TDN and 11% CP; Exp. 2: 62% TDN and 15% CP, DM basis). Experiment 1 was 129 d and Experiment 2 was 122 d. Body weights were collected at the beginning and end of each experiment, with interim BW collected every 30 d. Serum samples were collected via coccygeal venipuncture and analyzed for progesterone to determine pubertal status. Overall pregnancy rates and pregnancy rate from AI were determined. Experiment 1 observed no differences for initial BW, final BW, overall ADG, pregnancy rate from AI, or overall pregnancy rate (P > or = 0.16). Fewer CON and PRO heifers were pubertal at experiment start than MON heifers (P < or = 0.01) in Experiment 1, which was unexpected. Differences in puberty achievement were diminished at the end of the experiment. Experiment 2 observed no differences for initial BW, final BW, overall ADG, pregnancy rate from AI, or overall pregnancy rate (P > or = 0.19). Treatment had no effect on puberty achievement at beginning or end of experiment (P > or = 0.09). A period effect was observed for ADG in both experiments (P < or = 0.01) which may be related to cold stress. Neither calcium propionate nor monensin resulted in improved performance compared to no feed additive. Further research is warranted to elucidate the impact of calcium propionate on heifer development.

(Diptera: Muscidae) has become a cosmopolitan pest of livestock, companion animals, and humans. Both males and females require daily blood meals and will opportunistically feed on many terrestrial mammals. They have rarely been seen to feed on birds, despite the presence of many potential hosts. A unique feeding behavior was documented at a wildlife refuge in northeast Montana when stable flies were seen congregating on the heads and eyes of West Nile-infected American white pelicans. The objectives of this investigation were to describe adult phenology near the pelican colony and to determine daily and lifetime fecundity when fed on cattle, horse, or chicken blood. From 2008-2010, relative adult abundance was measured by placing white Coroplast Â® cards near the colony, around confinement lots, and along transects in pasture used by grazing cattle. Results showed that temporal dynamics varied by habitat type (2008: F = 7.4; df = 16, 191; P < 0.001; 2009: F = 17.7; df = 14, 270; P < 0.001) and that local dispersal occurred throughout the season. Weekly changes in abundance were explained by temperature, precipitation, and degree-days in 2008 (F = 12.2; r Â² = 0.13) and 2010 (F = 13.8; r Â² = 0.27) and by temperature and precipitation in 2009 (F = 164.6; r Â² = 0.82). Stable flies from a laboratory-maintained colony were provided with cattle, horse, or chicken blood and daily and lifetime fecundity rates were measured through F 2 adult emergence. Flies fed chicken blood laid more eggs per day than those fed cattle (P = 0.008) or horse blood (P = 0.05), but lifetime fecundity was similar between treatments (x Â² = 3.4; df = 2; P = 0.2) because of shorter oviposition periods in cohorts fed chicken blood. These results indicate that the nutritional composition of blood from these hosts does not explain the rarity of stable flies feeding on birds. Implications of host defenses as an explanation for stable fly behavior are discussed.

The study is intended to determine whether statistically significant coefficients of production can be derived from the tax data and whether the results make reasonable economic sense. The motivation for doing the study was an interest in exploring the possibility of income tax data serving as a less expensive and more convenient source of data than has been previously available. Heretofore, most farm production economic studies have relied on data from survey schedules. Obtaining data through specifically designed surveys is expensive and time consuming, and all too often the information is of questionable accuracy. In approaching the income tax data, two production functions were statistically derived; one for grain farms and another for livestock farms. These functions were then compared to those derived from previous studies that used other types of Montana data and similar variables. The similarity of the compared results was used to determine whether reasonable estimates could be derived from the tax data. Statistical criteria were used in evaluating the reliability of the data. The thesis yields the conclusion that income tax returns represent an acceptable data source, and that the production functions derived were reasonably descriptive of Montana grain and livestock farming.

The objectives of this study were: 1) To measure germination, dormancy, and viability of six native forbs, 2) To determine whether increasing forb seeding rate will yield an increase in forb establishment, 3) To examine the effects of a species mixture versus a single species on establishment and survival of desired species, and 4) To determine whether a mixture or a monoculture of forbs is more competitive with spotted knapweed. We hypothesized that high forb densities will occur at the highest seeding rate. We also hypothesized that seeding a species rich mixture of forbs will establish average densities of all the species seeded as monocultures, regardless of water frequency. Monocultures of purple coneflower, arrowleaf balsamroot, annual sunflower, dotted gayfeather, western white yarrow, sticky geranium and a mixture of all forbs were used to test emergence at two seeding densities, two watering frequencies and all were seeded with a background density of spotted knapweed. The highest seeding rate produced the highest plant densities, regardless of water frequency. The mixture yield about average of the individual plant densities and about doubled in response to the highest seeding rate, but was not influenced by watering frequency. Our final hypothesis stated that a mixture of forbs will be more competitive with spotted knapweed than a monoculture of purple coneflower. Spotted knapweed, purple coneflower, and a mixture of associated forbs were used as a model system to test our hypothesis. Multiple linear regressions predicting biomass was calculated using initial and final densities of both species. The forb mixture was 7 times more competitive with spotted knapweed than purple coneflower alone when using initial density. This study suggests using a mixture of forbs, rather than a single species, will enhance the likelihood of establishment in various and unpredictable environments because the group possesses a variety of traits that may match year to year and site to site environments, and once established the mixture may have a greater chance of persisting than a monoculture.

For students to be successful in science, they need to develop a working knowledge of the terminology. This requires the student to make the shift from simply reciting a word's definition or picking the definition from a group of phrases to using the terminology to express ideas and explain reasoning both verbally and in writing. In this study, a group of students collaboratively developed a website that was used as an instructional tool. This ""wiki"" allowed students to build their understanding of the science vocabulary and to develop their understanding of the science concepts as they created an online glossary and discussed content related questions online. The quantitative data did not clearly indicate that a wiki, as it was used in this study, was a consistently effective tool for increasing student understanding of science vocabulary and content.

We used the MRFTrust algorithm created by Tosun and Sheppard to produce an anytime algorithm for trust propagation.

Data were collected over 16 weeks. Students were placed in three different seating arrangements for three weeks each: self-chosen seats, randomly assigned seats, and teacher assigned seats. Each was repeated to make a total of six treatment periods. Students' attitudes and motivation to learn were measured by their attitude survey and interview responses. Multiple choice formative assessments were administered each day to measure each student's level of engagement and understanding of the daily learning objectives. Curriculum unit difficulty levels were calculated to ensure that no one treatment was significantly different than the next. The results showed that teacher chosen seating arrangements yielded better performances across the entire population. When investigating higher- and lower-performing students, the high performers accomplished significantly better results with the aid of teacher chosen seats, whereas the lower-performers showed no improvement with any seating method. The findings also revealed that, within my student interview group, there was significant improvement in all performance levels with the teacher chosen seats. These results indicate that well-developed communication between instructor and student helps to inform the teacher of necessary accommodations for each student. The results revealed that the most effective teaching days occurred during teacher chosen seating treatments where I was more able to control the classroom environment while experiencing the highest level of comfort.

The secondary analysis was conducted with data collected from the Women to Women study at Montana State University-Bozeman, a study which provided computer-based support to women with chronic illness who lived in rural Montana. Asynchronous, computer-based communications of thirteen women were examined. A content analysis of data previously identified as having spiritual content by the research team was undertaken. Analysis of Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ) scores, was also performed. Six categories emerged from the content analysis, which were prayer, faith, verse, finding meaning, transcendence, and family. The women used spirituality to support each other and they shared and relied on their faith to deal with trying times. They prayed for each other, shared bible verses, hymns, and poems all in an effort to deal with illness and daily life. The degree of social support was examined and there was no statistical difference in PRQ scores from the beginning to the end of the computer intervention phase. The communications of the women who had particularly high or low scores were further explored relative to their group interactions. Results of this study were consistent with findings in previous literature that identified a link between spirituality and social support, yet the relationship between the two remains unclear. Nursing implications include clarifying the role of spirituality in chronic illness and the continued research into the relationship between spirituality and social support.

Reconfigurable, SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are especially promising candidates for future spacecraft computing platforms; however, their susceptibility to radiation-induced faults in their configuration memory makes their use a challenge. This thesis presents the design and testing of a redundant fault-tolerant architecture targeted at the Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. The architecture is based on a combination of triple modulo redundancy (TMR), numerous spare units, repair (scrubbing), and environmental awareness. By using the spares and the partial reconfiguration capabilities of the FPGA, the system can remain operational while repair of damaged modules proceeds in the background. The environmental awareness is supplied by a multi-pixel radiation sensor designed to rest above the FPGA chip, providing information about which areas of the chip have received radiation strikes. The system places these potentially damaged areas first in the queue for scrubbing. Four implementations of the architecture with different types of computing module and numbers of spares reveal its versatility and scalability. These four demonstration systems were modeled with theoretical Markov calculations, for the purpose of determining their reliability. They were also implemented on Xilinx hardware and tested by the injection of simulated faults, based on realistic orbital fault rate data from the Cosmic Ray Effects on Micro-Electronics Code (CREME96) tool. These results confirm that the systems will be highly reliable under typical earth orbit conditions. The results also demonstrate that the inclusion of numerous spares and the sensor both lead to substantial improvements in the Mean Time Before Failure, over a traditional TMR system with only three modules and scrubbing.

Geologic storage of CO 2 in deep brine-bearing aquifers is currently viewed as an alternative to its release to the atmosphere. The effects of injecting CO 2 into these aquifers are poorly understood. An experimental apparatus was developed to reproduce subsurface conditions relevant to geologic sequestration to simulate CO 2 injection and assess CO 2-brine-rock interactions. Technology available for this type of experimental apparatus was advanced by enhancing monitoring capabilities to include in situ pH, EC, pressure, and temperature measurement and continuous logging of these variables. This thesis describes the experimental apparatus and its novel capabilities, demonstrates its accuracy and precision, and presents and discusses a suite of CO 2-brine and CO 2-brine-rock interaction studies relevant to geologic sequestration. Experiments were conducted by flowing brine and/or supercritical CO 2 through the apparatus, with and without rock cores in line. Rock samples were limestones/dolostones from the Madison Formation in the western Black Hills, South Dakota, which was selected based on its applicability as a primary large-scale geological CO 2 storage target. Outcrop blocks were machined to produce cores with minimal evidence of weathering to best simulate subsurface Madison Formation rock. Brines were prepared in the laboratory of a similar composition to reported literature values for in situ Madison formation fluids. Results from the experimental system show good agreement with bench pH and EC measurements when utilizing standardized fluids. Experimental data indicate that adding CO 2 to brine under all tested conditions significantly reduces brine pH, an important control on subsurface geochemistry. This effect is partially buffered by flowing the fluids through Madison rock cores, due to dissolution of carbonate minerals, predominantly dolomite. The experiments indicate that samples of the Madison Formation with in situ brines can be partially dissolved via exposure to supercritical CO 2. Similar processes would likely occur in the subsurface Madison Formation in response to addition of supercritical CO 2. The novel experimental system provided new data that could be utilized in refining geochemical models; however, further improvements can be made to the system to improve its capabilities in this regard.

In order to examine the implications of these changes for meat supplies and prices, and to evaluate alternative policies for the future, a quadratic programming model of supply and demand for the sector is developed. This model is used to examine policies, concentrating on meat and feed imports and feed ration distribution. I conclude that only large increases in imports can prevent decreases in per capita meat consumption.

By introducing digital portfolios, and analyzing data from surveys, questionnaires and assessment scores it was suggested that digital portfolios increase student engagement in math and science through self-monitoring, reflection and having a useful container for tasks in math and science. Portfolios also increase student interest in math and science and scores on unit assessments. Lastly, teacher best practices were also influenced positively through the treatment of digital portfolios in a fourth grade classroom.

Constraints may be energetically dissipative due to impacts and friction. In the frictionless setting, we generalize Hamilton's principle of stationary action, central to the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics, to reflect optimality conditions in constrained spaces. We show that this generalization leads to the standard measure-theoretic equations for shocks in the presence of unilateral constraints. Previously, these equations were simply postulated; we derive them from a fundamental variational principle. We also present results in the frictional setting. We survey the extensive literature on the subject, which focusses on existence results and numerical schemes known as time- stepping algorithms. We consider a novel model of friction (which is more dissipative than standard Coulomb friction) for which we can give better well-posedness results than what is currently available for the Coulomb theory. To this end, we study multi-valued maps, differential inclusions, and optimization theory. We construct a differential inclusion we call the feedback problem, for which the multi-valued map is the solution set of a convex program. We give existence and uniqueness results regarding this feedback problem. We cast the persistent contact evolution problem of our novel model of friction into the form of a feedback problem to derive an existence result.

Crop water use is a function of genetic, environment, and management factors. This thesis addresses how these factors interact with crop water use and productivity in Montana. In chapter 2, a two-year (2014-2015) study compared winter wheat yield and protein following fallow and three intensive sequences on deep and shallow soils. Water extraction was measured on deep soils, and kriged soil depth estimates served as a surrogate for stored soil moisture on shallow soils. On deep soils, yields ranged from 72-84% of fallow-wheat from 20.5 mm less water extracted below 45 cm, while protein was ~0.63% greater in intensified sequences. On shallow soils, sequence did not affect yield or protein. Yields increased with soil depth while protein decreased in 2014, but no trends were observed in 2015 due to 47 mm greater precipitation from joint to heading. Intensive sequences diminish wheat productivity on deep soils, whereas soil depth and precipitation timing control productivity on shallow soils. In chapter 3, state-wide cultivar testing, soils, and climate data was used to quantify four general drought patterns in winter wheat and five in pea. Cultivar had little impact on yield compared to drought pattern with winter wheat yields ranging from 4421 kg ha -1 to 2539 kg ha -1 and pea yields ranging from 2877 kg ha -1 to 975 kg ha -1. Yields negatively correlated with drought intensity at heading in wheat (r 2=-0.79) and flowering in pea (r 2=-0.76). Quantifying drought patterns provides a physical interpretation to improve management and breeding efforts. In chapter 4, yield-evapotranspiration (ET) functions were derived for spring wheat, pea, and chickpea from a three-year (2002-2004) seeding date trial. Yield-ET functions were coupled with ten-year (2005-2015) climate records to predict yields at four staggered seeding dates. Yield predictions were converted to marginal revenues based on high, medium, and low markets and fixed production costs. Across seeding dates and markets, simulated returns were highest for chickpea (~601 $ ha -1) followed by wheat (372 $ ha -1) and pea (202 $ ha -1). This indicates chickpea should be seeded before wheat and pea.

Starch is also the principal constituent of cereal seeds and its variation greatly influence crop yields. The starch pathway is complex and its regulation is not fully understood. Transcription Factors (TFs) are known to act as master regulators of whole biosynthetic pathways and the work presented here was aimed at gaining a better understanding of starch production in leaves by identifying a TF which specifically regulates the leaf starch biosynthetic pathway. Leaf starch levels are regulated in part by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the rate limiting step of starch biosynthesis. Transgenic rice event (NR16+) with increased leaf AGPase activity (due to overexpression of the AGPase large and small subunit transgenes Sh2r6hs and Bt2) was subjected to RNA-sequencing. The results indicated that the leaf specific AGP transgene, which increased leaf starch, also had upregulation of the WRKY76 TF. Another regulatory protein, F-Box, was chosen as a candidate due to the F-box family's involvement in plant development. The current study examines the potential of these gene products for increasing starch biosynthesis in leaves via leaf specific overexpression. Results indicate that overexpression of WRKY76 increases leaf starch an average of 39% at both the one month and anthesis growth stages in comparison to the Varietal Control Nipponbare. WRKY76 transgenic lines have enhanced phenotype with an improved harvest index due to biomass and immature panicles trending down by 4% and 21% respectively, while seed weight trended 12% higher. Events overexpressing WRKY76 were also found to upregulate important starch biosynthetic and carbon metabolism genes including AGPL1, AGPS2, SSIIIb, GBSII, Rbcs, PRK, and GS2 as well as leading to a general upregulation of leaf tissue carbohydrates. Events 1, 2, and 12 additionally had on average 13% increased photosynthetic rate at the one month growth stage. The findings of this study support WRKY76 as a dynamic regulator of the starch biosynthetic pathway conferring more efficient carbon assimilation leading to an increased harvest index.

Examining the accuracy of research equipment and methods that elicit similar behaviors as the general public is difficult. This research used driving as a model to address elements in the procedures that participants experience to elicit realistic behaviors. An instrumented vehicle (IV) and driving simulator (SIM) measured experimental behaviors for average approach speed (in the 20m before the legal stop line); lateral distance from curb at 20m; lateral distance from curb at legal stop line (0m) and the stopping location (distance before or after 0m); and, compared with measured general driving public behaviors at stop-controlled intersections. The linear mixed effect analyses combined two experiments. In both, surveys were administered to gather driver's trait anxiety, driving anxiety and social desirability scores. Experiment One drivers (36% female) were grouped as Novice (5, 16-17 year olds who just obtained driving license), Young (4, 16-17 year olds who obtained license over a year ago) and Adult (5, 30-55 year olds licensed near age 16). Experiment Two drivers (47 SIM, 44 IV; 35% female) were College age (18-21 year olds licensed near age 16) and exposed to 1 of 16 different combinations (one of those treatments matched Experiment One's procedure) of procedural changes for: researcher attire (casual or formal), researcher proximity (control room, front or rear passenger seat), mode of instruction delivery (spoken, read or video) and hypothesis statement (none or explicit). At the end of Experiment Two, participants' understanding of the experiment was coded into three debriefing variables. Absolute behavioral validity of the IV to public behavior was achieved in one treatment (formal, front seat, spoken and no hypothesis) and including the debriefing variables in the model; no SIM combination achieved this. Trait anxiety scores appeared to explain behaviors in the IV or SIM and improved result interpretation as interactions with other independent variables. For improved research methods, it is recommended that coded debriefing variables, specific procedural elements, and trait anxiety scores be included and used to explain interactions or differences in participant behaviors.

These limitations can be overcome using drop-based microfluidics. In this discipline, pico-liter sized, water-in-oil emulsions serve as independent 'test tubes,' allowing for the compartmentalization of community constituents and interrogation at the single cell level. Furthermore, two-phase, continuous flow microfluidic devices enable drop populations to be manipulated and analyzed at kilohertz rates according to experimental needs. In this research, a fluorescence-based method for drop analysis and sorting was developed and applied, in conjunction with other microfluidic techniques, to perform assays in microbiology. The applications explored include cell dormancy within P. aeruginosa subpopulations, microalgae lipid accumulation for the production of biofuels, optimization of microbially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP), and human norovirus infectivity. Results from each application include: 1. The hibernation promoting factor (Hpf) was found to play a key role in the maintenance of P. aeruginosa viability during planktonic starvation. 2. Progress was made on a Nile Red based, ultra high-throughput, single cell algal lipid detection platform. 3. MICP was demonstrated at the single cell level. 4. A drop based human norovirus infection platform was attempted using human B cells as the viral host.

Improvements to wheat quality can be made by generating new alleles in quality related genes via ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis. A series of novel puroindoline alleles were selected because each imparted a unique level of grain hardness. The impact of each allele upon wheat milling properties was tested by creating isolines in two wheat varieties. The results demonstrated that specific levels of grain hardness associated with individual puroindoline alleles result in modified break and total flour yield and modified flour particle size. A similar project was undertaken to create modified forms of several glutenin genes, which impact wheat flour mixing properties. The creation of novel glutenin alleles resulted in major loss of gluten function in nonsense mutations, while missense mutations generally did not significantly impact protein quality traits. Generating novel alleles in genes that have limited natural allelic variation is worthwhile, which is reinforced with the unique milling properties created in the puroindoline study. However, the application of EMS mutagenesis may not be equally useful for all genes impacting quality traits, since the generation of novel glutenin alleles did not result in significant improvements to wheat protein quality.

They are not only the most abundant organism on Earth, but also plausibly the most ancient. The ancient origin of phage suggests that they have had the ample opportunity to undergo the evolutionary changes necessary to perform intricate coordinated biological functions. Therefore, characterizing a tailed bacteriophage will help not only to understand biology, but also help us to establish a relationship between structure and function. Viruses display a dynamic equilibrium between structural conformations, stability, flexibility and rigidity which is essential for the perpetuation of life cycle. Understanding this complex biophysical relationship is a daunting task and requires a combination of multidimensional approaches. P22 is a tailed bacteriophage and displays a series of structural transitions during maturation. To understand the important biophysical changes in the P22 at different stages of maturation, we have introduced a suite of orthogonal techniques to address the distinct properties of intermediates. These include Differential Scanning Fluorimetry which probes the thermal stability of P22 capsids, Hydrogen-Deuterium Mass Spectrometry, which probes the conformational flexibility and Atomic Force Microscopy and Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation, which probe the biomechanical transformation in the capsids. P22 investigation using these techniques reveals the large scale structural arrangements along with the expansion. Global rearrangement results in an increase in stability, rigidity and reduced dynamics. The sum results of these studies indicate that expansion is accompanied by large scale inter-subunit rearrangements which lead to the enhanced hydrophobic core at different quasi-equivalent axes. We have also studied Adeno-associated viruses, which is used as a gene delivery vehicle for the treatment of genetic disorders. AAVs lipase contains a lipase domain and its activation is important for the successful infection. Activation mechanism of lipase domain is not thoroughly understood. To understand the mechanism, we have developed a Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry assay sensitive enough to measure lipase products. This assay confirms that prolonged incubation of AAVs with liposome is able to activate the lipase domain without the involvement of receptors and co-receptors.

The most successful training method to date for RBMs is Contrastive Divergence. However, Contrastive Divergence is inefficient when the number of features is very high and the mixing rate of the Gibbs chain is slow. We develop a new training method that partitions a single RBM into multiple overlapping atomic RBMs. Each partition (RBM) is trained on a section of the input vector. Because it is partitioned into smaller RBMs, all available data can be used for training, and individual RBMs can be trained in parallel. Moreover, as the number of dimensions increases, the number of partitions can be increased to reduce runtime computational resource requirements significantly. All other recently developed methods for training RBMs suffer from some serious disadvantage under bounded computational resources; one is forced to either use a subsample of the whole data, run fewer iterations (early stop criterion), or both. Our Partitioned-RBM method provides an innovative scheme to overcome this shortcoming. By analyzing the role of spatial locality in Deep Belief Networks (DBN), we show that spatially local information becomes diffused as the network becomes deeper. We demonstrate that deep learning based on partitioning of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is capable of retaining spatially local information. As a result, in addition to computational improvement, reconstruction and classification accuracy of the model is also improved using our Partitioned-RBM training method.

As such, most do not see the value in taking the class and are unable to make connections between what we learn and occurrences in their everyday lives. This classroom research project focused on the implementation of project-based learning instruction to increase student attitude towards science, increase academic achievement, and reinforce the connection between biology and the real world. Lessons for two treatment units focusing on Mendelian Genetics and Molecular Genetics were taught using the principles behind project-based learning. In each unit, students worked in collaborative groups to solve an overarching problem that tied together all aspects of the unit. At the end of the unit, a project-based learning artifact or final product produced by the group is presented to school, family, and community members. Data was collected in various formats throughout project implementation. Students completed surveys prior to the start and at the end of the project-based learning units. In addition, nine students were interviewed at the mid and end point of the project. Student scores on assessments, such as quizzes and tests, were compared between students in the treatment group taught via project-based learning and students from the 2014-2015 school year who were taught in a more traditional setting. Results showed that while project-based learning did not significantly increase student achievement it also did not negatively impact achievement. This showed that project-based learning instruction was equally effective when compared to the traditional, teacher-centered classroom. Regardless of the lack of achievement gains, students preferred this method of instruction. They found instruction via project-based learning more engaging and thought that it offered a level of flexibility they did not have in previous instructional units. This instructional method works for a large variety of students, in particular, students who prefer hands-on learning experiences.

Pornographers have historically relied on technology to distribute personalized sexual experiences to consumers. Emergent communication technologies have similarly found commercial success through the adult industry in the 20th and 21st centuries. A mutually beneficial sex-tech relationship now endures as the modern adult industry exerts significant influence over the fate of new communication technologies. In this paper, I examine the historical role that pornography has played in the mainstream integration of modern communication technologies. I next apply this analysis to one of the most discussed technologies on the market to date, Virtual Reality (VR), to argue that its mainstream adoption is similarly being influenced by porn. The adult industry's early monetization of 360Â° content, and relevant immersive innovations, are early indications that VR porn may be the next high-tech symbiosis.	['science', 'technology']

If students become more effective readers of science text will their attitudes and values towards reading change? In this study reading strategies were implemented with the purpose of helping students read more effectively. Students were instructed in the use of six different strategies. As students used the strategies, their reading skills, values and attitudes were measured using standardized tests, surveys and formative assessments. The results indicated that students improved their reading skills and would complete reading assignments. It was also found that when students are aware of effective reading strategies, they would be likely to use them independently in the future.

American Indians have a high incidence of both prediabetes and diabetes as a group compared to other ethnic groups in the U.S. There is a lack of data in the literature about what American Indians from the Crow Tribe in Montana consider to be cultural information that they feel should be included in education for pre-diabetics. This qualitative ethno-nursing study was conducted through one-on-one interviews with six American Indian women of the Crow Tribe over a period of months to determine what they defined as culturally important for the health care provider to know when teaching about prediabetes. The data from these interviews were then analyzed using qualitative software by Ethnograph Â®, and four primary themes were found. These themes were: extended family and elders, spirituality and traditions, culturally specific foods and activities and a feeling of inevitability of developing diabetes. As cultural competency is an area that is included in all schools of nursing and some schools of medicine, it is important that health care providers have an awareness of cultural specific health information. All the informants in this study reported that they felt more respected when their health care provider brought up the topic of how their culture affects their health habits, as well as how important to them it is that the health care provider be open to learning about the specifics of their culture.

These analyses are usually performed by modeling a simplified version of the real structure to obtain the global deformations of the surface of the mirror. This method eliminates the ability to represent localized deformations and strain gradients, resulting from thermal and mechanical loading, which may exceed the mechanical limit of the materials or material interfaces in coated mirrors causing delamination or cracking. The goal of this study is first to improve optical performance modeling by incorporating localized strain behavior within material layers and at material interfaces, bond strengths between mirror coatings and substrates, gravitational deformations, and effects of size scaling on deformation and strain magnitudes. Second, these methods will be used to investigate viability for constructing a coated mirror with mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) with an interlayer of a polymer with a designable CTE to improve thermal deformation and reduce the risk of structural failure. Modeling localized regions of an optic requires incorporating length scales differing by nine orders of magnitude. In order to precisely predict localized effects of the loading conditions, combinations of shell and continuum elements were used to minimize model size and computational time while localized accuracy is retained. Tie constraints were used to connect different elements and meshes and zero-thickness cohesive zones were created to predict delamination at material interfaces. Material properties for each material were specified to appropriate regions within the model, enabling realistic representation of deformation within mirror layers. This process was demonstrated on 3-D and axisymmetric models of a three-component mirror comprised of a coating, substrate, and an intermediate polymer layer with a designable CTE. Deformation and strain results were shown to change as the intermediate layer CTE was varied. Inclusion of the polymer layer was shown to have a slight effect on deformation resulting from gravity loading. Cohesive zone modeling techniques were used to investigate the strength of material interfaces after qualitative experimental verification. Parametric studies performed using axisymmetric cohesive zone models show that delamination resistance can be improved by tuning the polymer CTE.

The study addressed concerns about increasing numbers of students enrolling in remedial mathematics courses because they did not develop sufficient understanding in previous courses. The Framework-oriented instruction was designed to help students develop deep and well-connected knowledge of procedures, which has been shown to facilitate recall and promote future learning. Data collection spanned the Fall 2005 semester at a western land-grant university. In the quasi-experimental design, instructors from six intact sections of college algebra were matched into pairs based on prior teaching experience, and the treatment condition was assigned to one member of each pair. Equivalence of treatment and control groups was established by comparing ACT / SAT scores for the 85% of students for whom those scores were available. Data collection consisted of classroom observations, homework samples, common hour exams scores, procedural understanding assessments, supplemental course evaluations, and a final interview with treatment instructors. Analysis of covariance was the primary statistical tool used to compare treatment and control group performances while controlling for attendance rates and pre-requisite mathematical knowledge. Treatment group students scored significantly higher than control group students on the procedural understanding assessments. Moreover, although treatment students were assigned 18% fewer drill questions than controls and 8% fewer problems overall, the gains in procedural understanding were realized without declines in procedural skill. The relationship between understanding and skill was also examined, and students with greater procedural understanding tended to score higher on the skills-oriented final exam regardless of which treatment condition was assigned to them. Finally, the interview with the treatment instructors provided insight into the implementation issues surrounding the treatment. They expressed concerns about time constraints and reported initial discomfort with, but eventual appreciation for, using the Framework for Procedural Understanding to guide instruction. The Framework-oriented treatment was found to be effective at helping students develop deeper procedural understanding without declines in procedural skill. Additional implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed.

Students were involved in seven different writing activities aimed at learning and remembering science content. Students also wrote reflections after inquiry activities to help them connect the activity to the content learned in the classroom. During Chapter 1: Introduction to Living Things, students did not receive write-to-learn activities. Chapters 2: Viruses, Bacteria, Protists, and Fungi and Chapter 3: Introduction to Animals, students did receive write-to-learn activities. From the Introduction to Living Things chapter to the Introduction to Animals chapter, there was a 14% increase in test score medians. Students' confidence in their writing and memory skills improved.

This capstone project was designed to develop high school biology lessons that incorporate data literacy skills into the curriculum. It was hypothesized that student engagement, confidence and skill levels would improve if authentic data was used in these lessons. Lessons were designed that incorporated each data literacy skill into a different unit of instruction. Success of the project was assessed with two skills tests, student surveys and interviews. It was shown that students' data literacy skills and confidence levels increased substantially with these lessons. In addition, student engagement and interest levels improved with the use of real data.	['life sciences', 'high school students', 'biology', 'students', 'science', 'persons']

In this research project, the use of menus as a differentiation method was studied with two classes at a small, rural school. The first class studied was a 7th-8th grade life science class of 11 students, the second was a 9th-grade physical science class of seven students. Each class was taught four separate units. In two of the units, students were given a list-style menu of activities from which they selected a certain number of their choice to demonstrate their mastery of the unit objectives. The other two were taught using a more traditional mixture of mini-lectures, labs, and written activities in which the entire class received the same assignment. Student mastery of unit objectives, student attitudes towards science in general and their class in particular, and the effects of this teaching method on the classroom teacher were investigated using a range of data collection methods including pre- and post-unit assessments, student written surveys, student oral interviews, and a teacher journal. Although no significant overall trends in student content mastery were observed during this research, the performances of some individual students in both classes were affected negatively by this technique, while others showed a slight improvement in mastery during the treatment units. The majority of students liked having the ability to choose activities and be responsible for their own learning. The researcher intends to use a modified form of the menu-style units in the future, perhaps with a more limited scope and shorter time frame.

One of the major power components for photovoltaics is the DC-DC converter required to increase the voltage produced. A hybrid DC-DC boost-forward topology was explored. A switch on the secondary side can be turned off and the converter will take the characteristics of a boost converter. These predictions were confirmed by simulating this cirucit in MatLab Simulink, and finally by building a prototype circuit. A desired output of 170V - 100W was produced and the efficiency was measured. The boost-forward converter peaked at about 85% efficient which was below the 94% efficient boost converter. The boost-forward converter, however, was found to have a higher efficiency than the boost converter when the input voltage was below 34V . The circuit is designed to work as a boost converter when the input voltage is above 34V . When the input drops below that voltage the converter can be put into the boost-forward converter configuration by closing the switch on the secondary side.

Natural history filmmaking has increasingly used techniques of fiction, drama and anthropomorphizing to represent the natural world in storytelling. This paper will examine the use of the nonverbal form of filmmaking as an alternative style that can be used to effectively document natural history using a more lyrical, poetic and often more thoughtful style. This work examines previous works in the non-verbal genre and discusses how this style compares with historically more traditional natural history films and why this alternative style is used for the thesis film. Additionally, works from the disciplines of geography and natural history writing are examined for relevance to the non-verbal natural history filmmaking genre.

Consequences of these changes often involve major alteration to the original function of the landscape, particularly concerning wetland and riparian areas. In southwest Montana, large developments have recently been created or expanded in the subalpine environment. Wetlands in these regions bear a particularly unique structure, and often are influenced by the effects of development. The alteration to structure can result in disturbance to the original hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical functions of wetlands. Restoration efforts attempt to mitigate for development influences, but the monitoring and success criteria do not wholly address the functional attributes of these features. At the same time, little is known about the structure of undisturbed subalpine wetlands and how environmental drivers influence the undisturbed structure and hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical functions. Knowledge of these natural processes is necessary to ensure appropriate management decisions and future restoration success. This study examines small subalpine wetlands in an elevation range of 2256-2316 m located in southwest Montana. Study sites include two wetland types, in undisturbed and restored conditions. This research examines physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological attributes of wetlands in varying conditions, to define and compare wetland characteristics, determine primary environmental drivers of wetland ecological and biogeochemical functions, and compare response to human perturbation. Comparisons of our data indicate significant differences in all categories of parameters, and include metrics of biodiversity, primary productivity, hydrologic regime, and physical and chemical properties of the soil. Several environmental drivers are identified, with the primary driver of vegetation and redox response variables being depth to water and persistence of saturated conditions. The depressional wetland type is characterized by a distinct hydrologic regime, with these conditions being significantly related to a greater number of ecological and biogeochemical functions than the linear wetland type. Restoration data indicate that the restoration methods employed are sufficient in establishing the primary wetland characteristics used in wetland definition. However, the trajectory of restored wetlands indicates that long term recovery may result in wetlands exhibiting different structural and functional attributes than intended.

Spotted knapweed creates large monocultures, which decreases biodiversity, reduces livestock and wildlife forage, and increases surface water runoff and soil erosion. Sheep are an effective tool for controlling spotted knapweed and have been widely used on cattle ranches for weed control. However, cattle producers are concerned that sheep will over-utilize desirable graminoids. Therefore, research is needed to determine an effective grazing strategy using cattle and sheep that will adversely affect spotted knapweed, while minimizing over-use of desirable graminoids across the landscape. This 2-year study quantified graminoid and spotted knapweed utilization and diet composition and foraging behavior of cattle and sheep sequentially grazing spotted knapweed-infested rangeland in western Montana. Twenty-one Targhee yearling wethers and 9 Black Angus yearling cattle were used. Animals were randomly assigned to one of 3, 0.81-ha pastures that were grazed in either mid-June or mid-July (n=6 pastures). Cattle grazed each pasture for 7 days, immediately followed by sheep grazing for 7 days in each month. Analysis of covariance was used to determine differences in diets, relative preference indices, foraging behavior, and utilization between June and July for cattle and sheep to determine the optimal month for implementing prescribed sheep grazing. Relative utilization of spotted knapweed did not differ between June and July and averaged 61.5%. Graminoid utilization was moderate (<45%). Cattle preferred forbs in June, spotted knapweed and forbs in July, and avoided graminoids in July. Sheep avoided graminoids in June and July, preferred forbs in June, and showed no preference or avoidance of spotted knapweed. Cattle ranches with large spotted knapweed infestations can effectively use prescribed sheep grazing immediately following cattle grazing in June or July to achieve high levels of use on spotted knapweed, thus reducing viable seeds incorporated into the soil, while maintaining optimal utilization levels on desirable graminoids.

Several procedural restrictions were placed on the commercial fisheries of the region at that time in an effort to reduce the potential for human induced mortality on sea lions. Several years have elapsed since these restrictions were put into place and questions about their efficacy abound. In an effort to determine whether or not fisheries interventions have helped the SSL population to recover, estimates of the fishing activity of the Bering Sea/ Gulf of Alaska commercial fisheries in the vicinity of individual Steller sea lion rookeries and SSL population trends at those rookeries were made using data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Fisheries Observer Program and Steller Sea Lion Adult Count Database. Fisheries data from 1976 - 2000 were analyzed in relation to SSL population counts from 1956 - 2001, at 32 rookeries from the endangered Western Stock. Linear regression on the principal components of the fisheries data show that a positive correlation exists between several metrics of historical fishing activity and SSL population decline. The relationship is less consistent after 1991, supporting a hypothesis that fishing closures around some of the rookeries have been effective in moderating the localized effects of fishing activity on SSL.

All of these needs are highly energy dependent, and, to a significant degree, rely on an inefficient use of fossil fuels. In order to break free of this dependence, new understanding is required for how to efficiently generate the products humanity needs. Here, a model system of two closely related [FeFe]-hydrogenases, CpI and CpII, is employed in order to understand how biology is able to efficiently control the formation of reduced products, in order to further delineate the limits of control, and the extent to which biology may be co-opted for technological needs. CpI, one of nature's best catalysts for reducing protons to hydrogen gas, is compared to CpII, which functions catalytically to oxidize hydrogen to protons and electrons. Oxygen sensitivity, midpoint potentials, catalytic mechanisms, and catalytic bias are explored in-depth using electron paramagnetic resonance, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, and protein film voltammetry. CpI and CpII have been found to function under different metabolic conditions, and key amino acids influencing their distinct behavior have been identified. The conduit arrays of hydrogenases, which direct electrons to or from the active site, have been found to have distinct midpoint potentials in CpII compared to CpI, effectively reversing the favored electron flow through CpII in comparison to CpI. In order to probe the contributions of the protein framework on catalysis, analysis of site-specific amino acid substituted variants have been used to identify several determinants that affect the H-cluster environment, which contributes to the observed differences between CpI and CpII. This has resulted in a deeper understanding of the hydrogenase model system and the ability to directly influence catalytic bias. Thus, the work presented here represents key progress towards developing unidirectional catalysts, and demonstrates the possibility of targeted, rational design and implementation of unidirectional catalysts.

Propagated vegetatively, a sustainable potato industry relies on pathogen free, tissue culture-produced plantlets to maintain low disease incidence in seed potato stock. Potato virus Y (PVY) infection is the most significant threat to seed potato production. Therefore, determining the influence of cultivar and seed type on PVY incidence could lead to improved management practices. Data from seed potato certification inspection in Montana indicated that plants grown from seed produced in sterile conditions (plantlets and minitubers) had a greater incidence of PVY than plants grown from field-produced tubers. We hypothesized that differences in cultivar, seed type and growth conditions (i.e., sterile vs. field grown) impacted PVY incidence. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant immune response that is induced by pathogens and resistance-inducing agents. Resistance-inducing agents are effectively used to limit fungal pathogens, and we hypothesized that they may also limit PVY infection. To test these factors, potato plants (cultivars Russet Burbank and Norkotah Colorado 3) were grown from multiple seed types (i.e., plantlet, minituber, and Generation 3 tuber (G3)) and mechanically inoculated with PVY strain Wilga in the presence and absence of Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) inducing agents. Percent infection (incidence) was measured with double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DASELISA) at three time points post-inoculation. These studies resulted in the following conclusions: (1) incidence of PVY infection varies by cultivar, specifically, the Russet Burbank cultivar had a lower incidence of PVY than the Norkotah Colorado 3 cultivar, (2) Russet Burbank plants grown from tissue culture plantlets had a higher incidence of PVY infection than Russet Burbank plants grown from field-produced G3) tubers, and (3) phosphorous acid (PhostrolÂ®), an inducer of Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) may reduce PVY infection, particularly in Russet Burbank plantlets. These findings advance our understanding of the differences in PVY incidence by cultivar and seed type, and in turn provide valuable information for maintaining pathogen free potato seed.

Lipids are a major component of cells and tissues, take part in a rich network of metabolic reactions, and are implicated in many disease mechanisms. Lipidomics complements genomics, proteomics and the more common metabolomic analysis of hydrophilic metabolites and can provide new insights into disease mechanisms. The problem approached in this thesis was to compare different methods of sample preparation for lipidomics and apply lipidomics to the study of two major health problems: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Excessive dietary intake of sucrose and fructose, common in the Western Diet, increases deposition of triacylglycerides in the liver and leads to cognitive decline in experimental animals. NAFLD increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity and AD. The high diversity and hydrophobicity of lipids complicates their separation, detection and analysis. However, modern chromatography and mass spectrometry instrumentation and techniques are greatly improving the capability of lipidomic analysis. A lipid extraction protocol was optimized for reproducibility and yield, and was used to extract lipids from rat liver under sucrose stress in a model of human NAFLD and human brain cortex from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared to controls. The samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry. The NALFD study did not yield the expected results, instead these data provided a foundation for designing future experiments in progress and to validate the methods used in the AD study. The AD studies showed that several phosphatidylcholine species are down regulated along with acetyl-CoA, which may be the source of low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in AD. Two different chromatography methods were used to seek a higher coverage of different lipids. Differences in the lipids in AD and controls were evident in the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. The precursors of long omega-3s synthesis were increased while the products EPA and DHA were decreased. In a similar fashion, precursors to long omega-6s were found to be decreased, while the products were increased. This suggests that the omega-6 synthesis pathway may be outcompeting the omega-3 synthesis.

However, while their scripts may call for activism, their expository, realistic style, with hidden production methods, an authoritative tone, and pristine visuals, instead encourages voyeurism. In addition, standard theater and television distribution methods offer no outlet for action to viewers who do feel inspired. I offer a different model for influence in my wildlife series Nature Break: reflexive filmmaking. In this series I use such reflexive strategies to critique the voyeuristic way in which spectators consume wildlife and nature films. However, critiquing passive spectators with reflexivity is not the same as creating active spectators. Therefore, with Nature Break I go beyond simply making and distributing a film. Additionally, I will create a related website on the Internet as a platform for viewers to post their own films, discuss issues inspired by films on the site, and coordinate activism efforts. Through Internet distribution, the Nature Break series can finally live up to the reflexive filmmaker's goal of creating an art that leads to activism.

Our objective was to determine how forage biomass was affected by different sheep grazing patterns to answer the following questions: 1) will forage consumed by sheep while grazing leafy spurge be mitigated by higher forage biomass production resulting from lowering leafy spurge biomass production, 2) what timing and intensity of grazing maximizes forage biomass production and minimizes leafy spurge biomass production, 3) will defoliating leafy spurge result in higher forage biomass production by the end of the first grazing season, and 4) does the density of leafy spurge affect the response of forage biomass production. Three leafy spurge-infested sites in southeastern Montana were mechanically defoliated each summer for two or three years in a manner which mimicked sheep grazing. Plots were defoliated once or twice per growing season at pre-flowering, flowering, seed production, or pre-flowering and seed producing phenological stages of leafy spurge. Grasses, forbs, and leafy spurge were defoliated at two different intensities in irrigated and non-irrigated plots. High intensity defoliation of only forage species at flowering tended to result in lower forage biomass and higher leafy spurge biomass. On average, three years of high intensity defoliation of forage species at pre-flowering resulted in forage biomass sufficient to replace forage removed by sheep; three years of low intensity defoliation of forage species at pre-flowering and seed production resulted in forage biomass higher than baseline at all sites, but forage biomass production was not sufficient to replace all forage removed by sheep. These same treatments lowered the amount of leafy spurge biomass produced. High intensity defoliation of forage species and leafy spurge at pre-flowering, and at pre-flowering and seed production resulted in higher forage biomass at the end of the first grazing season at only one site. Leafy spurge density did not affect treatments. Therefore, sheep grazing at the proper timing and intensity can lower leafy spurge biomass and result in higher forage biomass production. However, care must be taken to avoid overgrazing desirable species after pre-flowering.

A person's mindset towards our natural resources can be influenced if you introduce alterations to their lifestyle. As visitors observe more efficient and less costly methods, they are more likely to implement them into their own lives. The human race has taken for granted that we must pump oil and gas from the ground; that power plants pollute; that our cars pollute; and that our skied are clouded with smog. Is this simply the price we must pay for the convenience that our current technology offers? With changes in the way we design buildings, we can move towards buildings that generate more pollution-free power than they use. The balanced marriage between high-technology to generate pollution-free electricity and low-technology to stabilize indoor temperatures is a way to bridge both worlds together while still focusing on detail and design. The Eco-Lodge Vision for Sustainability: Be responsible stewards of the environments and communities in which we live, work, and play. Strive to improve environmental performance in all of our operations. Be a leader in sustainability in our professional organizations and the broader tourism sector. Educate staff, guests, and suppliers about our sustainability goals and initiatives, and encourage personal action. Operate in a manner that is compliant with all government laws and regulations.

TBP also has an N-terminal region that, in vertebrates, is highly conserved. We have generated mice bearing a mutant tbp allele, tbp deltaN, that lacks 111 of the 135 amino acids of the vertebrate-specific N terminus. Most homozygous mutants, tbp deltaN/deltaN, die at midgestation from an apparent defect in their placentas. tbp deltaN/deltaN fetuses were rescued at this midgestational crisis if supplied with a wild-type tetraploid placenta. tbp deltaN/deltaN fetuses also survived in immune-normal mothers when fetal/placental beta 2m expression was genetically disrupted. When reared in immunocompromised mothers, tbp deltaN/deltaN fetuses also survived midgestation. These results suggest the N terminus of TBP functions in beta 2M-dependent processes and within the placenta to favor immunotolerance during pregnancy at midgestion. Beyond midgestation, tbp deltaN/deltaN fetuses that survive in immunocompromised mothers were found to be runted at the perinatal period and died shortly after birth. These latter results suggest that the N terminus of TBP also functions in non-immune processes required for normal birth weight and successful pregnancy.

This claim is backed by observations of increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from nearly 280-ppm around 1750 to 360 ppm in 1995 [4]. By the end of 2010, this number was up to approximately 390 ppm [5]. To reduce human influence on the global environment, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is proposed as a means of collecting CO 2 generated through industrial and consumer processes and sequestering it so as not to release it into the atmosphere, thereby reducing atmospheric concentrations of the gas. Suggested methods of sequestration include direct deep-sea injection [6], soil sequestration through improved land use and management practices [7], and geological carbon sequestration in which captured carbon is injected into underground geological features. This research focuses primarily on development and testing of a leak detection technology for deployment to geological sequestration sites. A diverse technology portfolio will be required to implement safe and efficient sequestration solutions [8]. Included in this portfolio is technology capable of monitoring sequestration site integrity; detecting and signaling leakage, should it occur. Early leak detection is paramount to ensuring on-site safety and to minimize, or at least understand, potentially harmful environmental leak effects.

Grain texture in wheat directly affects many end use qualities such as milling yield, break flour yield, and starch damage. The Hardness (Ha) locus located on the short arm of chromosome 5D is known to control grain hardness in wheat. This locus contains the puroindoline a (pina) and puroindoline b (pinb) genes. All wheats to date that have mutations in pina or pinb are hard textured, while wheats possessing both the 'soft type' pina-D1a and pinb-D1a sequences are soft. Furthermore, it has been shown that complementation of the pinb-D1b mutation in hard spring wheat can restore a soft phenotype. Here, the first objective was to identify and characterize the effect the puroindolines have on grain texture independently and together. The second objective was to determine which milling bread baking characteristics are affected by the seed specific over-expression of puroindolines. To accomplish both of these objectives a hard red spring wheat, possessing the pinb-D1b mutation, was transformed with 'soft type' pina and pinb, creating transgenic isolines that have added pina, pinb, or pina and pinb. Northern blot analysis of developing control and transgenic lines indicated that grain hardness differences were correlated with the timing of the expression of the native and transgenically added puroindolines. The addition of PINA decreased grain hardness less than the reduction seen with added PINB. Friabilin abundance was correlated with the presence of both 'soft type' PINA and PINB and did not correlate well with total puroindoline abundance. Selected T3 lines were grown in a field trial with two replications under dry and irrigated field conditions. Harvested grain was then milled and baked. Lines transformed with the puroindolines exhibited decreased total flour yields and increased break flour yields, yielding flour with lower protein and ash content. Decreases in loaf volume, mixograph absorption, and crumb grain scores were also observed in transgenic lines. These results demonstrate that the puroindolines can be used to profoundly influence grain hardness and a variety of milling and bread baking traits in wheat.

The 5E learning cycle model consists of five phases of teaching: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate. The phases are not linear and can be taught in a dynamic approach to address demonstrated student comprehension of the content. During this investigation, students completed an interest survey every six weeks and completed pre- and post-tests throughout the treatment period. The treatment consisted of an Illinois State Achievement Test (ISAT) preparation unit and three mini-units: atoms, force and motion introduction, and speed and motion graphing. There were slight gains noted in student self-expressed interest and confidence in science throughout the treatment period and school year, and student self-expressed interest and confidence fluctuated. Interest in a science career demonstrated the greatest gain. Students also demonstrated small gains within the mini-units. However, greater gains were achieved and noted within the ISAT preparation unit, especially when compared to a traditionally taught classroom. Within this research project, it was determined that the 5E model has the potential to improve student academics, interest and confidence in science, when implemented properly and with dedication and fidelity.

ETEC is able to adhere to the small intestine by utilizing pili or fimbriae, one of which is the fimbriae Colonization Factor Antigen/I (CFA/I). The extracellular portion of CFA/I fimbriae is comprised of two fimbrial subunits, cfaB and cfaE. Expression of CFA/I fimbriae on the surface of an attenuated Salmonella vaccine vector, Salmonella-CFA/I, results in a biphasic T cell response in immunized mice. This response is characterized by the initial production of Th2-type cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-5, followed by a shift after 4 weeks toward an IFN-gamma-associated, Th1 response. Restimulation of CD4 + T cells from Salmonella-CFA/Iimmunized mice with CFA/I fimbriae also generates the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Salmonella-CFA/I is able to generate antigen-independent Foxp3 + regulatory T cells, which are able to reduce symptoms of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in immunized SJL mice and Collagen Induced Arthritis in DBA/I and C57BL/6 mice, via production of IL-10 and TGF-beta by phenotypically distinct regulatory T cell subsets. The following research describes the contribution of cfaB and cfaE to the observed therapeutic and immunological responses. This was measured by independently expressing recombinant cfaB and cfaE proteins and evaluating the associated cytokine responses from the co-culture of these proteins with CD4 + T cells from immunized mice. Major Histocompatibility Complex II-restricted immunodominant regions were also mapped for both cfab and cfae proteins using cytokine ELISAs, ELISPOTs, Proliferation Assays, and flow cytometry. We mapped an IFN-gamma-producing peptide from cfaB and an IL-4-producing peptide from cfaE. We further determined that co-culture with peptides from both fimbrial proteins is able to generate regulatory T cell-associated cytokines including IL-10 and TGF-beta as well as the newly described suppressive cytokine, IL-35. These results show that the immune responses to cfaB and cfaE are mediated by multiple immunodominant regions within each protein.

The data-to-concept model is a pedagogical approach where students gather data first and formulate their own explanations or mental models for the observations prior to any introduction to the concept or vocabulary associated with the concept. While a previous study supports achievement gains in science after implementing a data-to-concept curriculum, there is uncertainty about the distribution of achievement gains in science across various subpopulations such as gender, Title I status and income status. Comparisons were made using students' scores from MontCas (Montana's state achievement test), Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, a modified Science Attitudes, Skill and Knowledge survey along with interviews of both teachers and students. Analysis indicates that in general, students make gains in their reasoning skills after two years of data-to-concept science classes. There does not appear to be a difference in science achievement based on gender or income status, but there seems to be an achievement gap based on Title I status. In relationship to attitude, students generally have a positive attitude towards science after one semester of data-to-concept instruction. Both teachers and students prefer the data-to-concept method to more traditional, expository methods of teaching and learning. In general, this study supports the use/implementation of a data-to-concept curriculum. While in general this is true, there are some improvements to the data-to-concept model, which will be necessary to make achievement equitable for all students regardless of status. The science department at Big Sky High School will have to address the achievement gap based on Title I status. In my classroom, I will need to work to help students understand the limitations and power of science as a way of understanding the natural world. The data-to-concept model of instruction is supported by data and preferred by both students and teachers.

This issue for Native American students at Tribal Community Colleges has an enormous effect on future opportunities in education, employment, politics and society. The overarching research question was: How does the implementation of small peer-led collaborative learning groups affect students in developmental mathematics courses at the Tribal Community College? To answer this question five sub-questions were addressed. What impact will the treatment have on: 1) completion, 2) perseverance, 3) demonstrated procedures of mathematics, 3) personal skills for success, and 4) the leaders' perceptions of the benefits associated with acting as small peer led collaborative group leader? This research study took place at a small Tribal Community College. The quasi-experimental, mixed methods study involved collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The treatment class consisted of having the students work together on a workshop activity designed to be engaging, challenging and relevant for one class period each week in small peer-led collaborative learning groups. Peer leaders were chosen according to predetermined criteria. The peer leaders were trained to help guide the group in the direction of a solution and to help the group learn how to collaborate to achieve the best results. The control class was given the same workshop activity to work on, but not encouraged to work together nor assisted by a peer leader. Results of this research study show increased completion and perseverance rates. Students participating in the small peer-led collaborative groups were more likely to attempt mathematics. The attitude toward mathematics was the most drastic change; students now look forward to attending their mathematics class and spend more time out of class doing mathematics. Group leaders gained personal, academic and leadership skills. Detailed descriptions of the results are given. In conclusion, implications of the findings and how they may be used are provided for mathematics instructors, administrators and student support personnel are offered. Recommendations for further research are also suggested.	['education', 'postsecondary education', 'civilization', 'education, higher', 'auxiliary sciences of history']

Significant feed price increases in recent years threaten sustainability of the industry. In the US tilapia are often subjected to extended hauling to reach live-fish markets. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to optimize dietary protein and lipid levels for juvenile tilapia cultured in high-intensity recirculating-water system and assess how dietary changes alter hauling stress-tolerance. To achieve these objectives, a 3 X 3 factorial design was used with practical-type diets formulated to contain three levels of dietary protein (28, 32 and 36%) and three levels of dietary lipid (3, 6, and 9%). Juvenile tilapia (34.5 Â± 0 .4g initial weight) were fed one of the nine diets, three feedings/d to apparent satiation, six d/wk for 12wk. Fish were weighed and counted every three weeks and feed consumed recorded weekly. At the conclusion of the feeding trial, three fish per tank were sampled for proximate composition analyses. One week post-conclusion of the feeding trial, tilapia remaining in each tank were subjected to a simulated live haul in which fish were transferred to insulated container (2lbs/gallon) with supplemental oxygen for 24h, and then returned to their source tank and allowed to recover for an additional 48h. Hematocrit, glucose, lactate and cortisol measurements were collected at time 0, 24h, and 72h. Increasing dietary protein significantly improved tilapia weight gain (P=0.01), feed conversion (FCR, P=0.03), feed intake (P=0.02), protein retention (P=0.01) and filet ratio (P=0.01). Increasing dietary lipid also significantly improved weight gain (P=0.05) and FCR (P=0.01) but at 9% decreased feed intake (P=0.02). Blood chemistry values were also altered by dietary protein and lipid levels (Figure 1). No significant interactions between dietary protein and lipid levels on growth performance or blood chemistry values were measured. Results of this study suggest that while increasing protein and lipid levels in tilapia diet formulations improved production of tilapia cultured in high intensity systems and that, stress tolerance during live hauls appeared to be reduced.

MRM has the ability to probe an opaque system non-invasively and collect velocity measurements, imaging data, diffusion, and relaxation values and is an asset in the quest to learn how biofilms establish, grow, and die. The goal of these studies was to extend current biofilm research using MRM to enhance our understanding of transport phenomena over a hierarchy of scales, from the microscopic diffusion level to the macroscopic bulk flow. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the bacteria chosen for the biopolymer diffusion and the secondary flow studies due to its common identification in opportunistic biofilm infections. This diffusion study was the first Pulse Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) MRM measurements of the impact of environmental and chemical challenges on the biomacromolecular dynamics in medically relevant S. epidermidis biofilm material demonstrating the ability to characterize molecular dynamics in biofilms, providing a basis for sensors which can indicate the state of the biofilm after thermal or chemical treatment and provide information to further understand the molecular level mechanisms of such treatments. The secondary flow data clearly support the conclusion that reactor size impacts studies of spatially distributed biological activity, and the idea that, scaling of transport models in biofilm impacted devices is possible but requires more study. Additionally, due to the increasing amount of CO 2 in the earth's atmosphere and the need to understand the options of sequestering this CO 2 to combat the impacts of global warming, studies were conducted to understand how biofilms grow in porous media. The resilience of Bacillus mojavensis biofilms to super critical CO 2 is documented, and thus, this bacteria was chosen. Results indicate that by varying exchange times, T 2-T 2 experiments can determine the extent of biofilm growth in an opaque porous media as demonstrated in multiple glass bead pack configurations. Using MRM as a tool to study these biofilm systems over a wide range of environmental conditions is the focus of the research presented in this dissertation.

The developed system, named GDClust (Graph-Based Document Clustering) [1], works with frequent senses rather than dealing with frequent keywords used in traditional text mining techniques. GDClust presents text documents as hierarchical document-graphs and uses an Apriori paradigm to find the frequent subgraphs, which reflect frequent senses. Discovered frequent subgraphs are then utilized to generate accurate sense-based document clusters. We propose a novel multilevel Gaussian minimum support strategy for candidate subgraph generation. Additionally, we introduce another novel mechanism called Subgraph-Extension mining that reduces the number of candidates and overhead imposed by the traditional Apriori-based candidate generation mechanism. GDClust utilizes an English language thesaurus (WordNet [2]) to construct document-graphs and exploits graph-based data mining techniques for sense discovery and clustering. It is an automated system and requires minimal human interaction for the clustering purpose.

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) provide the advantages of high energy conversion efficiency, low emissions, fuel flexibility and both portable and stationary application. High material cost and need for longer material lifespan still impede the wider use of SOFCs. To produce substantial voltage, planar SOFCs are joined into stacks using interconnects. Interconnects both separate and connect each individual fuel, separating gas flow and conducting current. For SOFCs that operate at less than 800Â°C, metal alloys are being considered for the interconnect, particularly ferritic stainless steel. Ceramic coatings are being explored to improve the surface conductivity over time and significantly reduce Cr volatility from the steel. In addition, the coating must have a matching coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and be compatible with electrode and seal materials. One promising coating is (Co,Mn) 3O 4 spinel, which is deposited using various techniques, resulting in different thicknesses, compositions and microstructures. In this study, stainless steel 441HP samples were subjected to three levels of preoxidation prior to coating with 2 micron CoMn alloy using magnetron sputtering. Samples were subsequently annealed to Co 1.5Mn 1.5O 4 in 800Â°C air. Oxidation behaviors were evaluated as a function of exposure to laboratory air and dual atmospheres (3% H 2O and H 2 on one side, 3% H 2O and air on the other) and area specific resistance (ASR) measurements in lab air, all at 800Â°C. In addition, chemical and phase composition, mass gain, and adhesion were investigated using a complimentary suite of analytical techniques. Preoxidation was found to inhibit Fe transport from the stainless steel into the coating and exhibited a substantially thinner surface oxide layer after oxidation. Preoxidized samples also maintained slightly lower ASR values after 1650 hours in 800Â°C air compared to non-preoxidized samples. Oxidation behaviors, their possible mechanisms, and implications for SOFC interconnects will be presented and discussed.	['oxidation']

Iterations, which are required for the interdependent tasks, make traditional PERT/CPM not applicable for the estimation of the project completion time. In addition, carrying out a large scaled project in a dynamic environment has to deal with various factors throughout the entire project life cycle. When estimating the project completion time, previous research often focused on one subject of interests and assumed the other factors causing little effects on the overall project duration. The objective of this thesis is to develop a simulation research framework to help estimate the project completion time and analyze the major factors that affect the estimation for complex concurrent engineering projects. The framework consists of three major components: 1) Data Collection, where the needed data for simulation are prepared including project task structure, task relations, and quantified team member characteristics; 2) Simulation, where tasks are dynamically assigned to the appropriate members/engineers according to each member's knowledge level to the task, teamwork capability, work schedule availability, and learning curve improvement; and 3) Data Analysis, where significant factors to the project completion time are studied by the ANOVA analysis based on the simulation results. According to the findings from the ANOVA, heuristic rules are developed to improve the performance of task-member assignments. The effectiveness of the research framework, the simulation model and the heuristics is demonstrated by an illustrative example.	['project management', 'management']

Numerous biotechnology professional development programs exist for science teachers to gain knowledge and skills that are necessary to teach biotechnology. While it is an easy transition to teach biotechnology methods in advanced and AP level courses, there is uncertainty about the limitations and accommodations that will be necessary to incorporate biotechnology labs into a regular high school biology classroom with 28 students or more of various levels and exceptionalities. The additional expense and time necessary to incorporate biotechnology are justified if students gain increased conceptual understanding and demonstrate improved attitude toward science as a result of the labs. The primary question I sought to answer with this project was what are the effects of incorporating biotechnology labs on high school students' understanding of molecular biology concepts? Secondary questions related to the project are: What were the effects of incorporating biotechnology labs on students' interest in science, students' confidence in their abilities to do science, and on my teaching practices? The sequence of biotechnology labs that occurred within the curriculum of compulsory high school biology were quantitative protein analysis of food, DNA fingerprinting, pGLO bacterial transformation, and GMO investigation of food. The labs utilized Vernier Probeware and Bio-Rad Explorer kits. Conceptual understanding of molecular biology concepts was assessed using student developed concept maps and free-response questions. Anonymous student surveys and one-on-one student interviews were used to assess attitude toward science, which is defined in this project as interest, confidence, and relevance. Results for improved attitude were inconclusive; however gains in conceptual understanding were substantial with the biotechnology labs.

This resistance is due in part to a biofilm forming bacteria's ability to sense and communicate with neighboring bacteria. As a result of this intercellular communication, bacteria are able to cooperate as a complex community. This communication system is used to modulate important facets of biofilm behavior and thus is an attractive target for biofilm control and potential antimicrobial agents. Inhibition of the molecular signaling system used by biofilm forming bacteria could lead to an effective treatment of chronic bacterial infections by interrupting the communication that promotes biofilm formation. Specifically, this will be accomplished be preparing synthetic analogues of signaling molecules possessing the N-acyl homoserine lactone structural motif. This structural component is well conserved among the signaling molecules in biofilm forming bacteria and it is hoped that these analogues will inhibit biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synthetic analogues of the N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone structural motif have been prepared that inhibit the signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These synthetic inhibitors have also been shown, using a novel application of the colony biofilm assay, to increase the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to treatment with the antibiotic tobramycin. Additional inspiration has been taken from the structure of bacterial communication molecules that has lead to the design and synthesis of a novel class of biocides. These bifunctional molecules incorporate a biocidal property into the N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone structure. This bifunctionality could potentially enhance the specificity or potency of a biocide over the currently available treatments.

Participants studied categorized and unrelated word lists and were asked to recall the items under one of the following test conditions: standard free recall, free recall with a penalty for guessing, free recall with no penalty for guessing, or forced recall. The results showed that both older and younger adults adjusted their responses in accordance with test instructions. Older adults reported a greater number of intrusions relative to younger adults in both standard and penalty instructions, particularly those intrusions that were plausible given a prior study list. Additionally, older adults were more likely to report intrusions with greater confidence that they were presented on an earlier studied list. Results demonstrate that older adults report memory information on free recall tasks with a liberal response bias, as evidenced by a decreased ability to withhold reporting intrusions and claiming to remember intrusions with greater confidence compared to younger adults.

Emissions of CO 2 are rising as the global demand for inexpensive energy is placated through the consumption and combustion of fossil fuels. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) may provide a method to prevent CO 2 from being exhausted to the atmosphere. The carbon may be captured after fossil fuel combustion in a power plant and then stored in a long term facility such as a deep geologic feature. The ability to verify the integrity of carbon storage at a location is key to the success of all CCS projects. A laser-based instrument has been built and tested at Montana State University (MSU) to measure CO 2 concentrations above a carbon storage location. The CO 2 Detection by Differential Absorption (CODDA) Instrument uses a temperature-tunable distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode that is capable of accessing a spectral region, 2.0027 to 2.0042 microns, that contains three CO 2 absorption lines and a water vapor absorption line. This instrument laser is aimed over an open-air, two-way path of about 100 m, allowing measurements of CO 2 concentrations to be made directly above a carbon dioxide release test site. The performance of the instrument for carbon sequestration site monitoring is studied using a newly developed CO 2 controlled release facility. The field and CO 2 releases are managed by the Zero Emissions Research Technology (ZERT) group at MSU. Two test injections were carried out through vertical wells simulating seepage up well paths. Three test injections were done as CO 2 escaped up through a slotted horizontal pipe simulating seepage up through geologic fault zones. The results from these 5 separate controlled release experiments over the course of three summers show that the CODDA Instrument is clearly capable of verifying the integrity of full-scale CO 2 storage operations.

The calculated lifetime range of 2 ps - 4 ns is in agreement with experiment. The fluctuations in the electron transfer rate are shown to be dictated by the fluctuations in the density of states. This is evident by the comparison of the fractional deviation of the interaction, density of states and the rate. Here the fluctuations in the density of states is an order of magnitude larger than the fluctuations in the interactions and is nearly the same as that of the kET fluctuations. This demonstrates that the fluorescence lifetime variability is controlled by the electrostatic environment and not the distance dependence of the interaction.

Phosphorus, typically a nutrient limiting contaminant is responsible for eutrophication and algae blooms in lakes and streams and the wastewater from agricultural, industrial and domestic sources is under continued scrutiny from the regulatory environment. Constructed wetlands mimic natural wetlands and are used worldwide for the removal of nutrients in wastewater streams but the research and applications for removal of phosphorus has lagged behind other nutrients and contaminants. This paper is an extensive literature review of construct wetlands and the ongoing applications for phosphorus removal. This review includes recent research on the mechanisms of removal, an evaluation of different plant species, a discussion of phosphorus partitioning in the wetland environment and a look at the use of chemical additives to improve the removal efficiency. Hybrid constructed wetland systems that closely mimic the biological nutrient removal systems for large scale WWTP facilities are being built around the world to improve effluent water quality and take advantage of the benefits of each type of constructed wetland. Maximizing the removal of phosphorus in wastewater will require a multi-pronged approach that includes biological, chemical and physical removal of the phosphorus in both the design phase and ongoing operation of the constructed wetlands system. Several trends in constructed wetlands phosphorus removal are emerging: the primary removal mechanism for phosphorus removal is accretion and new soil sediments, and the use of chemical additives for precipitate and final removal of phosphorus is required for the removal efficiencies required by regulation. The varied applications and results of constructed wetland systems with respect to phosphorus removal are discussed throughout the paper. Floating island technology, using a buoyant material that supports plants, is a newer unique application of constructed wetlands that can be used to remediate wastewater and remove contaminants. Based on the literature search, a series of experiments to further characterize floating islands and improve the removal of phosphorus from wastewater are recommended using this technology.

Recent advances in digital technology make it easier to incorporate the fragmented frame into visual narrative strategies. I argue that properties inherent to the split-screen technique (including simultaneity, symmetry, visual irony, omniscient view and visual style) also emerge as attributes of a split-screen aesthetic. The split-screen aesthetic transforms a technical contrivance that has long provided an alternative to parallel editing, into a powerful narrative tool that facilitates the construction of visual stories in a spatial context. I trace the history of the use of split-screen by describing its function in selected visual works, including a medieval triptych painting, a 20th Century art installation, two films and a contemporary television program. A close analysis of a dual-screen video art installation helps characterize elements of the cinematic split-screen aesthetic. I also provide an account of the application of a split-screen design in my own experimental short video. As multi-screen formats continue to evolve, they invoke the split-screen aesthetic to shape the stories emerging from new spaces.

Fifteen elite/college level cross-country ski racers (8 men, 7 women) tested UBP on a custom-built double-poling ergometer. Ski poles tested were two models of the same brand with different factory-specified stiffness ratings. Subjects underwent three 10 s UBP tests (W10, W) and one 60 s UBP test (W60, W) for each pole type. UBP measures were defined as the average power output over the length of each test. Video recordings of the 10 s and 60 s tests were analyzed with digital imaging software to determine the maximum bend angle for each pole type. Ergometer and kinematic measures were compared by ski poles tested (stiff vs. less stiff) using a multivariate RMANOVA.	['research']

The results of this study imply that if educators can tie their curriculum to science concepts, students will achieve higher in science.	['persons', 'students']

To address this challenge, I pursued the following questions as part of this dissertation: How do spatiotemporal distributions of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) hydrologic connectivity influence whole catchment hydrologic dynamics and what are the implications of this for stream biogeochemistry? What are the implications of catchment structure for riparian buffering and streamflow source water composition? What are the hierarchical controls on hydrologic connectivity and catchment runoff dynamics across 11 diverse headwater catchments and across flow states? I addressed these questions through detailed hydrometric monitoring and analysis (160 recording wells across 24 HRS transects and stream discharge across 11 catchments), tracer sampling and analysis (groundwater, soil water, and stream water sampling of major ions, specific conductance and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), and newly developed digital landscape and terrain analyses. I installed this unprecedented network of instrumentation to address these questions across 11 adjacent and nested catchments within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF), Rocky Mountains, MT. I determined that 1) hillslope topography, specifically upslope accumulated area (UAA), was the first order control on the duration of transient water table connectivity observed across HRS landscape positions; 2) the intersection of HRS connectivity with riparian area extents determined the degree of riparian groundwater turnover, riparian buffering of upslope water, and the magnitude of DOC transport to streams; 3) 11 catchments' stream network hydrologic connectivity duration curves were highly correlated to streamflow duration curves and the variable slopes of these relationships were explained by vegetation, geology, and within catchment distributions flowpath length and gradient ratios. This dissertation consists of five key chapters / manuscripts that address how landscape structure/organization within and across catchments can control the timing and magnitude of water and solutes observed at catchment outlets.

The chapters cover 1) boarding schools aims and student resistance, 2) problems still faced by Native American students, and 3) possible solutions to these problems. Chapters 1 and 2 give an overview of history and research done by educators and scholars. Chapter 3 is a combination of suggestions by educators of Native students and John Dewey. The first sections demonstrate problems and voids in academia, and the final section attempts to show practical and realistic methods for correcting institutional mistakes and/or ignorance which result in high attrition rates. Dewey's pedagogy succinctly breaks down and challenges academic ideology, while at the same time challenging educators with progressive methods. The thesis challenges not only the error of conventional education, but also how education gets defined and placed upon Native students. Also recognized in this thesis, are those areas where an academic self-examination demonstrates difficult, or problematic, areas and situations, where the black and white, or binaries, of education, are not easily noticed, nor navigated by the student or the teacher. In general, the aim of the discussion is to further democratic methods in Native American education by literally bringing those students into consideration, and to look at what we do in academia in light of the past, present, and future, within an unbroken link of time and pedagogy.

Much of the historical scholarship on the period has focused on the scientific debate over the health effects of low-level radiation exposure or on determining what and when the Atomic Energy Commission knew about the health effects fallout. This dissertation, however, argues that the growth of ecological thinking about the health effects of fallout exposure in environmental sciences such as ecology, oceanography, and meteorology dramatically reshaped what was known about radiological risk and provided the scientific foundation for the Limited Test Ban Treaty. By highlighting the ways that radiation traveled beyond the boundaries of the test sites and became incorporated into critical human food chains, this ecological way of perceiving fallout largely replaced previous approaches to fallout risks derived from the discipline of health physics that focused on external forms of radiation exposure and ideas of spatial containment. This dissertation, however, also argues that fallout radiation proved much more than a menacing pollutant. Because environmental scientists can utilize radiation as a tool to trace out structure and function of the ecosystem, as well as oceanic and atmospheric motions, it also emerged during this period as a critical scientific practice. In tracing radiation as it moved through the environment, environmental scientists not only made legible the connections between the health of human bodies and the irradiated environment, but also demonstrated empirically that the earth was a spatially integrated biosphere. Such realizations, this dissertation concludes, formed an important footing the nascent environmental movement and helped establish the authority of the environmental sciences in matters of environmental pollution and regulation.

We show that the decision problems of both MLUC and MLUCP are NP-hard, and that the related optimization problems for maximizing the label sizes are NP-hard to approximate within factor 1.0349. We design approximation algorithms with constant performance guarantees for the two problems: for MLUC, we present a (3 + o)-approximation and a (2.98 + o)-approximation; for MLUCP, a (1.5+o)-approximation and a (1.491+o)-approximation. We also describe the implementation of AMLUC, a software system for automated map labeling with uniform circles. The system is based on our approximation algorithms for MLUC and uses an effective shake-and-grow heuristic to find near-optimal label placements.

Because of constantly changing learning modalities, state standardization of learning and incredibly diverse educational demographic, designing learning spaces that support various pedagogies is paramount if our students are to succeed in the knowledge-based economy. From its beginnings as the rural one-room school house to the contemporary single volume, teaching and learning methodologies are continually changing and adapting to contemporary necessity. Little emphasis has been placed over the qualitative aspects of facilities planning, and how children may benefit from varying spatial environments. No practical and consistent concept of open-space learning has ever been established when considering open-concept education. This is the fundamental tenet to this master's thesis. This thesis will analyze contemporary learning methodologies with particular emphasis on physical learning and the transition to digital learning. Through the analysis of varying pedagogies specific qualitative themes, modalities, and hierarchical mechanisms will be made known and the architectural design strategies will draw upon these themes. The thesis presents information necessary to designing within a neighborhood sensitive to history and place. The rich significance of place in the Mississippi/Yazoo Delta will be a driving force in the design of a K-6 Elementary school to replace the existing school. The thesis will additionally draw upon the analysis of various precedents, demographic studies, site analyses, and code analyses to establish an architecture rich in character and performative qualities necessary for growing minds.

The loss of two and a half billion dollars as well as the complete liquidation of thousands of shareholders created this Warhol moment for the firm's last president and Montana Power. Other dire consequences followed for the state: loss of Montana's only Fortune 500 firm, a doubling of utility bills and the loss of hundreds of jobs for the already depressed Butte area. Montana Power's importance transcends this slapstick ""fifteen minutes"" of fame moment at its demise. Montana Power became one of the few utilities to break from state price regulation during the deregulation mania of the 1990's. In a jarring development, the firm dissipated all its assets and dissolved shortly thereafter amidst a great deal of controversy. However, besides the failure of the firm after the heated deregulation battle, three other areas of the history of this utility proved pivotal in political, economic and environmental terms for not only the state, but also the rest of the West and the United States, as the events surrounding the Butte firm were often regional or national in scope and importance. First, the creation of the predecessors of the firm occurred at the very dawn of the electrical revolution at the turn of the nineteenth century. Powerful men and institutions from the Eastern United States set up the firm in a colonial-style environment and guided the development of the state. With the electricity revolution, dams, power lines, reservoirs, mills and logging operations appeared throughout the landscape. Second, the Great Depression produced an epic battle between public power advocates and trustbusters versus the Butte firm. The New Deal commenced building the Ft. Peck Dam and power stations, while working diligently to break up the utility trusts that included Montana Power. Third, lengthy car lines at gas pumps in the 1970's signaled the onset of the first energy crisis. The power company's attempt to generate energy using steam from coal mined in Eastern Montana set off a literal war with newly emergent environmental movement."

As a result of being uncooled, microbolometer imagers are notably lighter and cheaper than typical cooled imagers, making them ideal for remote sensing. Two novel uses are discussed in the work presented here. The first is the imaging of beehives in order to remotely determine the hive vitality. Bees thermally regulate their hives to a narrow range of temperatures that creates a thermal signature seen in thermal infrared images. For each of the hives imaged, frame counts (or the number of full frames of bees in each hive) were found by manual inspection. Linear regressions of the normalized frame counts of the hives were performed versus the measured hive thermal radiance values. The resulting plots showed a strong relationship between the normalized frame count and the mean radiance of each hive, particularly in images taken just prior to dawn. The second novel use was imaging vegetation exposed to large ground concentrations of CO â over a four-week period in summer for use in leak detection. A CO â leak was simulated in a test field run by the Zero Emissions Research and Technology Center. Thermal infrared images were acquired along with visible and near-infrared reflectance images of the exposed vegetation and healthy control vegetation. Thermal radiance statistics were measured and a regression was performed versus the day of the experiment. The infrared data were found to have a strong R Â² value and clearly show the effect of the CO â on the vegetation. An additional regression was run on the infrared data combined with the reflectance data, and this was found to not add any unique information to the vegetation reflectance data. Both methods were found to independently indicate the potential of a CO â leak before it was detected visually.

To assess the prevalence of root lesion nematodes in Montana, soil samples were collected statewide in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, P. neglectus was found in 12 of the 17 counties and in 41% of all field samples surveyed. In 2007, P. neglectus was found in 11 of 15 counties and in 37% of all field samples surveyed. No P. thornei was found. For fields having root lesion nematode in 2006, P. neglectus mean population densities were 1213 nematodes/kg soil with population densities exceeding the damage threshold of 2500 nematodes/kg soil in 14% of the sampled fields. For fields having root lesion nematodes in 2007, P. neglectus mean population densities were 1303 nematodes/kg dry soil with densities exceeding the damage threshold of 2500 nematodes/kg dry soil in 13% of the samples. Damaging populations were restricted to the north central part of the state and were generally found in fields following a crop of winter wheat (p= 0.02). Stunt nematodes (Tylenchorynchus spp.) were detected in 93% and 85% of sampled fields for 2006 and 2007, respectively. New sources of tolerance and resistance to root lesion nematode are highly sought after due to limited breeding materials. Resistances of 16 cultivars were evaluated through inoculated greenhouse trials where multiplication of the pathogen was observed after 12 weeks of growth. No significant differences in multiplication factors (Rf= population final/population initial) were observed for the first trial (F test, p=0.11) though significant differences were evident between cultivars in the second trial (F test, p<0.001). From the greenhouse trials, the historic cultivar, Ceres was identified as a potentially useful source of nematode resistance. Tolerance evaluations were conducted at two nematode-infested sites (Ulm and Bozeman, MT) where the yield responses of 20 cultivars, with and without nematicide (Temik 15G tm) treatment, were compared. On average, nematicide treatments reduced yields at both sites (Ulm = 0.4% and Bozeman = 7.3%). No significant differences in nematode tolerances was detected among cultivars (Ulm, p=0.08; Bozeman, p=0.14).

Participants included one class of four high school students in an advanced chemistry course. The treatment included three in-context units including the topics of Gasoline, Biofuels, and Plastics. Student learning was assessed using Pre and Post-Knowledge Probes, Focused Listing, and Daily Diagnostic Learning Logs. Student attitude changes were assessed using surveys, interviews, and observations during small group discussions. Results indicated that student learning was positively impacted as all Post-test outcomes had an average increase of over 45%. Student interviews showed that attitudes were positively impacted as all students said they liked chemistry, and after the treatment, found enjoyment in knowing how the world works.

Here, we seek to identify biologically meaningful physiological thresholds of bull trout in the FRB by modeling stream temperature and using the model as a tool to predict thermal changes caused by a warming climate. Specifically, we developed a spatially explicit stream temperature model to quantify and explore the potential range of thermal warming effects, using the case study of bull trout populations in the FRB. Our objectives were to: i) compare spatial and non-spatial statistical models used to predict stream temperatures throughout the FRB; ii) apply a spatially explicit model to estimate thermal thresholds for spawning and rearing and foraging migrating and overwintering bull trout habitats; iii) predict thermal changes under a range of future climate scenarios; and iv) investigate model behavior and inform future research decisions. Development of spatially explicit models, such as the one described here, will create an ideal opportunity to build collaborative relationships through research so that scientists can further understand how climate change will impact freshwater aquatic ecosystems. In particular, model results may be used to perform ecosystem assessments; inform future research needs; and develop conservation plans with broad applications that reach beyond the Flathead system.

In this study, the cercal sensory system of a common house cricket is analyzed. The sensory system consists of two antennae like appendages called cerci that are situated at the rear of the cricket's abdomen. Each cercus is covered with 500-750 flow sensitive hairs that are embedded in a complex viscoelastic socket that acts as a spring and dashpot system and guides the movement of the hair. When a hair deflects due to the drag force induced on its length by a moving air-current, the spiking activity of the neuron that innervates the hair changes and the combined spiking activity of all hairs is extracted by the cercal sensory system. The hair has been experimentally studied by researchers though its characteristics are not fully understood. The socket structure has not been analyzed experimentally or theoretically from a mechanical standpoint, and the characterization that exists is mathematical in nature and only provides a very rudimentary approximation of the socket's spring nature. This study aims to understand and physically characterize the socket's behavior and interaction with the filiform hair by presenting and proving new hypotheses about the hair and socket behavior. The operating principles of the socket can be used for the design of highly responsive MEMS devices such as fluid flow sensors or micromanipulators. A three dimensional computer aided design (CAD) model was first created using confocal microscopy images of the hair and socket structure of the cricket, and then finite element analyses based on the physical conditions the insect experiences were simulated. The results show that the socket acts like a spring but due to its constitutive non-standard geometric shapes, it deforms like a thin membrane at times or like a plate in bending at other instances. It was also determined that the socket provides far greater resistance to hair movement than what has been previously postulated and computed by researchers.

The discovery that the human vascular adhesion protein (HVAP-1) is a copper amine oxidase has sparked considerable interest in the mechanism and inhibition of these enzymes. With the potential for therapeutic applications, substantial efforts have been made to determine the molecular factors which govern inhibitor sensitivity and selectivity for copper amine oxidases. In order to contribute to this growing body of knowledge, a series of inhibitors were screened for their ability to inhibit enzymatic catalysis in the phenylethylamine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO). This CuAO was chosen as a model enzyme for these studies due to its ease in expression and purification as a C-terminal Strep-tag II fusion protein. This work describes the kinetic and structural characterization of a new class of highly potent, reversible CuAO inhibitors with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range. In addition, an investigation of the molecular details of copper amine oxidase catalysis is described; in particular, mechanistic studies of the controversial oxidative half reaction. Studies using the monodentate copper ligand cyanide provided the first spectroscopic evidence for cyanohydrin derivitization of the quinone cofactor in AGAO and led to the proposal of a detailed mechanism for inhibition of CuAO catalysis by cyanide. Lastly, the role of copper during the oxidative half-reaction of amine oxidation in AGAO and Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase (PPLO) was investigated using the exogenously added copper ligand azide. This work describes the first examination of the effects of azide on both the oxidative and reductive half-reactions of multiple CuAOs. Azide is the first example of a CuAO inhibitor that significantly reduces the catalytic rate for one halfreaction thereby abolishing the kinetic independence of the other half-reaction. Taken collectively, these results show that in the case of some CuAOs it is experimentally impossible to discern the effects of azide on copper mediated enzymatic reoxidation from the inhibition induced during the reductive half-reaction.

L) polyphenol oxidases (PPOs)	Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from several plant species, including wheat, have been implicated in the undesirable brown discoloration of food products. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) represents an interesting system to advance our understanding of plant PPO function for two important reasons, namely (1) the large size an complexity of its (allohexaploid) genome, and (2) its economic importance. Prior to this study, the molecular and biochemical properties of wheat PPOs were largely unknown. To remedy this situation, we have performed several BLAST searches of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases, using a known wheat PPO sequence as a search tool. This study suggested the presence of at least six PPO genes in hexaploid wheat, falling into two different phylogenetic clusters of three genes each. Presence of a wheat PPO multigene family was confirmed by Southern blotting. A combination of biochemical (enzyme purification and mass spectrometric analysis) and molecular (Northern) approaches confirmed that members of one cluster are not expressed in the developing kernels and senescing flag leaves, while regulation of one or several members of the other gene cluster controls PPO activity in these tissues. Our data, including immunoblotting and enzyme activity studies, further indicated that wheat PPOs are synthesized as inactive precursor (early kernel development) which are proteolytically processed and activated as the kernels mature. Activation of PPO precursor proteins was also demonstrated in vitro, in presence of purified trypsin. In these experiments, PPO activity increased during the first four hours and remained stable thereafter, indicating that the protein domains responsible for catalytic activity are quite stable. Research performed as a part of this dissertation has also demonstrated that wheat PPO activity is influenced by strong anionic detergents such as SDS and N-lauroylsarcosine. The corresponding experiments indicated that these detergents influenced both enzyme extraction and activity, at least in high-PPO wheat varieties. This work also has practical aspects, making PPO assays (as used by breeders for germplasm screening) more robust. In conclusion, as a result of this dissertation, wheat PPOs have emerged as a fascinating example of a plant multigene family with complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.

69364	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1595	Vaccine platform for infection or autoimmune diseases using an ETEC fimbrial scaffold	The expression of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) fimbriae (colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) or K99) on the surface of a Salmonella vaccine vector confers protection against ETEC challenge. Application of such fimbriae as a treatment for the proinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), or as a molecular scaffold for heterologous antigen expression by cloning enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) LPS peptide mimetics into the K99 fimbriae to produce a dual vaccine for ETEC/EHEC was investigated. The expression of CFA/I fimbriae by a Salmonella vaccine vector stimulates a biphasic T helper (Th) cell response and suppresses proinflammatory responses suggesting that CFA/I fimbriae may be protective against proinflammatory diseases. To test this hypothesis, SJL/J mice were vaccinated with Salmonella-CFA/I vaccine 1 or 4 wks prior to induction of EAE induced with encephalitogenic proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide, PLPâââ-âââ. Mice receiving Salmonella-CFA/I vaccine recovered completely from the mild acute clinical disease and showed only mild inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal cord. This protective effect was accompanied by a loss of encephalitogenic IFN-gamma secreting Th1 cells and replaced with increases in IL-4-, IL-10-, and IL-13- producing Th2 cells. These data suggest that Salmonella-CFA/I is an anti-inflammatory vaccine capable of suppressing proinflammatory cells to protect against EAE via immune deviation. To obtain an effective nasal vaccine for ETEC, the fanC gene of ETEC K99 major structural gene was cloned onto the reovirus adhesin, protein sigma1, which has been shown as an M cell targeting molecule. Although FanC/protein sigma1 fusion protein was successfully expressed, this vaccine failed to elicit immune responses against native FanC protein, presumably because of improper protein folding. Using K99 fimbriae as a molecular scaffold, a LPS peptide mimetic for EHEC was cloned into the fanH gene of K99 fimbriae minor structural gene to enable multiple antigenic peptide expression, resulting in an ETEC/EHEC dual vaccine. Insertion of peptide mimetic into fanH gene had no adverse effect on the formation of polymerized K99 fimbriae. However, various oral immunization regimens failed to induce the protective secretory IgA responses against the LPS mimetic peptide, although serum IgG antibodies were induced.

This miniature instrument will combine reflected light and fluorescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy for potential exobiology or terrestrial environmental use. With the help of a penetrometer, the probe might be used to assess the presence of life on Mars and gain an understanding of Martian soil. Furthermore, this thesis will delineate how this penetrometer may be used to detect underground constituents and pollutants present on our own planet. The proposed FIRP will be incorporated into a penetrometer that will go several meters below the surface seeking bio-signatures and information about soil composition. Microscopic imaging with reflected light will provide morphological context, fluorescence imaging can provide biomass detection, and Raman spectrometry can provide chemical identification of imaged material. The fluorescence technique will mainly depend on the performance of a non-cooled low-noise monochrome imaging camera, optical filters, and high efficiency light emitting diodes in the UV and visible. This miniature instrument will be connected by optical fiber to a surface platform that will host the Raman spectrometer and Raman laser excitation source. This thesis will show the experimental results of a bench-top proof of concept system. Images and spectra were collected and analyzed. Important choices and characteristics of the optical design are discussed relative to Raman and fluorescence detection. Finally, the thesis will propose a prototype of a compact device that combines both sensing methods and is compatible with a penetrometer platform.

Strong growth of that population's storied spawning run between the early 1960s and 1978, when the run peaked at about 70,000 fish, had been considered key evidence of recovery of the lake's YCT population from formerly excessive angler harvest and other adverse factors. Thus the run's subsequent, almost continuous decline to about 500 fish in 2007 was perplexing. Gillnet catches of YCT at established lake locations likewise indicated a concurrent decline in the lake-wide YCT population. Prominent among the factors that may have importantly affected the YCT population during the recent decades was predation by the illegally introduced, reproducing, nonnative lake trout discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Data mainly taken from YCT in the spawning run (n = 29 years) and gillnet catch (n = 30 years) were examined for information useful to specifying the Leslie matrix of a dynamic, age-structured model that had climate as a covariate. The model, fitted to spawning run size and mean total length (TL) of YCT in the run during 1977-2007 (n = 29 data years), explained 87% of variation in observed run size, 86% of variation in observed mean TL, and strongly suggested that climate (as indexed by total-annual air degree-days > 0Â°C measured on the lake's north shore) had an important effect on recruitment of age-0 YCT to subsequent spawning runs. Results also suggested that an effect of lake trout predation on survival of age-1 to age-5 YCT became apparent only during the recent decade. The important test of ongoing efforts to control lake trout in Yellowstone Lake and thereby limit their predation on YCT - on the basis of data for YCT - will occur when climatic conditions improve for YCT recruitment to the Clear Creek and other YCT spawning stocks of the lake.

The combined system incorporates a Laser Desorption (and Ablation) Mass Spectroscopy (LDMS) system into a Time-of- Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) instrument under a single virtual control platform. This is accomplished via customized instrumentation control as well as data acquisition and analysis routines all implemented on the LabVIEW programming environment. The system is named Laser-Assisted Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (LASIMS). The system has the flexibility of carrying out surface characterization and chemical imaging experiments utilizing both the ToF-SIMS and LDMS techniques, generating complementary information from the same area of the sample at (nearly) the same time. A subclass of LDMS is the powerful Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) spectroscopy technique, which now is used routinely in this system. The combined system offers many other practical uses and applications such as laser cleaning of thin metallic films coating an insulating sample to carry out rapid ToFSIMS analysis of such samples, as well as laser-induced enhancement of secondary ion detection of radionuclides, such as 137Cs and U, and the study of isotopic Oxygen exchange on reactive oxide mineral surfaces, which are all detailed in the thesis. We have also tested the fundamental question of whether or not laser and particle beam excitations couple during the desorption and ionization process. The test basically utilizes a short (few ns) laser pulse to bring the surface of the sample to just under laser desorption/ionization threshold by means of local heating and/or photochemical processes, while a focused Ga+ beam that is well synchronized (temporally and spatially) with the laser pulse is used to further energize the sample surface (LASIM excitation) to yield additional molecular fragments from that surface. We observed no additional fragments as a result of LASIM excitation, suggesting no coupling between particle and laser desorption/ionization mechanisms.

Research has shown that M. avium cells in biofilms are more resistant to disinfectants than their planktonic counterparts. Although M. avium has been detected in biofilms in in situ and laboratory models, information available on M. avium is limited compared to biofilm model species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The main objective of the present research was to study the growth of M. avium in biofilms in the presence of P. aeruginosa. Biofilms were grown in sterile tap water on stainless steel coupons in batch mode. Two kinds of reactors were used; mason jars and a recirculation system. Each experiment lasted from 27 to 35 days depending upon the nature of the experiment. The two strains were inoculated in isolation (monospecies) and also in combination (dual species). When inoculated simultaneously, in jar reactor experiments, M. avium density was found lower in dual species than in monospecies biofilms and the difference was statistically significant. However the growth of P. aeruginosa in monospecies did not differ significantly from the dual species biofilms. P. aeruginosa reduced the growth of M. avium. In sequential inoculation experiments an established biofilm of P. aeruginosa did not prevent biofilm formation by M. avium. The growth of M. avium and P. aeruginosa was similar whether they were inoculated as base or invading species. The density of P. aeruginosa remained higher than the density of M. avium in the dual species biofilm, likely due to the higher growth rate of P. aeruginosa compared to that of M. avium. It is important to understand their growth in mixed species biofilms, in order to begin to develop effective methods to both monitor and eventually control this opportunistic pathogen.

69371	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1611	Perspective in wildlife films	Discussions of perspective rarely occur in analyses of wildlife films perhaps because of the near neglect of the genre itself as well as the fact that most analysis focuses on content, rather than structure and style. Perspective has long been a part of narrative film criticism, however, and it is essential to a complete examination of a film genre. I define perspective here as the cognitive view of the mind that commands the subject. In documentary and wildlife films, credibility is vital and the film's perspective or point of view establishes this through the use of the camera apparatus and narration. The very use of these tools of perspective may add to a scientific perspective, but inevitably prevent an objectively scientific representation, the pivot of a fact-driven, wildlife film. Although credibility is established by evidence and facts, a tendency toward anthropomorphism can jeopardize claims of objectivity and scientific credibility.

Cattle can physiologically and behaviorally respond to the changing environment to lower metabolic requirements and reduce the effects of cold exposure. Requirements of grazing cattle may be overpredicted with models developed in controlled settings that do not account for energy conserving behaviors. We refined a simple thermal balance equation to model heat exchange of free-ranging cattle. We accounted for the complex interactions between animal behavior and the changing natural environment by applying the insulation characteristics of cattle's tissue and coat to, first, a simple geometric shape of an asymmetric ellipsoid, and second, to a three-dimensional computer model of a cow at different orientations to the sun and wind. A group of mature cows grazing native range were observed from dawn to dusk from 28 November 2003 to 21 January 2004. These observations were used to evaluate our model and as reference for analyzing cattle behavior in response to environmental variables. Correlation (r) between predicted and measured surface temperatures was 0.82, indicating the model successfully quantifies heat exchanges of cattle exposed to cold conditions in the field. We compared our model predictions with heat production measured in three studies, and with predictions based on the National Research Council beef cattle model. In all cases our model predictions were similar to those reported. Model simulations indicate behavior such as lying and orientation to the sun helped mitigate the effects of extreme weather, and that for many combinations of winter weather variables there is only a small increase in metabolic requirements due to cold exposure in mature beef cattle in a maintenance state. Our results indicate solar radiation contributes strongly to a cow's thermal balance. Thus, previous estimates that did not account for the irradiative environment may have overestimated metabolic requirements of acclimated cattle grazing winter range.

In the literature review preceding this sequential, mixed methods study, three exemplary, research based physics programs for practicing teachers are examined with respect to physics education research, especially the five principles for effective physics teaching set forth by senior physicist and physics education researcher E. F. Redish. This study provides an in depth examination of a well-established physics graduate program for practicing teachers at a small, midwestern university that is also measured against these same five principles: Constructivist, Context, Conceptual Change, Individuality, and Social Learning. In this setting, information was gathered in the form of a teacher survey, as well as through case studies of selected participants. The results of this study affirm that graduate programs designed specifically for the development of physics teachers are, in fact, different. The data also indicates the value placed on, as well as the frequency with which the participants utilize these teaching approaches in their classrooms. Results showed that participants felt the program placed a higher emphasis on using multiple representations to convey information to students, as well as on teaching translational skills with respect to these representations. Smaller class sizes, more staff attention, and total immersion were cited as essential. Financial concerns with respect to some of the activities did occasionally arise. An area of concern was the lack of adherence to the Individuality principle, which states students have unique backgrounds and abilities that should be considered when designing a lesson. Assessing student prior knowledge when designing and implementing lesson plans also was not indicated as a frequent practice in the program, or in the teachers' own classrooms according to participant data. In summary, according to participants' reports, the graduate program investigated modeled four of the five the principles proposed by Redish to a great degree, the exception being the Individuality principle. Based on the data contained in the survey, interviews, and portfolio submissions, recommendations for designers of future graduate programs for physics teachers were also made.

The parameter estimation ability of these detectors can be determined by simulating the response to predicted gravitational wave sources with instrument noise and searching for the signals with sophisticated data analysis methods. A possible source of gravitational waves will be beams of radiation from discontinuities on cosmic length strings. Cosmic strings are predicted to form kinks and cusps that travel along the string at close to the speed of light. These disturbances are radiated away as highly beamed gravitational waves that produce a burst-like pulse as the cone of emission sweeps past an observer. The detection of a gravitational wave signal from a cosmic string cusp would illuminate the fields of string theory, cosmology, and relativity. Gravitational wave sources also include coalescing binary systems of compact objects. Colliding galaxies have central black holes that sink to the center of the merged galaxy and begin to orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Previous LISA data analysis studies have assumed that binary black hole systems have a circular orbit or an extreme mass ratio. It is ultimately necessary to understand the general case of spinning black hole binary systems in eccentric orbits and how LISA observations can be used to measure the eccentricity of the orbits as well as the masses, spins, and luminosity distances of the black holes. Once LISA is operational, the comparison of observations of eccentric and circular black hole binary sources will constrain theories on galaxy mergers in the early universe.

Intensive study on DOA estimation algorithms was carried out to pinpoint the most suitable algorithm for the application of interest, and the spectral methods were chosen for this study. The outcome of the study consisted of generating a novel algorithm, spatial selective MUSIC, which is comparable in accuracy to other high resolution algorithms but does not require the intensive computational burden that is typical of high resolution spectral methods. Spatial selective MUSIC is compared in terms of bias, resolution, robustness and computational efficiency against the most widely used DOA estimation algorithms, namely, Bartlett, Capon, MUSIC, and beamspace MUSIC. The design, troubleshooting, and implementation of the hardware needed to implement the DOA estimation in a real case scenario was achieved. Two design phases were necessary to implement the center piece of the hardware needed to achieve DOA estimation. The 5.8 GHz 8 channel receiver board along with a casing that egg crates the RF channels for channel-to-channel isolation was designed and built. A National Instrument data acquisition card was used to simultaneously sample all the 8 channels at 2.5 MSPS, the data was processed using the PC interface built in LabView. Phase calibration that accounts for the overall system magnitude and phase differences along with a novel calibration method to mitigate the effects of magnitude and phase variations along with mutual coupling was produced during this research and was imperative to achieving high resolution DOA estimation in the lab. The DOA estimation capabilities of the built system was tested within the overall smart antenna system and showed promising results. The overall performance enhancement that the DOA estimation block can provide cannot however be fully realized until the beamforming block is revised to provide accurate and deep null placing along with a narrower beam width. This cannot be achieved with the current system due to limitations in the number of the array elements used and the granularity in the phase shifters and attenuators used in the analog beamformer.

Of special interest is running locomotion and its effect on impact shock. Impact shock magnitudes are often 2-3 times greater at the tibia during running compared to walking and have been reported to increase with decreasing grade conditions. The primary goal of this study was to determine the effect of downhill running on impact shock and asymmetry over varying grades. The secondary and tertiary goals of this study were to determine if there was significant symmetry difference between lower-limb preference groups and between training groups, respectively. Seventeen subjects (10 female, 7 male) were sampled from two populations with different types of downhill training (trained versus untrained) experience. The procedures included two visits, the first of treadmill familiarization and preference testing and the second for impact shock data collections. The data collection visit included a self-directed warm-up on the treadmill followed by a 16-minute running session that included four different running grade conditions (0%, -3%, -6% and -9%). Four samples of 5 consecutive tibial impact shock magnitudes (TIS) of each limb were collected at each running grade condition using piezoelectric accelerometers. Symmetry indices (SI) were calculated using TIS for left and right limbs from a previously established equation. The results indicate that measured SI was not significantly influenced by decreasing running grade conditions for all subjects. Also, there were no significant differences between preference groups across running grade conditions. A trend suggested differences between training groups across grade conditions, and analysis of covariance for stride length and step frequency indicated a significant difference between downhill trained and untrained subjects (p < - 0.038). Post-hoc analysis indicated a significant difference in left and right step length for downhill trained runners across grade conditions (p<0.05). It is possible that a learned unilateral forward stepping technique is present for those who frequently incorporate steep downhill running in their training. Further research is needed to determine ways of reducing SI for preventative measures, as well as determining possible longitudinal affects of asymmetry.

Three-hundred sixteen aspen stands were surveyed on the 560 kmÂ² study area. Secondary objectives were to determine if aspen density and recruitment were influenced by elk (Cervus elaphus) browsing, conifer establishment, and cattle (Bos spp.) grazing. A 202.3 mÂ² circular plot was established within each stand. All aspen stems within each plot were categorized into size classes: sprouts (< 1 m), saplings (1-2 m), recruitment stems (> 2 m and < 5 cm diameter at breast height), and mature stems (> 2 m and > 5 cm diameter at breast height). Recruitment stems and mature stems have grown above the height at which elk generally browse. Recruitment stems have attained this height in the past 10-15 years. Therefore, important measures of aspen stand sustainability are changes in recruitment stem density and density of all stems > 2 m tall across the study area. Individual stands were further categorized as sustainable if the number of stems > 2 m remained stable or increased from 1991 to 2006. Sixty-three percent of stands are not recruiting sufficient numbers of stems to replace aging overstories. Mean recruitment stem density across the study area did not change from 1991 to 2006. Stems > 2 m density is the most meaningful measure of aspen sustainability at the landscape level. Mean stems > 2 m density declined 12% from 1991 to 2006. The average annual loss of stems > 2 m is four times the rate of canopy cover loss in surrounding areas in Montana and Wyoming. Areas with the greatest elk densities had the lowest recruitment stem densities, which indicates that elk herbivory was the primary reason for the 12% decline in stems > 2 m density. Conifer establishment and cattle grazing in aspen stands also contributed to this decline. Even though elk numbers on the Northern Yellowstone Winter Range have declined since wolf reintroduction, aspen recruitment has not increased at the landscape level.

This project examines the integration of various interactive and visual activities to a traditional lecture-based high school anatomy class. The effects on short-term comprehension as well as long-term understanding along with student engagement and interest were studied. The effects of instructor comfort were also considered. This project made additions to the traditional lecture that was already being used in a high school Human Anatomy class in a small rural school in Iowa. The additions included podcasts, multiple pictures, short videos imbedded in the PowerPoint lectures, games used with iTouches, Webquests on the computer, and full length videos. Data were collected using preunit, postunit, and delayed assessments to determine student long-term and short-term comprehension. Also included were interviews of students and an on-line survey of students. The student interviews and an on-line survey were used along with an on-task checklist was used to gauge student engagement and student interest. In order to address instructor comfort, an instructor journal was used along with an interview and instructor assessment. The data indicate positive results as to students' short-term understanding and long-term retention of concepts. There was also an increase in student engagement and student understanding during the treatment units. Finally, there was an increase in instructor's comfort level during the treatment units.

During three lessons within one unit of study, tiered instructional materials were utilized and students were assigned to tiered learning groups. Likert-style surveys, student interviews, teacher observations, open-ended survey questions and unit test scores were used to collect data about the impact on student achievement, engagement and attitudes. Journal entries and teacher observations were used to determine how differentiating instruction impacted the teacher. Differentiating instruction improved the achievement of previously low-achieving students, but had mixed results for other students. Student attitudes were more negative following differentiated instruction. This treatment has mixed effects on student engagement and on the teacher.

Methods: Performance measures, body composition, and blood lipids were compared in redshirt football players who completed an eleven week protocol of either protein supplementation (S, n=6, 28 grams 3x/week) versus whole food protein (NS, n=9, 8-28 grams 3x/week). Subjects completed two 3-day diet records to determine nutrient intake. Results: Both groups reported meeting their protein requirements, but caloric intake was below the recommendation. Similar increases (P=0.003) in lean body mass were measured in the S (pre 72.2 Â± 6.6, post 73.0 Â± 6.3 kg) and NS groups (69.3 Â± 8.6, post 70.9 Â± 8.8 kg). No significant differences were found between the two groups in performance variables. For example, bench press increased (P=0.01) from 251 Â± 32 to 264 Â± 36 pounds in the S group and from 245 Â± 26 to 256 Â± 28 in the NS group. Conclusion: Both S and NS groups consumed on average at least the recommended protein intake and protein supplementation did not offer any performance or anabolic advantage over whole food protein.

The characteristics were studied using the dimensional parameters, friction factor and Colburn factor. The flow rate was varied over the range of 2000 < or = Re < or = 7000 in the turbulent and transitional regimes. The analyses were performed using a finite volume method. Comparisons with experimental data were performed to validate the numerical results. The geometrical parameters like the fin pitch, transverse pitch, wavy angle and wavy height were varied to study the effects of each individual parameter. Comparisons were also drawn to the laminar range, the effect of number of tube rows and the pattern in which the tube were arranged. The investigation shows that the effect of the number of tube rows on heat transfer coefficient is less after the number of rows is increased beyond four. It is observed that the reducing the fin pitch increases the heat transfer and pressure drop in both the configurations. The increase in transverse pitch resulted in a decrease in thermal and hydraulic characteristics. Response to the variation of wavy angle and wavy height was similar, as the wavy angle and wavy height were increased, the number of corrugations also increased resulting in higher heat transfer and a higher pressure drop. The critical balance between high heat transfer and low pressure drop was analyzed using the efficiency index for each parameter variation. The tube layouts in the staggered form were observed to be better than the in-lined layout for both the configurations.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were grown as single and dual-species biofilms in 1 mm glass capillary flow cells and monitored over time using confocal microscopy. Colonization and biofilm development patterns were associated with the fluid flow regime as evaluated using the finite volume analysis program CFX (ANSYS Europe, Ltd). The shear stress was shown to vary along the surface from a minimum near the edges to a maximum in the center of the flow path. Initial colonization by both species occurred at the outer edges of the flow path (low shear). P. aeruginosa was subsequently observed to migrate perpendicular to the flow direction towards the center of the flow path (high shear), but E. coli was never observed outside of the 200 micron outer edge. E. coli was unable to persist in the flow cell unless P. aeruginosa was present as a colonizing partner. Bio-volumes of each species were calculated using the Metamorph (Molecular Devices) image analysis program and are reported over time. P. aeruginosa reached a much higher final cell density when examining the entire surface (>99% total bio-volume), while an analysis of the outer 200 microns of the flow path revealed that in this microenvironment E. coli was observed to out-compete P. aeruginosa. (>50% total bio-volume). Additionally, significant advancement was achieved in describing accumulation and displacement at the single cluster level in developing (non steady-state) singlespecies, dual-labeled P. aeruginosa biofilms. User script was written in Metamorph software to allow for volume and centroid measurements of single clusters as well as pockets of cells within clusters. From measurements made over time the accumulation rates and displacement vectors were calculated. The distribution of cluster accumulation rates was observed to be upper bound by the planktonic growth rate for small cluster sizes, and was frequently observed to be negative (indicating net decrease in bio-volume) for larger cluster sizes. Expanding larger clusters were observed to physically displace neighboring cells and smaller cell clusters.

Sixteen collegiate cyclists (MeanÂ±SD; 23.3Â±3.5 years; 73.3Â±5.9 kg body mass; 4.54Â±0.34 L/min VO2MAX) were tested in five positions, each resulting in a different HA, on a cycling ergometer. The positions tested were centered around the mean HA corresponding to each cyclist's preferred position (P0), defined as the combination of trunk angle (TA) and seat tube angle (STA) in which each cyclist self-reported spending most of their time training on a bicycle. The five positions tested were the cyclist's P0 and positions resulting in mean HA's of +10Â°, +5Â°, -5Â°, and -10Â° relative to their Pâ. All cyclists were tested in each of the positions at a power output corresponding to 85% of ventilatory threshold. Sagittal-view kinematics for mean HA, TA, knee angle (KA) and ankle angle (AA) were recorded to confirm that HA was the only positional measurement being manipulated. Kinematic measures confirmed that mean TA, KA, and AA were not significantly different (P>0.05). Furthermore, it was confirmed that all HA's were significantly different (P>0.05) except between the positions +5Â° and +10Â° greater than that that corresponding to Pâ. No significant differences were found when comparing VO2SUB (P>0.05), heart rate (P>0.05), or minute ventilation (Ve; P>0.05) across the five positions. Nonsignificant quadratic trends were found for all three physiological measures across the five positions. It appears that VO2SUB, HR, and Ve are all minimized at positions equivalent to Pâ or +5Â° greater than that corresponding to Pâ. In the population tested, it appears that ""cross training"" may alter the relationship between VO2SUB and HA's greater than that corresponding to Pâ, thereby limiting comparison to a professional cyclist. The lack of significant differences between conditions indicates that the prediction algorithm created by Klippel and Heil (2001) may not be applicable to recreationally trained cyclists. According to the revised algorithm, a position that reduces TA, and therefore HA, results in a time trial position that maximizes ground speed for a majority of the collegiate cyclists tested."

How did slaves respond to the suffering they were forced to undergo? While some slaves did choose suicide, the rates appear to be surprisingly low. This is consistent with suicide rates for Africa and for people of African descent living in other areas of the world, and further supports the theory that a low suicide rate is an element of African culture. The overwhelming majority of African-American slaves chose to deal with their suffering through a variety of means, including resistance, external compliance and spirituality. When slaves did resort to suicide, it was apparently often in response to a deterioration in their circumstances or unfulfilled expectations. When the slaves developed dialog to address their suffering on an ideological level, they frequently did so through religious channels.

Students that participate in a Traveling School semester are inclined to make strong connections to the areas they travel in by learning about their surroundings. This study examined the impact of specific techniques that enhanced metacognitive reflection through field journaling techniques and formative assessment. These teaching techniques impacted not only students sense of place in southwestern Africa, but also student development of sense of place when they returned to their home town/region at the end of the semester. Each student participated in surveys measuring place attachment and place meaning for their home town/region. Additionally, students participated in interviews and questionnaires. Colleagues provided best practices of teaching with science field journals, as well as input on formative assessment techniques. Surveys pre and post treatment showed minimal overall change in student perceptions of sense of place. Interviews, observations and colleague feedback showed support that field journaling techniques enhanced student learning and connection to their home town/region.

However, this type of assessment may take time to plan, implement, analyze, and report back to students. Students need more immediate feedback in order for the assessment to be more meaningful. This research project focused on how effective the implementation of a Classroom Response System (CRS) into a middle school science classroom was as a method of formative assessment. The data collection took place over four complete units and alternated between non-treatment (without the CRS) and treatment (with the CRS). Data was gathered and analyzed from pre-and post-surveys, pre- and post-tests, student interviews, and teacher observations. The results showed that there was no significant gain in post-test scores, but students enjoyed using the CRS, thought that it helped clear up misconceptions, and considered it to be effective in determining if information was learned. The CRS was also effective in helping the teacher assess student knowledge gained and in helping the teacher assess teaching strategies and improve lesson delivery.

This project focused on developing a service learning group of college students to do science outreach with elementary students as a win-win opportunity to increase the content knowledge of all the students involved, give the college students the opportunity to empower the elementary students, and fulfill some of the needs of the college awareness program at an elementary school. Analysis of this project was completed using results from pre- and post-outreach experience questionnaires as a way to establish demographic information of the participants, get comparative awareness and interest of college and science information, and find some common points to make connections between the groups of students. Questionnaires were also used for the classroom teachers to understand how outreach benefited their classroom. Journals were utilized with college students as well as wrap-up meetings after each outreach experience in order to document personal experiences both as a mentor as well as students growing in their own content mastery.

In order to achieve this, parks must provide accurate, up-to-date scientific and preservation management information to visitors so that they gain a greater appreciation of parks by understanding what they protect. Although the Park Service has gone to great lengths to ensure scientific information is utilized in all management decision-making, no management documents or Park Service programs currently provide practical guidance or are adequately equipped to directly address communicating accurate and up-to-date scientific and preservation information to those who hold the future of parks in their hands: the public. Demands placed upon interpreters, who are the park staff primarily responsible for front lines visitor communication and services, are such that science communication can get lost in an array of other informational needs. Researchers, resource management, and visitor service personnel must create avenues or maximize current strategies to cooperate more effectively to communicate park science and management. Contrary to interpretive trends in the National Park Service, social survey and visitor studies show that communicating scientific and preservation information to visitors at parks and other institutions is expected and well-received. One specific underutilized form of both employee to employee and park to visitor communication is that of video media. Video allows a platform for scientists to speak directly to visitors, train other park staff, and encourage continued divisional cooperation. It can also provide an effective archival media library of information. A filmmaker must forge through bureaucratic and institutional realities in order to achieve successful scientific communication, but the benefits are immense when this work is crucial to help sustain the future of ""one of America's greatest ideas,"" the national parks."

Cultivation efforts resulted in the isolation of an Fe(II)-oxidizing chemolithotroph Metallosphaera yellowstonii MK1 T. The distribution and relative abundance of MK1-like 16S rRNA gene sequences was evaluated in 14 acidic geothermal springs containing Fe(III)-oxide microbial mats. Highly related MK1-like sequences (>99% sequence similarity) were consistently observed in Fe(III)-oxide mats across a temperature range of 55 to 80 Â°C. Quantitative PCR confirmed that organisms highly similar to strain MK1 comprised up to 40% of the total archaeal community of selected sites. Four additional isolates were obtained from thermophilic Fe(III) microbial mats including Sulfobacillus sp. MK2, Sulfolobus sp. MK3, Acidicaldus sp. MK5 and Crenarchaeota sp. MK4, which represents a new taxonomical lineage at the class level or higher. A draft genome has been assembled for M. yellowstonii strain MK1 and comparative studies indicate significant similarity to Metallosphaera sedula in regards to putative genes involved in iron and sulfur oxidation, carbon fixation, oxygen reduction and heavy metal resistance. Analysis of gene sequences reveal 7 heme copper oxidases (subunit I) and a variety of genes with possible importance in Fe(II) oxidation including the foxA-J gene cluster, a cbsA cytochrome b 558/566, and a novel sequence coding for a putative blue multi-copper protein (mco). Expression screens and reverse transcriptaseqPCR on samples from three ASC environments and in cultures grown autotrophically show that the fox gene cluster and mco are important when Fe(II) serves as the electron donor. Protein sequence analysis of foxC indicates a novel lysine-lysine or lysine arginine heme b binding domain and is likely the cytochrome component of a heterodimer complex with foxG as a ferredoxin subunit. Analysis of mco indicates a novel multicopper blue protein with two plastocyanin type I copper domains with only three homologous sequences found in Genbank. Both putative proteins likely play an important role in electron transport from Fe(II) to oxygen through Fox Proteins.	['oxidation']

In this study, I examine the imagery of two series of railroad advertisements for Yellowstone: the Northern Pacific Railroad's Wonderland campaign (1883-1910) and the Union Pacific Railroad's bear campaign (1923-1960). Despite the axiom ""you can't judge a book by its cover,"" clearly the creators of these brochures think otherwise; they intend these images to convey the essence of Yellowstone. Both sets of railroad imagery refer to Yellowstone as an unusual place, a wonder, a curiosity, even a freak show. The Northern Pacific Wonderland series emphasizes the geothermal and geological features, while the Union Pacific series features bears. The Northern Pacific brochures are in and of themselves a collection of fragmented pieces of Yellowstone, like a cabinet of curiosities, a pre-modern collection kept by European social elites. By focusing on the unique and the singular, they question the laws of nature. They co-opt the metaphors of gender and race in order to portray Yellowstone as an island untouched by humans that resisted the march of Progress and Civilization. This idea of Yellowstone's separateness is what gives it commercial value and situates it squarely within American commercial culture. The Union Pacific bear images feature a theme of performance and entertainment. The Park and its bears and geysers are now tamed and serve to entertain tourists; Yellowstone is now a mass spectacle. The bears are entertainers, clowns, and freaks; they question the boundary between human and animal and thus cause anxiety. But traditional gender roles are upheld, and issues of class are largely avoided, which serve to calm the anxiety that was raised. In both railroad representations, Yellowstone National Park serves as a foil, a place modern tourists can visit to define themselves. These representations of Yellowstone chart a shift from elitism to consumer democracy; clearly ideas about Yellowstone National Park, and representations of it, have changed and continue to change with the times."

A case study is developed about each of the five participants, in effort to answer the research questions, which are: How did critical reflection inform teacher capacity within the secondary science pre-service teacher population? What knowledge, skills, and dispositions facilitated secondary science pre-service teachers in developing a critically reflective practice? It is the author's expectation that by teaching these pre-service educators to develop their skills of critical reflection by using external methods of assessment such as videotaping, peer feedback, and student work, the participants in this study will increase and expand their capacity as teachers, or their ""innate potential for growth, development, and accomplishment"" (McDiarmid & Clevenger-Bright, 2008), and be better prepared to accomplish the goals that are expected of a master teacher. Data is collected from interviews, participant work samples, and observations from the researcher and other key individuals who worked with each participant, such as: the methods instructor, university supervisors, and cooperating teachers. Over the course of two semesters, the researcher developed a detailed description of each of the participants through analyzing passages selected from interview transcripts and student work samples for reflection type, factor of teacher capacity, and commonplace interaction group. The first outcome of this study includes an understanding of the relationship between critical reflection and teacher capacity and the knowledge, skills and dispositions that facilitate the development of a critically reflective practice. The second outcome of this study was the development of a new adaptation of a teacher interaction model (commonplace interaction groups) based on Schwab's Commonplaces of Educating. Lastly, three conclusions were drawn about the five participants in this study: There was a change in the participants' reflection level from the methods semester to the student teaching semester, most shifted their focus of reflection from teacher-self to teacher-student, and the weakest area of reflection with all participants was content / subject area and curriculum / standards."

Quality and cost effectiveness of care provided, as well as evaluation of patient outcomes have become high priorities for healthcare organizations. Presently, national healthcare initiatives have a strong emphasis on improving quality of patient care through reduction in patient readmissions. Not only are hospital readmissions negatively impacting the quality of life for the patients being readmitted, but they are also costly to healthcare organizations and the federal government. This project is an effort to align practices at Bozeman Deaconess Health Services (BDHS), a small community hospital, to meet the current and upcoming federal regulations created through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which aims to improve patient quality of care through reduced readmissions (Stone & Hoffman, 2010). This legislation mandates decreased reimbursement for services if a facility has high 30-day patient readmissions related to the three core measures of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Acute Myocardial Infarction and Pneumonia (PNM). A thorough assessment of the patient population at BDHS took place in the form of a retrospective review of patient readmission data from January 2009 through December 2010. Literature suggests common contributors to patient readmissions are poor communication, patients not following their care instructions, inadequate follow-up care and the location to which patients are discharged (Stone & Hoffman, 2010). Assessing the retrospective patient readmission population data for any trends and patterns, will better allow for appropriate intervention selection based on current available evidence for standards of care that reduce readmission rates. This project proposes policy and care process recommendations to incorporate the standard of care into nursing practice at BDHS in an effort to comply with federal regulations, decrease risk for financial penalties and most importantly to improve the quality of patient life by reducing 30-day readmission rates.

Guiding this study are two research questions, ""How does the goal implementation process as an element of the superintendent's organizational approach impact student success?"" and ""How does defined autonomy as an element of the superintendent's organizational approach impact student success?"" In 2002 the No Child Left Behind Act instilled a sense of urgency for the education community to implement an accountability reform placing an emphasis on schools to demonstrate effective instructional leadership at the district level. The sense of urgency caused by this political mandate, created a demand for data pertaining to the superintendent's instructional role and in 2006 Waters and Marzano completed their exhaustive quantitative meta-analysis on this subject. Their study discovered statistical data suggesting six responsibilities comprised of 51 observable practices of a superintendent that positively correlate with student success. Despite this effort, the lack of research concerning the qualitative data describing the superintendent's instructional role was still evident. The purpose of this qualitative single-case study was to collect data in a real-life, holistic environment to ascertain if the superintendent's organizational approaches did impact student success. To guide the data collection process, the six superintendent responsibilities were divided into two categories: defined autonomy and the goal implementation process. Waters and Marzano (2006) further broke these two categories into 51 observable practices (propositional theories) that statistically correlated with student success. Through Yin's (2003) guidance this researcher conducted interviews, purposeful observation and document analysis, to pattern-match data with empirical evidence. The findings suggest the organizational approaches of the superintendent did impact student success. Furthermore, new research ground was broken by discovering a process of five observable steps, that when followed will impact student success. The steps are: (1) Develop a shared vision, (2) Implement district goals, (3) Consistently communicate expectations, (4) Allow principals to implement, (5) Hold principals accountable through monitoring."

However, residence time is a useful index of hydrologic controls on ecosystem processes that may facilitate or limit the achievement of project goals. Interactions between the physical structure of streambeds and the patterns of flow through the channel determine hydrologic residence time and largely control solute transport and exchange among the various physical and biological components of the stream ecosystem. The influence of reach-scale channel reconfiguration on these complex interactions are not well characterized despite well-documented linkages between individual channel features, hydrologic retention, water quality, and in-stream habitat quality. This study documented changes in solute transport and variation in channel water velocity prior to and immediately following large-scale channel realignment along Silver Bow Creek in southwestern Montana. Channel restoration increased water residence time in the channel by increasing sinuosity, decreasing channel slope, and introducing frequent slow-moving pools. However, channel realignment yielded a reduction in the fine-scale variation in streambed topography. Therefore, post-realignment channel water velocities were more uniform, yielding a reduction in transient storage within the system, which could offset some of the beneficial effects of slower advective velocities. Restoration actions may be more effective at recovering normative hydrologic function if planning and design efforts consider the hydrologic effects and ecological benefits of fine-scale topographic variation and the bio-geomorphic processes that create and maintain such fine-scale variation over time.

It is not only separate from conventional fictional entertainment but it is also separate from the mainstream, or social documentary, tradition. The cross-blending of genres and the borrowing of technique and style from current ""modern documentaries"" should lead to a radical reinvention of the paradigm (i.e., a paradigm shift) of the science/natural history documentary. This essay will focus on three main areas of discussion: the rise of the modern documentary, a discussion exploring the characteristics of the current paradigm of traditional science films, and a survey of those projects that move towards a hybrid of science and entertainment. In looking at these films, we will consider my thesis film, Oil Eye for the Average Guy, (2007), which attempts to construct the new science documentary paradigm by using ""social documentary"" techniques to reach a larger audience."

Bringing together documentary film theory, science studies, and my own experiences in an academic program dedicated to science filmmaking, I deconstruct conventional science documentary, highlighting why I find inadequate the current questions, assumptions, and methods that guide the making of these films. I demonstrate how such questions, assumptions, and methods reinforce a gulf between science and the general public, and celebrate science as being an objective, all-knowing, extrahuman authority. My case study of 'The Science of Sex Appeal' is an attempt to call attention to that gulf (and related celebration of science) and provide an example of a more active and critical approach to viewing these science documentaries. I conclude that there is a need for makers of science documentaries to venture beyond the problematic conventions that guide these films, to work toward a new type of science film that can help reconstruct the relationships between science, science film, and the general public.

In this paper we discuss solar images and the results of our preliminary investigation of techniques that can be used to identify solar phenomena in images from the TRACE satellite. Being able to automatically identify various phenomena in solar images is of great interest for scientists studying phenomena on the sun. A set of characteristics that can be quickly extracted from solar images needs to be acquired. These characteristics are used to create classifiers for various phenomena contained in solar images. There are many obstacles that need to be overcome when extracting features and creating these classifiers. These include the inherent unbalanced data sets due to varying rates at which different phenomena appear and multiple phenomenon that could appear in each image. The classifiers that have been generated were used in the creation of an information retrieval system to make finding phenomenon solar images quick and easy.

The system functionality is such that it requires a stack of PCB's that power and support the radiation sensor. The stacked architecture introduces limitations in terms of mechanical stability that must be addressed. Mechanical characterization of system electronics must be performed in order to ensure that a new system will not fail under normal operation. This is especially true for systems subjected to harsh environments such as space flight. System level packaging must be employed in order to prevent damaging these systems. Factors such as weight constraints, system architecture, mechanical, and thermal loading must be considered, especially in space applications. During development of the sensor, different test beds were employed in order to characterize the radiation sensor and it's supporting electronic systems. The most common preliminary tests are high altitude balloon tests which allow the sensor to experience cosmic radiation at high altitudes, consistent with space flight operations. Each balloon test has mechanical and thermal criteria that must be met in order to survive flight. These criteria include resistance to vibration loading, as well as the ability to maintain system operational temperatures inside a payload as it ascends through the atmosphere. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate primary system architecture, system support structures, as well as the flight payload in order to determine if the system would survive preliminary, and future, testing. System level architecture and test payloads were designed using SolidWorks cad software. ANSYS FEA software was used to create thermal models which accurately simulated convective cooling through the atmosphere, and solar radiation loading on the exterior of the payload. Vibration models were performed in order to find the natural frequencies of the subsystem, as well as characterize the response to applied vibrations. Conclusions from each model show that the system will survive expected test loading at a wide range of vibration frequencies, and maintain a thermally stable environment in order to prevent damage to the internal electronic systems.

The intent of this study was to provide youth serving organizations with empirical data pertaining to the youth-adult partnerships within the Western 4-H Foundations included in this study. The population for the study included state 4-H foundations across the United States that included both adults and youth as voting members of the foundation director's board. The purposive study sample was state 4-H foundation boards from the Western 4-H region with youth and adults in formal decision-making roles. This research was conducted using a modified form of the Involvement and Interaction Rating Scale (IIRS). The IIRS instrument was organized based on three item groups that measured the following constructs: 1) Youth Involvement Indicators, 2) Adult Involvement Indicators, and 3) Youth-Adult Interaction Indicators. Each of the three sections incorporated semantic differential questions. Adult participants consistently had higher means through out each of the three IIRS constructs. Semantic differential questions nine, twelve, and thirteen were repeatedly statistically significant throughout multiple comparisons. Evidence revealed youth with prior youth-adult partnership experience held less positive views regarding youth-adult partnerships than did the youth with no experience in a youth-adult partnership. Youth believed adults were over-bearing and did not let the youth excel to their potential. Youth perceived adults were not actively listening to youth and were not taking youths' ideas seriously.

Few studies address rural women's health literacy. As major health decision makers for their families, rural women have influence over the health of rural populations. Vitamin D deficiency is suggested to be associated with chronic diseases such as rickets, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, this study was designed to highlight the unique rural women's circumstance surrounding health literacy about vitamin D. Nola Pender's revised Health Promotion Model (HPM) framed this descriptive survey. The survey included a quiz about vitamin D facts, as well as information about vitamin D practices and selected factors outlined by the HPM. In this study, relationships were explored between vitamin D health literacy and rural women's perceived access to health care services, as well as, the HPM selected factors. A sample of 400 women was randomly selected for the mailed survey, yielding a response rate of 41.2% (n = 126). The results showed that the majority of the participants had (a) marginal health literacy about vitamin D, (b) took widely varying amounts of vitamin D, (c) and got their information about vitamin D from their primary care provider, their most trusted source, and (d) reported access to health care services as easy. No significant relationship between access to services and vitamin D health literacy was found. The relationship between vitamin D health literacy and self-efficacy for health promotion was the only factor that showed significance. The study has implications for additional research about the relationship between self-efficacy for health promotion and health literacy of rural women. Additionally, research into rural women's relationships with their primary health care providers, may, in turn, improve rural women's health literacy. Implications for nurses include the importance of (a) obtaining histories about vitamin supplement dosages, (b) providing education about vitamin D; (c) addressing vitamin D and cardiovascular health, (d) and addressing rural women's health literacy needs verbally and through appropriately written material.

In this situation, if a time-varying voltage is applied at one end of the electrode, the voltage cannot be assumed to be uniform throughout the electrode because of the effects of resistivity. Determining the voltage in the electrodes as a function of time and position concurrently with the mechanical and electrical response of the piezoelectric material presents an added complexity. In this thesis the problem of the piezoelectric monomorph is considered. The piezoelectric sheet is PVDF, and the electrodes are PEDOT-PSS. As a first approximation the two problems of finding the voltage in the electrodes and the mechanical deformation in the piezoelectric material are decoupled. In order to determine the voltage distribution in the electrodes, the piezoelectric effects were neglected, which reduced the piezoelectric problem to a capacitor problem. Once the voltage function was determined the mechanical deformation of the PVDF sheet was calculated given the known voltage distribution as a function of position and time.

The female athlete has a complex system of steroid hormones that are continually changing. These sex hormones that fluctuate throughout each month may influence knee injuries, specifically the anterior cruciate ligament. The increased incidence in women is thought to be multifactorial, a combination of structural, anatomical, or biomechanical factors. The NCAA has reported that 75 percent of anterior cruciate ligament injuries are non-contact in competitive jumping or pivoting sports. In this study, the effects of the menstrual cycle on neuromuscular performance were investigated. Fifteen healthy females with regular menstrual cycles completed the various tests of this study for three phases of the menstrual cycle. All females were categorized as moderate or vigorous exercisers from an activity questionnaire. This study used a repeated measures experimental design; therefore, each participant served as her own control. The participants completed a series of two tests, including functional balance and fatigability. Each series was completed during three different phases of the menstrual cycle: menstruation, follicular and luteal. The participants used ovulation kits to predict the luteal phase. These phases were then verified through blood tests at each exercise session. The reaction time and balance test was performed with a BOSU wobble board placed on a force plate. A force platform was utilized to collect center of pressure data from the wobble board. The fatigue test protocol consisted of the participants performing in a pre-fatigue functional test, fatigue protocol and post-fatigue functional ability test. The functional test protocol consisted of two trials of four single-legged hop drills. It was hypothesized that all of the functional tests would have the greatest neuromuscular performance during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and for all of the tests to have differences between the pre- and post-fatigue trials. However, there were no significant differences in the functional tests over the menstrual cycle. There were differences in fatigue in the forward hop and figure eight tests, but the affect of fatigue on performance did not differ across menstrual cycle phases.

This essay posits that rhetoric is always a fundamental part not only of Western but of all societies. Maintaining such a constitution necessarily raises the questions how and why should educators acknowledge rhetoric's role in their instruction. Of the innumerable sites for introducing an increased focus on rhetorical instruction in universities, the most obvious should be first year composition classrooms since these sites are oftentimes 1) mandatory and 2) already situated, loosely or extensively, around rhetorical understandings of the classroom and the world in which the classroom exists. The methods of this heuristic essay are designed to draw attention to the need for composition instructors to increase instruction on and around rhetoric, both classical and modern, in order to gain a fuller understanding of how our culture exists within itself and in relation to other cultures. In order to illustrate this need, I offer an historical overview of the discipline, as first designed by classical rhetors beginning with the early sophists and Aristotle, which continued largely unchanged until the middle part of the nineteenth century and the inception of the Morrill Land-Grant College Act after which time emerged what is popularly termed modern rhetoric. By examining these two discrete eras in rhetoric's history, I hope to highlight not only the need for, but in fact the demand for revisiting both eras in contemporary composition classrooms. This essay also posits that rhetoric, historically and contemporarily, can have the most dramatic effect on changing the social conditions in which students and educators exist. This argument could not operate without the understanding that increased focus on compositional rhetoric is necessary today insofar as it strives to continually realize social and political change, which focuses primarily on achieving a greater sense of democracy in our educational systems and thereby our culture. Consequentially, the conclusions reached here are at best suggestive and, as the title suggests, heuristic.	['rhetoric', 'authorship']

The measure of marginal value constructed used hunters' opportunity costs of securing these licenses, and it does not rely on travel costs or surveys. The statistical inquiry used both ordinary least squares and the ordered pro bit procedure to measure hunters' marginal willingness-to-pay for various hunting characteristics. The results imply that higher demand for licenses is closely linked to unmeasured quality variables and that efficiency and revenue to the Colorado Division of Wildlife could be increased by reallocating hunting licenses from marginally lower valued characteristics to marginally-higher ones if reallocation is not costly.

Three approaches are outlined to fuse high affinity GdÂ³+ chelating moieties to the surfaces of protein cages. In the first approach, a metal binding peptide has been genetically engineered into the subunit of Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and to the small heat shock protein cage from Methanococcus jannaschii (HSP). The genetic fusion resulted in a 200x binding enhancement of GdÂ³+ to CCMV in comparison with wild type CCMV and metal binding functionality was added to the HSP protein cage. In a second approach DOTA-Gd was attached to CCMV by reactions with endogenous lysine residues on the surface of the viral capsids and resulted in r1 = 2,806 at 61 MHz for the 28nm diameter particle. Directed by the results of earlier generations of protein cage based contrast agents a next generation MRI contrast agent was designed. In this work a DTPA-Gd containing polymer was grown in the interior of HSP resulting in T1 particle relaxivities of 4,200mM-Â¹ sec-Â¹ for the 12nm particle. Relaxivity parameters were determined and this analysis suggests that the rotational correlation time of the GdÂ³+ chelate has been optimized while the exchange life time of GdÂ³+-bound water is slower than optimal. This synthetic approach holds much promise for the development of future generations of contrast agents. Throughout the evolution of the protein cage based contrast agents there has also been and evolution of our ability to characterize these cages with mass spectrometric techniques. Specifically refined methodologies are presented for QTof characterization of protein cage at the level of amino acids, protein subunits, protein complexes and their cellular expression. Furthermore, correct charge state assignment is crucial to assigning an accurate mass to supramolecular complexes such as protein cages analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Conventional charge state assignment techniques fall short of reliably and unambiguously predicting the correct charge state for many supramolecular complexes. We provide an explanation of the shortcomings of the conventional techniques and have developed a robust charge state assignment method that is applicable to all spectra.

Differential economic reform policies within the country divided China into three regions based on level of economic development: the coast, central China, and the west. Of these regions, the coastal region became a development priority during the early economic reform era. Cities in coastal areas benefit from the central government's reform policies. Among the coastal cities, Shanghai is a unique example of China's urbanization process. Throughout its history, Shanghai has played different roles: a fishing village, a sea port, a treaty port, a socialist city, a post-reform city, and a global city. Before focusing on Shanghai's development in the economic reform era (1978-present), a brief introduction to Shanghai's economic and population development is presented, dividing its history into periods of: before 1840, the foreign settlement era (1840-1943), the Nationalist Government era (1927-1949) and the Maoist period (1949-1976). This thesis investigates the urbanization process of Shanghai through examining economic restructuring and migration as the primary driving forces in changing Shanghai's industrial and population patterns in the economic reform era. A description of Shanghai's commercial, industrial and residential land uses in the economic reform era is provided as well as an examination of the impacts of economic restructuring and migration. Globalization as a trend is also shaping Shanghai's landscape.

Exported logs receive a greater price than domestically processed logs because of differences in quality, costs, and imperfect markets caused by regulation. A hedonic price approach is used to estimate implicit prices of timber sales characteristics, as well as supply and demand changes, and export restrictions. It is shown that the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act affects the price received in both domestic and export markets. Ceteris paribus, domestic timber prices decline, consistent with increased supply from the restrictions, and export prices increase, consistent with reduced availability. Both grade and species are significant factors in export price premiums. Export price premiums exist, even during a time when environmental concerns have resulted in drastic reductions in domestic timber supplies.

69417	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1741	The power and potential of performative documentary film	In this thesis, I argue the performative mode of documentary filmmaking is an emerging, intrinsically powerful and virtually unexplored weapon in the arsenal of science documentary. Through selected theoretical and academic writings, I examine origins and pathways of documentary film that ultimately lead to the performative documentary. I contrast the performative mode against a common paradigm that documentary, and particularly science documentary, demands a filmic text that embraces traditional conventions of narrative, realism, empiricism, causality and evidentiary truth claims. I then analyze the utility and application of common elements in performative documentary films including my performative science documentary, At the Risk of Being Smote. I show that viewers are uniquely able to assemble their own meaning from an adiachronistic structure of associated but fragmentary filmic events. Each person's mind weaves together patches of representation, fictive or not, into a tapestry of aesthetic response of knowledge and rhetorical truth. After discussing the current state of performative filmmaking tools and techniques, I look into the future of performative science documentary. Based on evolving trends and technologies, it is possible that audiences will not just view films, but rather participate in a multi-sensory experience. I conclude that performative science documentary is an immensely powerful, emerging tool that allows the viewer to perceive personal authorial control and voice that allows the boundary between discourse and intuition, between fiction and 'reality' to dissolve. Ultimately, this approach takes the filmmaker out of the role of interlocutor, giving the viewers a sense of invisible omniscience as they experience the filmic panopticon.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, these fall into two functional groups, type I phyA and type II phyB-E. Previous findings have shown that heterodimerization occurs in type II phytochromes and suggest that diverse dimer forms may have specific functions. The first objective of this study was to characterize the activities of individual phytochrome dimer combinations by developing a novel in vivo protein engineering system. Either obligate homodimers or heterodimers of phytochrome N-terminal regions were produced in phyB mutant plants. With this system, a highly active phyB/D heterodimeric form was shown to rescue the phyB mutant phenotype. Dimers of phyB/achromo-phyB, phyB/C, and phyB/E mediated organ-specific growth in de-etiolation by functioning differentially in cotyledons but not in hypocotyls. Light labile phyA is critical in the plant transition from skotomorphogenic to photomorphogenic growth. To investigate possible in vivo phyA heterodimerization with type II phys and the relationship between phy quaternary structure and signaling mechanisms, transgenic plants were generated that express different myc- tagged N- or C-terminal end fusion phyA proteins in a Landsberg erecta (Ler) phyA mutant or a wild-type background. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that phyA only forms homodimers with itself. Compared with fully active one myc epitope (myc1)-tagged phyAs, six myc epitopes attached to the ends of the N- or C- terminus of phyA impaired phyA-mediated far-red high irradiance (FR-HIR) signaling and also attenuated degradation in the light, indicating that alteration of phyA architecture may damage protein-protein interaction both in phyA downstream signaling and in its protein turnover. Overall, these findings have expanded the structurally complex R/FR sensing systems in plants and have implications for how plant growth and development may be fine-tuned through phy heterodimer-mediated tissue-specific growth or phy-modified activity.

The purpose of this project was to determine if adding digital photography as a tool for collecting data during outdoor field study would increase student engagement and also improve the quality of the data students brought back to the classroom. Too often my students would come in from the field with data that focused on surface or irrelevant features. They were unable to use their data to make connections to the ecology concepts we were learning in the classroom. During the non-treatment phase of the study, students recorded all of their data through drawings and written observations. While at their plots, students inventoried the vegetation present and also took specific measurements such as tree circumference, canopy cover and invasive plant cover. Before taking the cameras out to the field, students practiced with the macro settings to take close up pictures of vegetation brought into the classroom. During the treatment phase, students took digital cameras out to their new plots to inventory and measure plants. Student engagement data was measured using a self-assessment questionnaire, outside observer behavior checklist and teacher field journal. Although interest and engagement were high for most students during the entire study, students who were not initially engaged in the field study activities reported higher engagement levels when cameras were used. The outside observer and teacher journal data supported this finding. The quality of student data was measured using both the student self-assessment questionnaire and drawing or photo rubrics. Rubric scores increased when students used photographs, rather than drawings, to write observations. Students felt they had more to write about when looking at their pictures as compared to their drawings. Interestingly, students reported they wrote less while at their plots when they had the camera, relying on their pictures to tell the story of their plot. Using photos only slightly increased students' ability to positively identify their plants. Pictures lacked those complex features that would enable students to easily work their way through a basic key. To increase the complexity of observations, additional content knowledge about plant structure and ecology is needed.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

This feeling of hunger and uncertain ability to obtain food can have many consequences including food insecurity. Food insecurity is a growing problem which has severe implications for the individual and family. Among these implications are parental depression and child behavior problems. Additionally, there is increasing research pertaining to the uniqueness of rural locales and the increased risk for food insecurity in these areas. Although there is a growing body of literature examining food insecurity, no studies exist that examine the relationships between food insecurity, maternal depression, and child behavior among low-income families residing in rural locales. To shed light on this topic, this study examined the ways in which food insecurity-and varying levels of food insecurity-related to maternal depression and child behavior problems. This study also examined these variables as a function of rurality. And lastly, this study examined the combined effect of rurality and food insecurity on maternal depression and child behavior problems. Sixty-seven low income women were surveyed at either the local Food Bank or the Head Start program using a convenience sample. Respondents were asked to fill out an anonymous survey about their emotional well-being, child's behavior, and food security status. This study found a significant positive relationship between food insecurity and maternal depression, reconfirmed a well established link between maternal depression and child behavior problems, and showed a significant relationship between food insecurity status and child behavior problems. Overall, mothers who experienced more food insecurity also reported experiencing higher levels of depression and more behavioral problems with their children. Contrary to expectations, this study did not find support for a relationship between food security status and rurality. The best predictor of maternal depression in this study was food security status. This study also examined the best predictors of child behavior problems. While food security status was a significant predictor of child behavior problems on its own, when we added maternal depression in the analysis, food security status failed to account for the variance in child behavior outcomes. Implications of the findings for research, practice, and policy are discussed.

Researchers link fluency with retention, endurance and application. While several studies document the successful use of Precision Teaching in postsecondary classrooms, few report qualitative data. This study used a qualitative, phenomenological approach to examine the experiences of postsecondary faculty and their students with Precision Teaching. Interviews were conducted with 8 faculty members and 17 students. The faculty members had used Precision Teaching as part of their instructional strategy at a variety of postsecondary institutions throughout the United States. They taught courses to graduate students, undergraduates, and those seeking conditional college admission. Subject matter of courses included Precision Teaching itself, psychology, pre-calculus, and remedial reading, grammar, and writing. A series of open-ended questions guided the interviews, which were designed to encourage the participants to reflect on their experiences with Precision Teaching. Findings consisted of 6 faculty themes and 5 student themes. Although first impressions of many students were tentative or negative, faculty viewed the development of fluency as valuable for their students, and students' comprehension of course material and contribution to class discussions increased. As students gained experience, their outlook toward Precision Teaching improved, with many students reporting positive academic outcomes and positive affects. Students often struggled with the expectation of daily practice that often accompanies Precision Teaching, yet they valued the retention of material long after the course was over, in contrast to their experience of forgetting material from many classes. Several students reported adopting Precision Teaching as an individual study method for subsequent course work that contributed to their successful completion of courses and educational programs. Recommendations elaborate on the need to use Precision Teaching intelligently and responsibly.	['teaching']

It is important that administrators, faculty, and support staffs know what undergraduate college student-parents report as factors which are contributions or hindrances to their motivation to enroll and persist in achieving degree attainment success when compared to students who are not parents. The results of this study can be used by administrators, faculty, and support staffs as they recruit students, enroll students, retain students, revise current programs, and create new programs. In this study, three hundred and twenty three students were administered a survey (designed from two existing surveys) distributed one week before the semester ended, spring, 2011; ninety four parents and two hundred and twenty nine non-parents responded to questions about five persistence factors (enrollment barriers, decision to continue attending college, classroom experiences, student services and attainment goals) and one factor of motivation. The difference between persistence and motivation is that persistence questions were more specific to academics, while motivation questions were both academic and personal (intrinsic). The results showed parental status predicted persistence to continue attending college, classroom experiences and perceptions of student services. Parents showed higher levels of persistence survey scores than non-parents to continue attending college, classroom experiences and student services. Differences in motivation were unclear. In addition to student-parent status, individual student characteristics of age, marital status, and gender showed significance for predicting enrollment, attainment and student services. Non-traditional age students had lower levels of survey response for barriers in enrollment. Married students had lower levels of survey response for the attainment of goals. Females showed higher levels of survey response for student services. This study concludes that persistence factors were different between parenthood, age, marital status, and gender while differences in motivation remain unclear when comparing student-parents and students who are not parents.

Recent molecular progresses invite to an analysis of the events leading to the apparition of vertebrates and the underlying embellishment in gene regulation. In eukaryotes, the TATA-Binding Protein (TBP) has a central role in transcription initiation of most genes. TBP is comprised of a highly conserved DNA binding domain and, in vertebrates, it also contains a novel region: the N-terminal TBP protein coding sequence. The role of the TBP-N is largely unknown, but previous studies suggest that it is important for fetal survival. Most animals lacking the TBP-N (tbp Delta N/Delta N) die before weaning. The goal of the present work was to establish a deeper knowledge of the vertebrate-specific TBP-N. It was hypothesized that TBP-N could be involved in protein-protein interactions and that the high degree of similarity of TBP-N protein sequences in different species could correlate with similar functions. To test those hypotheses, two independent approaches were taken: (1) Protein-protein interactions involving the TBP-N via unbiased screens were characterized. (2) The mouse TBP-N was replaced by a similar and homologous TBP-N, in vivo, through homologous recombination. The TBP-N-replacement mutation was characterized through pathway analyses, bioinformatics, and whole-animal physiology. Screens for proteins interacting with the TBP-N of hagfish (hf), a basal vertebrate, uncovered hfPitxA. The Pitx family of transcription factors are proteins important in vertebrate development. The mouse paralogs of hfPitxA, Pitx1 and Pitx2, were found to interact with the mouse TBP-N. Moreover, the interaction appeared functional as it regulated the expression of nppa, a known target gene of Pitx2. In vivo replacement of the mouse TBP-N with the similar hfTBP-N did not affect the survival. Gene expression analysis indicated that lipid metabolism pathways were affected in animals lacking the TBP-N or when the hfTBP-N was present. Further analyses pointed toward a potential defect in insulin response and an abnormal hepatic fat storage. The data presented here argues in favor of an important role for TBP-N in vertebrate-specific gene regulation. More specifically, it is likely involved in heart development and in regulation of lipid metabolism.

These materials were made using synthetic approaches, which utilized the native protein architecture as an initiation point and size constrained reaction vessel for the piecewise formation of the second material. In the first illustration of this approach, a protein-P t composite was formed, where the protein cage has been modified to include a metal binding moiety for improved synthesis of metallic P t nanoclusters, which were shown to be an active H 2 catalyst. This composite was analyzed by native mass spectrometry to determine the number of P t ions bound prior to mineralization and to measure the distribution of species after mineralization, which provided a unique view into the mineralization process. The second illustration was a material synthesized using the cage-like protein architecture as an internal guiding synthetic scaffold for the formation of a coordination polymer core inside the protein cage. The construction of this coordination polymer was unusual in that unlike normal coordination polymer synthesis, coordination of the metal preceded formation the ditopic ligands, which were afterwards completed using azide-alkyne click chemistry. Finally, a collection of protein-polymer composites were developed, which utilized a living radical polymerization method, atom transfer radical polymerization, to form internal polymer cores. By labeling one of these protein-polymer constructs with a Gd based MRI contrast agent a material with vastly improved relaxivity was made. The development of each of these three types of composites served to improve our understanding of the natural systems, from which they are derived, and provide a basis for further development of advanced multicomponent nanomaterials.

Physics is a subject which lends itself to inquiry teaching, where students discover the answers to scientific questions rather than being told the answer. The study involved twelve high school physics students. Student interviews, surveys, and conceptual assessments were used to gauge the effectiveness of this teaching strategy. I collected data and compared two treatment units (inquiry) to a nontreatment unit (traditional). Results were expressed as a percent change in student learning. I also investigated the effect of inquiry teaching on my feelings about teaching, student motivation, and student engagement. The results of my project indicate that students learn effectively through both inquiry and through traditional teaching. Student understanding results did not differ dramatically between comparison units. However, inquiry may be more engaging for students than traditional lecture style teaching. Some students experienced a decrease in motivation while others students experienced an increase in motivation, possibly indicating the existence of multiple intelligences and different learning styles or a lack of experience with the rigors of inquiry. My enjoyment of teaching increased when I taught through guided inquiry. I enjoyed seeing the students discover on their own what I was trying to teach them. I also believe that the inquiry style will better prepare students for standardized tests which emphasize process skills versus content knowledge.

In order to determine the effectiveness and transferability of early start programs, post-secondary education administrators and high school counselors need to have an in-depth understanding of students' early start experience. This qualitative case study examined the early start experience from the viewpoint of 20 college students who previously participated in an early start program such as Advanced Placement or dual credit while in high school; the students interviewed attended the same four-year research university. With the students' consent, eight mothers of the former early start participants were interviewed to gain an understanding of their view of the early start experience. In addition, a director of admissions at a four-year research university was interviewed to provide insight on the early start experience from a post-secondary education perspective. Document analysis of student academic transcripts evaluated the transferability of early start courses to a four-year research university. This research discovered that students participated in early start because they want to be challenged while in high school. The students took it upon themselves to initiate the early start conversation with their parents. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, students in this study felt their high school teachers played more of a role in the early start experience than their high school counselor. The analysis of the academic transcripts revealed that early start courses fulfilled general education and elective credits at this one institution. The in-depth exploration of the early start experience provided insight on how secondary education and post-secondary education may work together to continue providing an early college experience for high school students.

Additionally, this project looked at the effects of the 5 E Learning Cycle on teacher instruction. Instructional lessons were planned and presented using the 5 E Learning Cycle while pre-, mid.-, and post- formal and summative assessments were collected to show its effects on students and the teacher. Through these assessments, science learning of the state standards increased, while the ability to understand and apply inquiry got better at first, but then showed a decrease in getting better. The teacher's role in the classroom changed, as did the way she planned and presented each lesson and guided the class. Promoting inquiry in the classroom increased.

This finding is usually attributed to von Restorff (1933) which is when an item is isolated against a homogenous background; the learning of that isolated item is enhanced or facilitated. Block (2009) found that intent to remember a specific type of picture also enhances the subsequent recognition of it, and he suggested that increased attention to target stimuli is implicated. The three experiments reported here clarify the possible link between the attentional processes involving both of these effects.

For the second semester of their senior year, students watched video lectures outside of class and completed assignments during class time. Students reported lower stress levels in this type of classroom environment compared to other classes. While semester grades showed improvement, exam grades did not show significant improvement. Overall, students displayed positive feelings towards the treatment and enjoyed the associated benefits of being able to choose their own assignments and explore concepts they found interesting more in-depth.

The purpose of this study is to compare alternative methods commercial cow-calf operators could utilize to acquire bred beef heifers. It is hypothesized that Montana ranchers could decrease the expected present cost of obtaining bred heifers by choosing acquisition alternatives appropriate to the current and lagged state of the cattle and feed market. A behavioral price model for Montana bred beef heifers is theoretically developed and estimated. Time series equations that predict bred heifer price and feeder heifer price are estimated. Montana barley and alfalfa price series are combined in a weighted sum to form a price series used to construct a time series equation that will predict feed ration price per day for beef heifers. These time series equations are combined to form a system of three equations that jointly predict bred heifer, feeder heifer, and feed ration price. Dynamic programming is utilized to compare the expected present cost and determine an optimal decision rule among twelve distinct strategies for acquiring bred beef heifers. Stochastic state variables are current feeder heifer price, lagged feeder heifer price, and current feed ration price. Transition probabilities for the stochastic variables are calculated from the system of three time series equations. Expected immediate costs for producing bred heifers include feeding, breeding, pregnancy testing and marketing costs. The conclusion drawn from the dynamic programming model results is Montana ranchers can decrease the expected present cost of acquiring bred heifers. When feeder heifer price is decreasing the decision to sell heifer calves immediately after weaning and purchase bred heifers prior to calving is optimal. If feeder heifer price is relatively unchanged or slightly increasing retaining heifers over the winter, selling them in the spring, and purchasing bred heifers is the optimal decision policy. Raising bred heifers is optimal only when feeder heifer price is sharply increasing.

Contaminated soils in the Basin are often acidic and highly enriched with the trace elements cadmium, copper, arsenic, lead, zinc, and others. Natural plant colonization is often impaired, as evidenced by barren areas that are so phytotoxic that normal germination and establishment cannot occur. One reclamation strategy being used is in-place treatment with soil amendments including lime and other products. This provides a more hospitable substrate for plants by raising pH and lowering the mobile and bioavailable fraction of metals. Since contaminants are not removed with in-place treatment, short-term and long-term effectiveness of the soil amendments and the vegetative cover continue to be debated. Several experimental plots within the Basin have been treated in-place, but have developed plant communities of limited diversity where some seeded species failed to establish or persist. A greenhouse pot study was used to determine site-specific toxicity thresholds across a dilution of total metals and arsenic that significantly reduced plant growth. Two sets of contaminated and reference soils collected from the Basin were mixed to obtain metal and arsenic concentration gradients from 244 to 5885 and 250 to 7521 mg/kg, respectively. Five native and two non-native grasses were grown in separate trials. Percent emergence, shoot height, total biomass and root mass ratio were analyzed. Sensitivity of the seven grasses varied according to the response measured and dilution series. Most species showed significant reductions in total biomass and shoot height when the sum of total metals and arsenic was 559 to 1900 mg/kg. Redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth) was the most tolerant species, not displaying significant decreases in total biomass until the sum of total metals and arsenic reached 5783 mg/kg. Because the study used contaminated environmental samples and nonagricultural species, the results may better estimate site-specific ecological risk and toxicity thresholds for in-place treated soils in the UCFRB over studies performed in sand with inappropriate surrogate species.

Having become subservient to sight, we have mostly forgotten how to design for other sensory experiences. If we ask our clients a specific line of qualitative questions, we might better understand how the spaces we create can perform from an experiential standpoint, thereby enabling us to create richer, deeper experiences of place. Furthermore, I propose that we can use the information garnered from this questioning to begin an architectural design by working from details at the micro scale and using them to drive the larger formal issues of our designs. My intent was to synthesize responses from interviews to determine significant qualities of space. These responses were then used to identify details of chief importance in engaging sensory experiences through the project design. These details were coalesced to formulate key experiences of the larger design, which allowed me to approach the grander gestures of the project as a whole. However, rather than focus on a fully-resolved design for the site and the building, my chief concern was focusing on the aforementioned details of the design in order to support the proposed methodology. The project focused on three key spaces that were often referred to in interviewees' responses: the gathering space, the outdoor areas, and the study rooms. At the conclusion, I found that it was in fact possible to start from the smallest microcosm of the building design, the human scale, and work outwards. This became a simultaneous exploration of scales (human, the scale of spaces, the building scale, and the site) through four facets: 1) tactility, 2) light, 3) flow, and 4) social interaction. I've found that focusing on these facets through the lens of interviewees' responses allows architects to create experiences of space centered around people and the human body. Key questions arose at the conclusion: At what point do you move beyond iterations to a resolved design? How does one quantify whether or not the design meets the experiential needs of the users? Answers to these questions necessitate deeper exploration still.	['culture']

A four-equation system of supply and demand functions is used to estimate parameters that measure the price relationship of U.S. and Canadian hard spring wheat in each market. The models were estimated with three stage least squares procedures. Besides the parameters measuring price movement of hard spring wheat in the South Korean and Indonesian markets, results are generally not statistically different from zero. Supply and demand equations in the Japanese market have common estimated parameters that are the correct sign and statistically significant. Econometric results of the Japanese market indicate that the United States and Canada are acting as noncolluding oligopolists. Comparing the mixed results of the South Korean and Indonesian markets with those of the Japanese market suggest that the United States and Canada are not competing as strongly in the Japanese market as they are in South Korea and Indonesia.

With the explosion of video for change organizations and projects both filmmakers and funders have a growing need to make a solid connection between the power of film and its concrete impact. This thesis will set forth the key principles for successful advocacy filmmaking and explore how the International Conservation and Education Fund's (INCEF's) Great Ape Public Awareness Project incorporated these principles into its approach to advocacy filmmaking. This exploration will be accomplished via a review of the organization's methodology combined with field observations from the first half of the 2008 field season in the northern villages of the Republic of Congo. This thesis will also highlight the successes and challenges INCEF faced during the three stages of advocacy filmmaking: 1) production; 2) strategic dissemination; and 3) impact evaluation, in an effort to inform the creation, implementation and evaluation of future advocacy video projects.

In higher dimensions there is still progress to be made towards obtaining a more complete understanding of the relationship between the map and its average rotation. In this dissertation, we explore a class of homeomorphisms on the d dimensional torus T d that preserve each leaf of a foliation of the torus into parallel lines densely winding on T d. First the rotation sets of such maps are explored, with particular emphasis on those maps that have a single fixed point; zero is necessarily an element of those rotation sets. Conditions are found that show when these maps have a non-trivial rotation set. When such maps, with non trivial rotation sets, are created as the time-one map of a flow it is shown that the existence of merely two, or infinitely many ergodic measures is connected to the solvability of a cohomological equation. An example, of the infinitely many ergodic measure case, is provided. Finally, we explore on T Â² maps without a fixed point that happen to also have a point whose orbit has bounded deviation from the mean rotation. Such maps are seen to be akin to circle maps with irrational rotation number; the irrationally sloped foliation leads to the map being semi-conjugate to an irrational translation of T Â².

The model can be used at any grade level and subject area and involves the students using critical thinking and metacognitive skills. A nontreatment and three treatment units were compared by using pre and postassessments, surveys, interviews with concept mapping, and teacher observations to determine the effectiveness of the concept attainment model on students' understanding of the biology concepts, thinking skills, and attitudes and motivation. The treatment units included several concept attainment activities per unit on bacteria and viruses, protists, and ecology. Teacher motivation and attitudes were assessed by a survey, teacher journal, and peer observations. The data indicated that students' understanding of the concepts and thinking skills did increase with the use of the concept attainment model. Students thought about their thinking process and ways that they learn while doing concept attainment activities. Student attitudes and motivations were slightly increased during the treatment units as many students perceived the concept attainment activities as being a game. Teacher motivations and attitudes increased during the creation and implementation of the concept attainment lessons. The concept attainment model is an effective teaching method to engage students in creating their own definitions. The lessons helped to increase understanding of the concepts, engaged students to think about their learning, and had a positive effect on their attitudes and motivations in class.

Team members from different functional departments of the company interact in every phase of development activities to design products and processes concurrently. This concurrent strategy increases the complexity of product development and design processes and makes teams difficult to organize. Without effective task coordination and team organization, the lack of communication and cooperation among team members in a large group of tasks could seriously delay the project completion. This research provides an integrated solution to overcome these difficulties. This research aims to model both project tasks and team members for the task-member assignments. To accomplish this, we develop an integrated framework that includes three major components: a project task model, a team member model and a task-member assignment model. The project task model optimizes the complex task structure using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), while Design Structure Matrix (DSM) identifies the three major project task types: independent, dependent, and interdependent. The team member model provides a quantitative representation for three important team member characteristics, namely functional knowledge, teamwork capability and working relationship. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and personality profiling using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) are used to obtain ratings of team member characteristics. According to the project task structure, quantified team member characteristics, and each member's workload schedule, the task-member assignment model accomplishes the ultimate goal of this research - assigning the right team members to the right tasks at the right time. The effectiveness of the developed methodology is demonstrated by an illustrative example.	['project management', 'management']

But can experienced teachers improve their practice through their role as a mentor in a mentoring program? Although anecdotal evidence suggests that mentor teachers grow professionally through mentoring, there is limited research supporting this claim. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the professional growth of mentor mathematics teachers participating in an online content-based mentoring and induction program, e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS). In specific, this mixed-methods study sought to determine what aspects of eMSS contributed to mentor professional growth and over what domains this growth occurred. Because the mentoring program was online, teaching and learning were dialogue driven and text-based. Therefore, this study also sought evidence of the mentor teachers' professional growth in the online dialogue and commentary they provided for analysis. Finally, active engagement in professional development is hypothesized to be a precursor to professional growth and development. Using mentors' activity level as a measure of engagement, this study also sought to determine if activity level was related to mentors' perceived professional growth. The results of this study indicate that mentor mathematics teachers did grow professionally as a result of participating in eMSS. The experienced teachers reported growth in all assessed domains, particularity in their reflective practices, professional engagement and leadership, pedagogical knowledge, and in their access to instructional resources. Two predominant avenues of professional growth were cited as being important including reflection on practice and communicating with other mathematics educators. Program flexibility was also named as an important facilitator of professional growth. Finally, it seems that a mentor's activity level does positively relate to perceived professional growth and that much growth occurs ""behind the scenes"" and may not be evident in participants' posts. In conclusion, implications of the findings and how the findings may be used to purposefully design mentoring programs to assist in the professional development of mentor mathematics teachers are offered to program designers. Recommendations for further research are also suggested."	['employees', 'education', 'school employees', 'civilization', 'auxiliary sciences of history', 'persons', 'teachers']

This is a result of weathering and microbial oxidation of pyretic minerals present in mine tailings. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), which are often indigenous to mine tailings, have demonstrated promising potential in metabolically raising effluent pH and immobilizing metals through precipitation and biomineralization. The addition of an organic carbon source has the potential of stimulating the SRB and reducing ARD at its source. Often the success of a process based on implementing endemic microbial consortia for in situ bioremediation is highly dependent on an understanding of the community structure and potential activity of microbial community members when provided a specific substrate. The goal of this research was to identify viable methodologies that can be used to select and monitor successful bioremediation treatments. Differences in microbial community structure and activity of batch cultures inoculated with tailings were observed for independent treatments of whey and lactate as carbon sources. Community response to whey treatment of bench-scale columns was also observed. Development and optimization of DNA extraction and purification methods was required for the highly contaminated tailing samples. Microbial community structure and phylogeny were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and automated sequencing. The methods used in this paper were successful at identifying pre- and posttreatment community structure of endemic microbial populations. Shifts in community structure were observed in treated columns and treated batch cultures. Sulfate reduction in treated batch cultures was highly variable between samples, suggesting microheterogeneities in community structure of sampled tailings. Selection for specific phylogenies was evident with respect to carbon source treatment, culturing conditions, and sampled inocula. Variability in community structure was roughly correlated to sulfate reduction in individual organic carbon treatments. Resulting community profiles were highly dependent on methods used in obtaining, amplifying, and isolating community DNA of phylogenetically distinct populations. The success of implementing molecular techniques to observe and optimize bioremediation is ultimately dependent on the methodology used.	['science', 'mathematics', 'dynamics', 'mechanics, analytic']

In an attempt to reverse this trend, beaver (Castor canadensis) were reintroduced in Eagle Creek in 1991. Beaver promote aspen suckering through their dam and lodge building activities. In 2005, I assessed the long-term effects of beaver on aspen stands and the associated riparian area in the Eagle Creek Drainage. Aerial photographs taken in 1990 and 2005 were used to compare changes in riparian area vegetation where beaver were reintroduced. Aspen canopy cover decreased (P<0.05) from 43% to 25% on Eagle Creek (29 ha) between 1990 and 2005. Willow (Salix spp.) cover increased (P<0.05) from 10% to 14% and alder (Alnus incana) cover and water surface area doubled during the same period. Aspen recovery was estimated by comparing vegetative changes among control sites with <10% beaver use (n = 5), active beaver sites (n = 6), sites abandoned for 1-3 years (n = 7), sites abandoned for 4-6 years (n = 4), and sites abandoned for 7-11 years (n = 5). Thirty, 1-m2 plots were used to determine aspen density and one 60-m2 belt transect was used to calculate size-class distributions at each site. Aspen stem densities in active sites and sites abandoned by beaver for 1-3 years were similar (2.6/m2) and increased (P=0.01) compared to all other sites (1/m2). In addition, sprout and sapling densities were greater (P=0.01) in these sampling areas. However, aspen suckers were not able to grow taller than 2m on sites absent of beaver for 4-11 years, which prevented aspen recovery. Ungulate herbivory on aspen was assessed by comparing differences in 14 fenced (3 x 3m) and unfenced (3 x 3m) areas over 2 growing seasons. Growth rate of aspen suckers was greater (P=0.001) in fenced areas (32cm/year) compared to unfenced areas (0.25cm/year) due to ungulate herbivory. Total ungulate density for Eagle Creek was equivalent to 17.6 elk/km2 in the winter of 2005-06. Beaver activity stimulated the growth of aspen sprouts and saplings, but ungulate herbivory prevented successful aspen recovery in Eagle Creek.

The uni-directional solidification and subsequent freeze drying of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based aqueous cast tapes is being evaluated for various applications including fuel cells, filtration/separation membranes, and catalyst supports. The degree of pore divergence, pore packing, and pore orientation can be actively tailored by altering the solids loading, freezing rate, and tape pulling speed. The effects of solids loading and freezing rate is discussed with respect to morphology of ice growth. SEM and density data is reported to establish the breadth of tailorability and extent of anisotropy in the frozen tapes. The freeze cast structure of ceramic materials is highly porous. The production of freeze cast, YSZ-based tapes include tap casting techniques and high temperature sintering steps. SEM analysis is displayed at varying angles relative to casting direction to provide further insight of the morphology of these materials. Results of varying solids loading and freezing temperature studies are discussed in detail. Compressive strength data by ASTM standard methods was resultant of concentric ring-on-ring testing and is further explained. Freeze cast structures appear to be potentially desirable over traditional pore formers for various applications.

This project used student-centered, problem-based learning to regain their attention and make them more accountable for their learning in my AP Â® Environmental Science course. I also looked at the affect it had on their study strategies, motivation, and metacognition in class, along with my own attitude about teaching. This project investigated the effect that problem-based learning had on understanding of AP Â® Environmental Science topics when compared to a traditional teacher-centered lecture based unit. Students understanding of material was assessed using pre and postunit assessments, along with formative assessments, and concept map interviews. Other methods of data collection were used to understand changes in student's attitudes, study methods, and metacognition in all units. The attitude of students was determined through using attitude surveys and individual interviews. Student surveys along with interviews helped understand the changes in study habits and metacognition. Observations made throughout the units also supplied data to analyze these areas. Results indicated a mixed effect on each of the areas addressed. In the first treatment unit there was a positive trend, with improvement in attitude, attainment of knowledge of concepts, and metacognition, but in the second treatment the trend was opposite. The same observation can be made with my attitude toward teaching that in the first unit it was more positive while in the second unit it was more negative.

No differences in ADG (P = 0.46; average 1.78 kg/d) or final weight (P = 0.23; average 498 kg) were detected due to cultivar. Barley cultivar did not affect DMI (P = 0.80; average 9.8 kg/d), or feed efficiency (P = 0.63; average 18.3 kg gain/100 kg of feed). Growing environment did not influence ADG (P = 0.17; average 1.77 kg/d), or final weight (P = 0.20; average 498 kg). Heifers fed diets containing irrigated barley had lower (P = 0.009) DMI than heifers fed diets containing dryland barley (9.3 vs. 10.3 kg/d, respectively). Feed efficiency was higher (P = 0.001) for heifers fed diets containing irrigated barley than for those fed dryland barley (19.8 vs. 16.8 kg gain/100 kg of feed). Barley NEm (P = 0.38; average 2.15 Mcal/kg) or NEg (P = 0.38; average 1.46 Mcal/kg) were not affected by cultivar. Irrigated barley NEm and NEg (2.31 and 1.61 Mcal/kg, respectively) contents were higher (P = 0.001) than dryland barley NEm and NEg (1.98 and 1.32 Mcal/kg, respectively) content. No differences (P > 0.06) in carcass characteristics were detected due to barley cultivar, growing environment or their interaction. Dry matter digestibility was higher (P = 0.02) for diets containing Valier barley than for diets containing Harrington barley (77.6 vs. 74.9 %, respectively). Starch digestibility was not affected (P = 0.13) by cultivar. Growing environment did not affect (P > 0.06) nutrient digestibility. In summary, irrigated barley had higher starch content and lower ADF content than dryland barley. The higher starch content of the irrigated barley resulted in the irrigated barley having higher energy content than dryland barley, which resulted in the irrigated barley being a more efficient feed source.

The hybrid unit, which combines traditional classroom instruction with the best-of online course tools and activities, was implemented into a 7th grade science elective classroom located in rural Montana over the course of 16 weeks. The host teacher possessed a doctorate in education and concurrently instructed online graduate courses in Action Research. Neither the host nor students had prior experience with hybrid instruction. The hybrid course topic focused on climate science and was designed congruent to 21st century technology standards. The unit included a wide variety of vibrant online activities coupled with face-to-face classroom interactions and hands-on science labs. All student work, whether online or face-to-face, was completed digitally and uploaded within the online course. Data was collected from a variety classroom assessment techniques including student performance on summative assessments, frequent student surveys, host teacher journaling, host teacher interviews and surveys, researcher observations, and researcher journaling. Partial member checking was utilized for verification of data collection and analysis. In the end, an overwhelming majority of students preferred hybrid instruction to traditional classroom instruction. A majority of students found the course to be fun, easy to navigate, and they felt they remembered more from hybrid than traditional lecture or bookwork. Students showed strong academic gains in climate science topics, especially historically low performing students. The host teacher enjoyed the diverse curricular activities and approved using the unit again in future elective classes. The host also indicated interest in experimenting with creating his own hybrid course in future academic years once technology resources became more readily available. As a result of the hybrid unit implementation, the host teacher also noted secondary observations in students' improved computer literacy, problem solving, and expository writing skills. At the outcome of this study, it was evident that hybrid instruction benefits students in a variety of manors thus instructors should consider this methodology as technology becomes increasingly available within classrooms.

Currently there are no effective management procedures for mitigating the effects of this disease because it is not fully known why the parasite has severe effects in some trout populations while remaining fairly benign in others. Characteristics of the parasite, hosts, environment, and their interactions, may partially explain varying responses of wild rainbow trout populations to whirling disease. The goal of this study was to examine possible contributors to, and indicators of, stream degradation and their relationship to whirling disease risk. Specifically, the objectives were to quantify relationships between whirling disease risk and 1) land use 2) biological stream integrity and 3) physicochemical parameters within four major drainages in western Montana. The hypothesis was that whirling disease risk is influenced by anthropogenic land use practices that create favorable habitat for the oligochaete worm host, Tubifex tubifex, which is reflected in the biological integrity and physicochemical features of the stream. Whirling disease risk was quantified by the severity and prevalence of infection in caged sentinel trout. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to model land use (e.g., agriculture, mines) within drainages. Bioassessment metrics specific to Montana (e.g., total taxa richness, sensitive taxa richness) and those directly related to whirling disease (e.g., density of T. tubifex) were used to assess biological stream integrity. Physicochemical characteristics included those associated with favorable T. tubifex habitat (e.g., substrate), and those that have been associated with an increased incidence of whirling disease (e.g., temperature). Importance of predictor variables was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation and regression tree analyses. Final regression trees identified the proportion of riparian forest, road density, oligochaete density, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri density, Plecoptera taxa richness, and the proportion of Plecoptera as the most important predictors of whirling disease risk among drainages. A greater understanding of the linkage between land use, biological stream integrity, physicochemical features and whirling disease risk is needed before effective management techniques can be implemented in Montana watersheds and elsewhere.

This seemingly simple reaction between protons and electrons necessitates the utilization of some of nature's most complicated organo-metallic cofactors. Remarkably, two evolutionarily independent types of enzymes capable of catalyzing this reaction exist - termed the [NiFe] and [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The biosynthesis of the cofactors harbored by these enzymes poses questions as to the assembly pathways involved in constructing hydrogen competent catalysts, and herein research as to the biosynthesis of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase active site is presented. Data as to the protein components involved in this process are presented which include the development of an E.coli based expression system for hydrogenase maturation protein factors, their isolation, and the first functional assignment of two of these proteins. The HydF protein is shown to be operative as an H-cluster intermediate bearing scaffold for [FeFe]-hydrogenase active site assembly, and the HydG protein is demonstrated to be responsible for the formation of cyanide and carbon monoxide from tyrosine. In addition, observations of a novel radical SAM enzyme is reported in conjunction with its putative involvement in the biosynthesis of the Hmd-hydrogenase found in methanogens. Together, these observations contribute to understanding biology's ability to construct complex organo-metallic cofactors, and lay a foundation for the consideration of the evolutionary events that led to the biological ability to assemble complex metallocofactors.

Further, confessional poetry is often dissected with such a finite Freudian, Bloomian, Jungian, etc., scalpel by reviewers, pundits, and critics, that the true roots of the poems are constantly overlooked; that of the essence of mythology. Critics, scholars, and purveyors of Anne Sexton continually refuse to acknowledge the influence of mythologies, the inspiration of previous and contemporary poets, and that Sexton admittedly relied on myths to write poetry. Utilizing Northrop Frye's theory that all of literature is displaced myth, I have displayed that so is the poetry of Anne Sexton. I have attempted to illustrate that when the poems of Sexton are juxtaposed with many of the common themes of myths, Classical and Christian, it becomes apparent that she is mythologizing herself. To prove my thesis I utilized the works of Northrop Frye as well as Mircea Eliade, Jessie Weston, and Robert Graves who expound on concepts of rituals, cults, and the mythological roots of literature. I also researched Classical and Christian mythologies so to be able to juxtapose them with Sexton's poetry. In addition to thoroughly studying the poetry of Sexton (most specifically, Live or Die) I also read biographies and essays on her, and examined all available journals and collections of letters. A poet's personal memoirs often expose sources and inspirations for their poetry, allowing the critic to trace the poetry to a previously published piece of literature or well-chronicled myth. Finally, by reading the aforementioned resources I deduced the influences of Sexton's poetry, and purveyed them as well. In conclusion, this project has confirmed there is nothing original about confessional poetry; especially considering the familiar themes such as death, rebirth, and resurrection, and the universal controlling forces of many of the poems such as the moon, sun, God, etc. Sexton's poetry is not ""confessional"" at all other than that it reveals an intrinsic reliance on the past and myths to tell of a quest relative to that of many Biblical characters, including Christ."

An accurate method for assessing EE in the field could greatly influence the scope of future studies of free-living activities. Thirteen subjects (8 male, 5 female) completed a 2303 m course of varying grades at slow and fast self-selected paces. Data from a portable metabolic unit was used to compare the GPS-predicted EE (EEGPS). Calculations of EEGPS were made by compiling an equation accounting for ground speed, grade, (Minetti, et al., 2002) and wind resistance (Pugh, 1970). Differences between EEACT and EEGPS were statistically and practically significant for the slow walking trials. Fast trials showed no significant differences. The combined data differed significantly from EEACT, but was similar to the error for accelerometer-based activity monitors. The wrist and hip-worn GPS monitors provided similar results for EEGPS throughout the data set. Separating the data by grade type showed that EEGPS was most problematic for uphill walking. Additional analysis performed on the data showed no meaningful changes in the results. These analysis included increasing the sampling interval for the GPS monitors and implementing rudimentary smoothing techniques in an effort to reduce the error in the GPS-reported elevation data. The GPS monitor data were able to estimate EEACT for fast walking and the combined data within the error range consistently reported for activity monitors (Â±5 - 25%). The EEGPS for the slow walking trials could not reasonably predict actual EE. Despite the troubles with predicting EEACT, the two GPS monitors tested provided very similar estimates of EE when compared to each other, ruling out reliability as a potential source of error. The addition of wind resistance to the EEGPS equation accounted for less than 2% of the differences between actual and GPS-predicted EE. Sources of error include the accuracy of GPS technology, and the suitability of the equation for calculating EE based on speed and grade. Future studies should focus on the use of other GPS monitors, or creating a custom algorithm for estimating EE for walking.	['science', 'physiology', 'biology', 'life sciences']

Overweight and obese individuals lose the ability to control inflammation as percent body fat increases, likely linked to inefficient carbohydrate oxidation that amplifies inflammation. Little is known about how the quality of carbohydrates influences inflammation of muscle in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in inflammation and glucose metabolism between low glycemic index (LGI) and high glycemic index (HGI) diets following downhill running in overweight and obese women. This study was a pre-post design in which overweight and obese women (n = 20) were placed in matched pairs for percentage body fat, each receiving an isomacronutrient LGI or HGI diet. Participants completed a downhill run at heart rates at 65% predicted maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max) until 15% loss of isometric force of the hip and knee extensors, or volition fatigue, was achieved. Participants ate their prescribed diet for 24 h post exercise. Glucose, insulin, creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 were measured pre-exercise, 0, 24, and 48 h post-exercise. Isometric force and muscle tenderness were measured when blood was collected. Serum CK changed significantly over time (p < 0.001), with the peak at 24 h in the HGI group, and at 48 h in the LGI group. Isometric force decreased most at 24 h for the HGI group, and at 48 h for the LGI group, with significant differences occurring over time (p = 0.01), and a significant time/diet interaction (p = 0.02). No significant changes were seen in any of the inflammatory variables for diet or time, with the exception of the expected increase in IL-6 immediately post-exercise. There was a significant (p = 0.035) difference in delta insulin between groups. Delta IR also changed significantly over time between groups (p = 0.044). We conclude that while inflammation was not different between groups, a LGI diet following downhill running results in an acute improvement in insulin and IR in overweight and obese women.

The subsequent hundred years has seen a major increase in population within these areas accompanied by an economic shift away from maritime trade. Older ports have been abandoned, leaving behind antiquated urban infrastructure. The subsequent dismantling of these vast waterfront industrial areas has provided an opportunity for the reconfiguration of these spaces and the implementation of new urban and landscape strategies. Through a recycling of the existing fabric and introduction of new uses, many cities have revitalized their industrial wastelands and integrated these areas within the existing urban fabric. Other coastal cities have merely overlooked these neglected districts and focused development in their periphery, transforming these former economic focal point into physical and typological barriers.

At the Jonah natural gas field, Wyoming, use of an oak mat drilling platform placed atop the intact landscape was evaluated to facilitate drilling while minimizing disturbances to soil and plant resources. Concerns inherent to both techniques include adverse, long-term impacts to vegetation communities, soil compaction and soil physical and chemical characteristics. The percent change (%Î) in grass density at oak mat removal areas (OMRA) (+37 %) was significantly greater than at cut-and-fill locations reclaimed pre-2005 (RCAF<05) (+16 %). Forb density %Î at OMRA (+24 %) was significantly higher than at RCAF<05 locations (-86 %). At RCAF<05 locations 99 % of forb density was contributed by weedy forb species. This indicates that OMRA were more successful in promoting high grass density, maintaining forb populations and minimizing weedy forb components than RCAF<05 locations. RCAF<05 locations indicate an -84 %Î in shrub density whereas OMRA indicate a -33 %Î. Wyoming big sagebrush seedling density was highest at OMRA indicating that shrub density had a greater potential to recover there relative to RCAF<05 locations. Mean soil bulk density (Ïb) at OMRA had -3.0, +1.8 and +3.9 %Î in depth increments between 0-30.5 cm. The mean Ïb at cut-and-fill locations reclaimed in 2005 or later (RCAF > or equal to 05) had +7.0, +10.9 and +11.7 %Î in different depth increments between 0-45.7 cm. Using a Ïb range of 1.45-1.70 g/cm 3 as an indicator of potential plant growth problems, Ïb exceeding 1.45 g/cm 3 occured infrequently at OMRA compared to RCAF > or equal to 05 locations. RCAF > or equal to 05 locations had significant increases in %Î soil saturated-paste extract ECe (+209 %), CaCO 3 percentage (+48 %) and sand percentage (+16 %) compared to OMRA, presumably due to mixing of soil horizons. It is counterintuitive to expect that oak mats should alter physicochemical soil properties. Although limited to construction on slopes < or equal to 3 %, measured vegetation and soil characteristics indicated that the reclamation success of oak mat drill pads was greater than that obtained at reclaimed cut-and-fill locations.

However, the mechanism by which local oxygen tension utilizes nitric oxide signaling in order to regulate blood flow remains a major unanswered question in biology. Hemoglobin in red blood cells appears to be an ideal sensor, but lack of knowledge about hemoglobin's chemistry with nitric oxide creates a problem for understanding how hemoglobin induces vasodilation. A central focus of this work was to illuminate complexity and response of nitric oxide interactions with hemoglobin while showing how S-nitrosohemoglobin plays a pivotal role in this response. Electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were employed to observe reactions of low-spin methemoglobin species with nitric oxide. Models were developed and tested to establish the chemistry involved and the global hierarchy of reactions. De minimis models for all experiments are reported. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra confirmed the formation of low-spin iron species that, upon the addition of nitric oxide, showed a decrease in low-spin methemoglobin species and the formation of nitrosyl hemoblobin with a beta-subunit preference. We report the yield of S-nitrosohemoglobin production in reactions of nitric oxide with various methemoglobins distinguished by axial ligand and iron spin state.

The poor management of this disease process has dire effects on the morbidity and mortality of this population. It is imperative to identify the challenges that this group of people face with the self-management of Type II Diabetes. The conceptual framework for this study was based on Dorothea Orem's health deviation of self-care requisites. These health deviations result from the disease state and are used for diagnosis and treatment (Orem, 1985). The literature review and the discussion of results with the relevant literature were organized according to Orem's six themes of health deviations in the self-management. A qualitative research method, involving open-ended interviews with five Native American participants, was used. The participants were asked questions regarding their diagnosis, challenges in self-management, knowledge of long term effects, and additional needed resources. The data were analyzed using Luborsky's (1994), method of thematic analysis to identify the challenges Native American adults encounter in the self-management of Type II Diabetes, resulting in 8 topics. These included: a) feelings about Type II Diabetes diagnosis and the implications for lifestyle changes, b) prior experiences with family who have Type II Diabetes, c) challenges and lifestyle changes in managing Type II Diabetes, d) personal contributing factors to poor management, e) support systems for managing Type II Diabetes, f) identification of good management of Type II Diabetes, g) knowledge of long term effects of Type II Diabetes, h) additional support and resources needed to manage Type II Diabetes. Diabetes is a complex disease process that requires ongoing education and consistent medical care. It is essential that health care providers evaluate and tailor their care to the challenges of their patient population to improve the health status of those with Type II Diabetes.

Since standard computers are deterministic by nature, it is beneficial to understand how to convert nondeterministic finite state automata into equivalent deterministic versions. This conversion process is often inadequately presented in traditional textbooks, though, as static presentations rarely capture the dynamics of the process. This thesis provides a Java applet that will help students better understand the conversion, and may help teachers to better present the conversion. This applet was designed to be beneficial to student learning; therefore, many different learning modes were included. These modes vary the speed and level of detail of the conversion so that students may proceed at their own pace. Each step of the conversion is animated and the student is constantly made aware of what has just happened and what is going to happen next, along with how the step will be performed. If the student is asked by the applet to supply anything, the applet will provide the student with feedback on his or her mistakes or successes. This non-deterministic finite state automaton to deterministic finite state automaton conversion applet will be added to the Webworks hypertextbook project. This project is designed around the premise that animating algorithms will lead to better learning.

These predispositions are becoming more commonplace in middle and high school classrooms for various reasons. The NSF has identified a decline in students pursuing post-secondary careers in science and engineering, predominantly due to the negative perceptions seen in high school science classes. This study focused on the implementation of project based learning as a method for changing students' perspectives toward science and possibly altering their post-secondary choices towards a science career. Projects involved the shadowing of college researchers and professors in field-based environmental activities. High school students worked alongside college researchers and professors, while collecting data and preparing documentation in an inquiry based setting.

Whether in nature or a human related system, such as an educational system, a relatively small change in a variable can create a chaotic state demanding the need for further, deeper change. In this era of accountability in the public school sector, there is evidence of transformational leadership by some superintendents who embrace the idea of a clear and focused mission, distributed leadership, and fostering change through data-based decision making resulting in improved student achievement. This phenomenological study reviewed research on chaos theory and transformational leadership, gathered data from 11 superintendents, and through interviews and artifact examination discovered five emergent themes in whose districts there was significant growth in student achievement. Superintendents who embrace such actions are shifting from being systems managers to systems change agents. Instructional leadership, once left to teachers, principals, and specialists, is now a role the effective superintendent embraces.

Among those materials with potential advanced mechanical properties are fiber-reinforced composite laminates that utilize nanoscale fiber diameters. Through a combination of studying classic micromechanical models and modern computer-aided finite element analysis (FEA), the advantages for utilizing these nanofibers in advanced structural applications, such as space mirror backings, was investigated. The approach for modeling these composite structures was that of a Representative Volume Element (RVE). Using the program ABAQUS/CAE, a RVE was created with the goals of accurately comparing to the shear lag theory, effectively incorporating ""interphase"" zones that bond the constituents, and demonstrating effects of down-scaling fiber diameter. In this thesis, the progression of the ABAQUS model is thoroughly covered as it developed into a verified model correlating with the shear lag theory. The model produced was capable of utilizing interphase if desired, and was capable of off-axis loading scenarios. A MathCAD program was written in order to employ the published theoretical techniques, which were then compared to the FEA results for verification. The FEA model was found to work well in conjunction with the theory explored using MathCAD, after which the nanofiber FEA model showed some clear advantages over a conventional-sized model, specifically an increase in strength of the composite RVE. Finally, it was determined that the interfacial bonding strength plays a large role in the structure of the interphase zone, and thus the overall strength of the composite."

These films fall short of their true potential when they neglect to present their subjects as complex, multidimensional human beings with fascinating stories, opinions, tragedies and comedies to share about their lives. As science filmmakers we should attempt to re-humanize the way science is portrayed on film by looking to examples like standpoint feminist theory, which advocates owning our particular, incomplete subjective-viewpoints, or 'standpoints' as a form of empowerment. Championed by scientist and feminist scholar Donna Haraway, these partial perspectives allow filmmakers to create a place where the public and private lives of scientists can not only co-exist, but also strengthen one another. By exploring the complex world in the private lives of scientists, we can give greater respect to scientists themselves as well as to the intelligence and emotional needs of the greater public. To treat science and the people involved in its construction with more ethical responsibility, to build a more empowered and enlightened public, we as filmmakers need to introduce the personal values of willing scientists into the public sphere. If we can reinvent the science film as an endeavor steeped in humanity, it may become a more ethical and effective communication tool to fill these growing needs.

While archaeology is inherently interesting, it is an underused vehicle for teaching to national standards, especially science inquiry, in pre-collegiate education. This case study examined students' conceptual understanding of five science inquiry concepts (observation, inference, classification, context, and evidence) and the Nature of Science (NOS), the differences between science and history, and the similarities in science inquiry and historical inquiry through the study of archaeology. This qualitative case study included 27 subjects, all fifth grade students who were studying American history through archaeological inquiry. Data was collected through a series of learning assessment probes and a performance task designed specifically for this study. Interviews, observation of the performance task, and examination of classroom work completed data collection. With only minor exceptions, students were conversant in all five of the inquiry concepts, however, their understanding of each concept was highly individual. In many cases, students retained some misconceptions, misunderstandings, or incomplete understandings of the concepts. Identification of the cognitive processes underlying student understanding helped trace the origin of misconceptions, misunderstandings, and incomplete understandings. All of the students demonstrated some understanding of the Nature of Science and the relationships between science, history, and archaeology. The study has implications for learning, for curriculum development, and for teaching and teacher preparation. Students can easily retain misconceptions throughout a course of study or can fail to reach complete conceptual understanding. Identification of misconceptions and their source can provide teachers with a clear starting point to dispel misconceptions and to create deeper and more accurate conceptual understanding of science processes. Results can be used immediately to improve the curriculum used in this study and to design better science inquiry curricula. Future research could be designed to confirm the results of this study and to expand the sample to a larger and more diverse group of subjects.

Techniques like marker assisted selection and the candidate gene approach can benefit greatly by identifying conserved synteny and genes located within those regions. Both Pisum and Phaseolus have detailed linkage maps, but a limited number of markers have been located in both species. In the present study I mapped 21 genes in Phaseolus vulgaris, 16 of which had already been located on the Lens and Pisum sativum linkage maps, the markers were used to look for conserved synteny between Pisum, Lens and Phaseolus. In particular, I was able to target marker/gene-rich regions of pea linkage groups V and VII, as well as pea linkage group III, with Pisum STS markers and universally designed gene-specific markers already located on the pea linkage map. About 50% of the tested genes amplified an appropriate sized fragment in Phaseolus, but less than 40 % of the gene-specific markers showed polymorphism by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) analysis in bean. The data reveals little evidence for extensive gene order conservation, and even some closely linked (<5cM) loci in Pisum are not linked in Phaseolus vulgaris. The only example of conserved synteny was approximately 15cM on pea and lentil linkage group V and bean linkage group 1. Paal, Enolase, and TufM were first identified in the syntenic area and allowed identification of fin/det, one of several TFL genes already mapped in bean, as another orthologous loci between pea and bean. Finding conservation of synteny with Paal, identified Paal3 and TFL1 genes as linked loci in Arabidopsis thaliana on linkage group 5. The pea locus Paal1,2 is then speculated to be a tandem duplication of a Paal3 homolog in a ancient common ancestor and probably occurring after the speciation of Pisum.

Moats are fed by glacial streams and interact with comparatively large volumes of ice-covered lake water. This study investigated stream influence on moat chemistry and microbial biomass, productivity and diversity in the moat of East Lake Bonney (ELB) and compared the moat to the ice-covered portion of ELB. Stream inflow was a source of dissolved ions, inorganic carbon (DIC) inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) to the moat. SRP was rapidly removed in the moat near the stream inflow. Melted ELB ice and biological uptake reduced concentrations of DIN and DIC, resulting in a negative relationship to the inflow. Stream nutrients were correlated with high chlorophyll a and bacterial biomass near the inflow, were positively correlated with bacterial diversity, and negatively correlated with phytoplankton diversity. Correlations between nutrient availability and microbial biomass suggest resource limitation with respect to DIN and SRP, and infer dependence of heterotrophic bacterioplankton on primary productivity.

The levels of inquiry ranged from completely student designed investigations, to completely book-driven lessons with little to no inquiry. The lessons and observations will focus on this primary question: 1. How does changing the levels of inquiry influence student achievement? 2. What is the effect of changing the levels of inquiry on student's attitudes towards science? 3. In what way does the use of a Scientific Investigation Matrix, which is used to aid in differentiating the levels of inquiry, improve the creation of inquiry based lessons?

Hybridization and introgression may lead to a loss of locally adapted gene complexes and ecological adaptations in native populations, yet these potential consequences have not been fully evaluated in nature. I investigated factors influencing the spread of hybridization between native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) and nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in the upper Flathead River system, Montana (USA) and British Columbia (Canada). The fundamental questions of my dissertation were: what are the behavioral, ecological, and fitness consequences of hybridization and what factors influence successful invasion of hybrids? First, I assessed the patterns of spawning between parental species and their hybrids and found that hybridization alters the spawning behavior of migratory westslope cutthroat trout, and is spreading via long distance dispersal of hybrids from downstream sources and some temporal overlap during spawning. Second, I describe for the first time how a wide range of levels of nonnative admixture affect fitness of cutthroat trout in the wild by estimating reproductive success in a recently invaded stream using parentage analysis with multilocus microsatellite markers. Small amounts of hybridization markedly reduced reproductive success, with fitness exponentially declining by ~50% with 20% nonnative genetic admixture. Finally, I evaluated the association of local-habitat features, landscape characteristics, and biotic factors with the spread of hybridization in the system, and found that hybridization increases in streams with warmer water temperatures, high land use disturbance and close proximity to the source of hybridization; however, none of these factors appeared sufficient to prevent further spread. These combined results suggest that hybrids are not only genetically different than westslope cutthroat trout but also have reduced fitness and are ecologically different, and that hybridization is likely to continue to spread if hybrid populations with high amounts of rainbow trout admixture are not reduced or eliminated. I conclude that extant aboriginal cutthroat trout are at greater conservation risk due to hybridization than previously thought and policies that protect hybridized populations need reconsideration.

A large-scale effort was conducted in the past decade to sample Montana prairie stream fish assemblages. This effort focused on sampling as many streams as possible, mostly during summer. Longitudinal sampling within drainages and replication of sites across time was minimal. Consequently, the spatiotemporal variation of prairie stream fish assemblages in Montana is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the influence of spatial, temporal, and abiotic variables in structuring prairie stream fish assemblages and 2) determine the survey design that best characterizes prairie stream fish assemblages. To assess spatiotemporal variation, lower, middle, and upper sites were sampled on five tributaries of the Yellowstone River during each season over a two-year period. Spatial position explained the greatest amount of variation (18.5%), followed by proportion of fine substrates (13.9%). Season (i.e., temporal variation) was not significant in explaining the overall variation in the fish assemblage. Fish species were associated with lower, middle, and upper spatial positions and along the fine substrates gradient based on abundance by species. A more detailed spatial analysis of fish assemblage variation was conducted by sampling sites arrayed from the confluence to the headwaters on each of the five streams during June and July 2005 and 2006. Species richness varied longitudinally and decreased from downstream to upstream sites. Proportion of fine substrates increased and pool area decreased from downstream to upstream sites. Longitudinal changes in species richness were often associated with longitudinal changes in the proportion of fine substrates. Large river fishes were limited to lower and middle reaches and were only occasionally found in upper reaches. Spatiotemporal and longitudinal findings were consistent among streams of varying watershed sizes. At least lower, middle, and upper sites are required to adequately characterize the fish assemblages of prairie streams and more samples are needed at lower sites than middle or upper sites. Given logistic and monetary constraints, biologists should design their surveys to maximize spatial coverage to adequately characterize fish assemblages of prairie streams.

The base of core LRRL 06P49 consisted of inorganic silt and clay, deposited when a large glacial lake occupied the eastern Centennial Valley. The glacial lake receded during the late-glacial period when its western outlet stabilized. Prior to 17,000 cal yr BP, high pollen percentages of Juniperus, Poaceae, Asteraceae, and other herbs as well as low pollen accumulation rates suggest cold dry conditions. The sparsely vegetated landscape at LRRL is consistent with paleoclimate model simulations that show southward displacement of the jet stream and a strong glacial anticyclone during the full-glacial period. Between 17,000 and 10,500 cal yr BP, increases in Picea and Abies pollen percentages suggest a shift to subalpine parkland and warmer conditions than before as result of the northward shift of the jet stream and increasing summer insolation. From 10,500 to 7100 cal yr BP, pollen percentages of Picea and Abies decreased and those of xerophytic taxa (e.g., Chenopodiaceae and Pseudotsuga) increased, suggesting development of steppe and open forest. Warmer drier conditions in the early Holocene were likely a response to increased summer insolation and a strengthened Pacific subtropical high-pressure system. From 7100 to 2400 cal yr BP, cooler and moister conditions at LRRL, driven by decreasing summer insolation, led to the expansion of high-elevation conifers, steppe, and wetlands. Increases in Picea and Abies pollen percentages after 2400 cal yr BP indicate further closing of forests at high elevations and even cooler and wetter conditions than before. Examination of the first arrival of Pseudotsuga in pollen records throughout the region shows that its arrival was later at sites on the Atlantic side of the Continental Divide as compared to sites on the Pacific side. The geographic pattern suggests that the Continental Divide posed a topographic or climate barrier in the late-glacial period, delaying the migration of Pseudotsuga menziesii from glacial refugia.

Through interactions of the pump laser with the Raman active medium, all Raman systems can produce both red-shifted, Stokes, emission and blue-shifted, anti-Stokes, emission. Previous, continuous-wave Raman laser systems have focused on the Stokes emission. This dissertation presents theory and data on the anti-Stokes emission. Specifically, it investigates the anti-Stokes mode structure and the emitted power as a function of input pump power, detuning, pressure, and mode combination. In order to be able to compare theory to data, the existing semi-classical CW Raman laser theory is extended to include the possibility that the spatial mode of any of the three fields (pump, Stokes, or anti-Stokes) is not the fundamental spatial mode. Numerical simulations of this theory are used to understand the behavior of the CW Raman system. All the data is compared to the theory, with varying degrees of success. The pump laser used in this research is a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG at 532 nm and the Raman active medium is H 2. This combination results in Stokes and anti- Stokes wavelengths of 683 nm and 435 nm, respectively. Five methods were found in this research for increasing the amount of anti-Stokes emitted: increasing the input pump power, detuning from gain line-center of the Stokes emission, increasing the reflectivity of the cavity mirrors at the anti-Stokes wavelength, switching to a higher-order spatial mode, and decreasing the H 2 pressure within the Raman cavity. In general, it was found that the higher-order anti-Stokes modes did not agree with a single theoretical spatial mode. Superpositions were formed of multiple theoretical spatial modes giving intensity distribution across the profile similar to the measured profile. Three theoretical spatial mode symmetries were investigated: rectangular, cylindrical, and elliptical. Also measured was the Raman gain as a function of pressure. The accepted theory for the Raman linewidth was found to be slightly off.	['optics', 'physics', 'science', 'physical sciences']

This small, rural school is grappling with the recent loss of the community's largest employer, a large paper mill. Families who were once living quite comfortably are now struggling to survive. Most of the jobs lost were very skill specific, and those skills are not helping those displaced to find meaningful work that can support their families. This stress is played out every day in my fourth grade classroom. Montana's timber economy is shrinking. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, nine of the twenty jobs with the fastest projected growth are STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2010). Given better educational background and more flexible skills, the children in my classroom will be more prepared to handle such a catastrophic economic blow if it should strike in their adult life. Students with positive science experiences in their elementary through high school years are more likely to choose science related studies after graduation. The purpose of the study was to improve student achievement in science and student perception of their own abilities by implementing a structured and supportive program of communication between family and school. Using home visits to each child, a class website focusing on science related explorations, and frequent contact via e-mail, newsletters, phone calls, and one-on-one visits, I established a culture of communication. I found that this increased focus on keeping parents and children in close communication and contact with our school and classroom had a significant positive impact on student attitudes and academic performance in science. Hopefully this is one piece of what it takes to help them seek out a challenging future in higher education and beyond.

Public policy in Montana and through most of the United States dictates no rules about well water testing, only recommends testing be done on a yearly basis. Well water can contain lead, arsenic, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), synthetic organic compounds (SOCs), nitrates, and copper and many other possible contaminants. The choice of a consumer-based water filtration system should be based on the contaminant profile of the water source. Filter types vary in design and their contaminant removal profile, such as simple pitcher filters, activated carbon, and reverse osmosis, but many filtration systems can remove multiple contaminants and reduce the risk of exposures. The purpose of this project is to provide a list of potential contaminants and their health effects that have commonly been identified as contaminants in water samples in Gallatin County, Montana, as well as provide a comprehensive resource for consumers and health care providers to make decisions about well-water treatment.

We have landed a man on the moon, an unmanned rover on mars, and now have begun to explore the outer reaches of the galaxy looking for the origin of the known universe. When you think of the universe in general, architecture seems pretty insignificant, but it is an important element that keeps our society interconnected. ""Design manifests culture, and culture rests firmly on the foundations of what we believe to be true about the world."" (Van Der Ryn, Cowan, pg 9) Today architecture appears to be diverting in two directions: one is aiming towards an external image focused on aesthetics, with the space it creates internally and its resource consumption being secondary. While The other is focused on a more sustainable design, based on reducing resource consumption, but lacking attention to aesthetics and spacial quality. ""Even the most advanced advocates of ecological design are still struggling with ways to integrate environmental technology, resource conservation, and aesthetic content. Without all three components in place, there is little chance for a truly enduring architecture. A major factor contributing to the longevity of buildings that have survived from the past is their fusion of nature and art."" (Wines, pg.9) In society today it is evident the pressure humans put on nature to provide and protect. Considering this problem, I began to wonder how we, as human beings, could do this to the environment. Because, ""after all, whatever we do to nature comes back to us in the end.""(David Orr, Seminar 2003) This led me to consider the practice of sustainable architecture. Sustainable Design has been used in rural areas of undeveloped countries for decades, but has never become mainstream; In part, due to price increases and inconvenience. My thesis seeks to explore this balance, a balance between the built environment and the natural environment. To apply modern design and sustainable design to create a beautiful and environmentally friendly building. The resulting architecture will be enduring and serve to better the way of life for humans and the environment. My goal is to design architecture that is sustainable, spatial, experiential, and has an aesthetic quality, architecture that creates a statement as the only viable solution for a particular region. ""The best way to make real architecture is by letting a building evolve out of the culture and place."" (Samuel Mockbee, 107). I will be designing a structure in Telluride about 2 blocks from the town gondola. I feel this area will have impact on the surrounding community as far as public use and pedestrian interaction. I will design a sustainable education center on the site. It will use an abandoned building on the site to reinforce the reuse of materials an recycling of space. This exploration will concentrate on the compatibility of sustainable architecture and aesthetics in design, as well as a hands on educational tool."

Changes in the cloud microphysical structure due to the interaction of aerosols and water vapor can produce more reflective clouds, resulting in more incoming solar radiation being reflected back into space, leading to an overall negative radiative forcing. Water vapor also plays an important role in the atmospheric feedback process that acts to amplify the positive radiative forcing resulting from increasing levels of atmospheric CO2. In the troposphere, where the water vapor greenhouse effect is most important, the situation is harder to quantify. A need exists for tools that allow for high spatial resolution range resolved measurements of water vapor number density up to about 4 km. One approach to obtaining this data within the boundary layer is with the Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) that is being developed at Montana State University. A differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument for automated profiling of water vapor in the lower troposphere has been designed, tested, and is in routine operation. The laser transmitter for the DIAL instrument uses a widely tunable external cavity diode laser (ECDL) to injection seed two cascaded semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) to produce a laser transmitter that accesses the 824-841 nm spectral range. The DIAL receiver utilizes a 28-cm-diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, an avalanche photodiode (APD) detector, and a narrow band optical filter to collect, discriminate, and measure the scattered light. A technique of correcting for the wavelength-dependent incident angle upon the narrow band optical filter as a function of range has been developed to allow accurate water vapor profiles to be measured down to 225 m above the surface. Data comparisons using the DIAL instrument and co-located radiosonde measurements are presented demonstrating the capabilities of the DIAL instrument.

It adds to the current body of literature identifying professional learning communities as a recommended method to improve classroom practice and close achievement gaps in mathematics. Although much has been written about professional learning communities within a given school or district, there is little advice for those wishing to develop a professional learning community across schools. Teachers and administrators in the bounded system were committed to improving student learning in mathematics but struggled to do so within the context of high student mobility rates and a serious lack of consistent curricular material. The use of ALRR helped establish a spirit of trust among Math Inquiry Group [MIG] participants while responding to important contextual factors. The identified contextual factors were organized around three themes: organizational, family and community, and policy factors. Twenty-three mathematics teachers from grades 5-12 were interviewed about their participation in the professional learning community known as MIG over a threeyear period. The researcher's analysis of the interview transcripts indicates teacher participation in MIG addressed their professional, intellectual, emotional, and personal needs. Teachers also identified an increase in personal content and pedagogical knowledge of mathematics and an increased self-confidence in their ability to teach the content. These in turn influenced their classroom practice. Through the process, teachers began to change their sense of professional identity.	['auxiliary sciences of history', 'education', 'civilization']

Both the homeless population and the abandoned infrastructure of cities are seen as existent until their place in society has been tapered, suspended or given up on completely. Once the individual or building reaches a point of societal condemnation it is neglected and eventually forgotten, slipped into the archives of non-existence. What once was an element of a functioning whole becomes a void that is commonly overlooked. Many forgotten people within the homeless population and buildings within abandoned infrastructure have an immense amount of potential energy that may be utilized to further their existence as a function of society. At a human level the homeless person flows through the social construct with little more acknowledgement than a shrug of the shoulder and a minor donation. In the built environment resources sit stagnant amongst constantly advancing infrastructure. In both circumstances the subject is left to exist as a non-participating part of a society that does not acknowledge their presence and lacks the mutual interaction that makes the vagrant or abandoned infrastructure an integral part of the social system. The Re-Institute program identifies contributing factors of social exclusion at both human and infrastructural levels. These factors will be counteracted by reversing the primary concepts of social exclusion into a catalyst to solve the issue. The mechanisms used to combat the problems of social exclusion will exist in a sociological, environmental and programmatic realm within the Re-Institute project. Through the architectural and programmatic development of the program, these mechanisms will re-institute neglected resources back into a constructive part of society.

Dietary treatments were based on approximately 85% grass hay and 15% supplement. Supplements contained whole soybeans plus corn (102% MP) or dried distillers grains plus soybean meal (119% MP). After 35 d of intake measurement, heifers were placed into adjacent pens and fed their diets for an additional 50 or 82 d. Upon completion of the feeding trial, heifers were transported back to the ranch, managed as a single group, and production data were measured. Level of dietary MP had no effect (P > 0.17) on calf birthweight, adjusted 205-d weight, preweaning ADG, age at weaning, cow BW at calving, proportion of cows cycling at bull exposure, or proportion of cows to conceive. Dry matter intake per unit of BW 0.75 and RFI did not differ because of treatment and had no effect (P > 0.17) on any variables measured. In 2009, 24 of these heifers that had the highest and lowest RFI were selected to be fed a similar diet as in 2008 to determine the correlation of DMI per BW 0.75 and RFI between heifers (2008) and later as cows (2009). Cows were adapted to the diet for 10 d followed by a 70 d trial to determine individual feed intakes and weight gain. Dry matter intake per BW 0.75 was highly correlated (r = 0.71, P < 0.01) between first and second parities, as was residual feed intake (r = 0.83, P < 0.01). For 5 d, fecal samples were collected twice daily and indigestible ADF was used to estimate DM digestibility. Residual feed intake was negatively correlated with DM digestibility (r = -0.51, P = 0.03). Production traits from 2008 were analyzed to determine if cows found to be either high or low RFI in 2009 had similar levels of production. Low and high RFI cows did not differ (P > 0.45) in cow BW at calving, calf birthweight, calf ADG, 205-d weaning weight, or weaning age.

Traditional geotechnical engineering soil tests generally do not measure soil properties on a micro-scale; instead, macro scale properties are commonly used as estimates of microstructure properties in determining soil engineering behavior. Additionally, traditional geotechnical engineering soil tests are destructive in nature, and many test methods destroy the same soil properties they intend to measure. The goal of this research was to develop non-destructive soil test methods using x-ray computer-aided tomography (CT) scanning techniques to determine soil index properties. The CT scanning process provides a promising method for examining soil microstructure in a non-destructive manner. This research had two main objectives. The first was to configure the Montana State University Civil Engineering Department's computer-aided tomography scanner to perform CT scans on soil samples. The second objective was to use the CT scanner to develop nondestructive test procedures to determine geotechnical index properties of soils. Test methods were developed in this study to determine porosity, grain size distribution, and pore size distribution. The results from the first objective showed that the MSU CT scanning equipment is capable of producing high quality CT scans of soil materials. Resolution limitations of the scanner define the smallest soil grain size that is detectable in a CT scan, but the scan resolution may be improved by using smaller sample sizes for small particle soils. The results of the second portion of the study show that the non-destructive CT scanning test methods compare favorably with traditional geotechnical laboratory mechanical test methods. CT-measured porosity values and grain size distributions compared well with mechanical testing results, which were used to validate the new test methods. In addition, the CT-measured pore size distributions were in good agreement with an accepted pore size mathematical model. Since traditional pore size distribution tests are time-consuming, labor intensive, and destructive in nature, the non-destructive x-ray CT scanning test methods developed in this study show strong promise as a means for measuring an elusive soil property that cannot be accurately measured using traditional geotechnical testing procedures.

Mathematics content courses, aimed at helping pre-service elementary teachers become more competent and confident in their knowledge of the mathematics they will teach, often provide inadequate time for practice and demonstration of mathematics knowledge and skills. As a response to this issue, this study examined how implementation of assessments based on a ""Rule of Four"" might increase the mathematics content knowledge of pre-service elementary teachers. The ""Rule of Four"" performance tasks used in the study required the students to demonstrate their understanding of mathematics concepts relating to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of whole numbers, integers, and fractions. Three of the four performance tasks devised for each concept aligned with the following developmental levels advocated by Jerome Bruner: enactive (use of manipulatives), iconic (drawing a picture or diagram), and symbolic (writing the concept in words). The fourth performance task required demonstration of an application or real world representation of the mathematical concept. A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a control group taught and assessed using traditional methods and a treatment group taught traditionally and assessed using the ""Rule of Four"" performance assessments along with other traditional assessment tools. Pretests and posttests were given to both groups to determine whether there was a difference in the two groups' mathematics achievement and when gender, age, or class (e.g., freshman, sophomore) was factored in. Because the control and treatment groups were significantly different in their pretest scores (with the control group having higher scores), an analysis of covariance was used for data analysis. Results showed that there were no significant differences between the groups on their posttest scores, including when gender, age, or class was factored in. The study's results indicate that assessment by ""Rule of Four"" did not produce higher levels of mathematics achievement than instruction using traditional assessment methods. While there was no difference in performance on the posttest by the two groups, the treatment group made substantial gains from their pretest scores."

Forage DMI was estimated using IVDMD and chromic oxide as an external marker for estimating fecal output. Forage wastage was estimated by sampling and weighing the initial swath, standing, and baled forage, and weighing the forage again after a 7-d collection period, and subtracting the estimated forage DMI. Samples of baled, swathed, and any standing forage were collected in August and October and analyzed for DM, OM, CP, NDF, ADF, and in situ dry matter digestibility (ISDMD). There was no treatment by year interaction (P = 0.56) for BW change and no difference (P = 0.33) between treatments. There was a treatment by year interaction (P = 0.04) for DMI. In 2010, DMI was greater (P = 0.06) by CONFINEMENT ewes compared to GRAZE ewes (2.4 vs 1.7 kg x ewe -Â¹ x d -Â¹); however, in 2011, DMI did not differ (P = 0.25) between treatments. There was no treatment by year interaction (P > 0.22) for forage wastage either as a percent of beginning available forage or as kilograms of wastage. Although percentage wastage did not differ between treatments (P = 0.23), kilograms of wastage was greater (P = 0.03) for GRAZE than CONFINEMENT. For both years in the swathed forage, ISDMD and OM decreased while NDF and ADF increased. In 2010 CP increased, but in 2011 it remained the same. For both years in the baled forage, CP decreased while ISDMD and NDF increased. In 2010, ADF decreased and OM increased, but in 2011 ADF increased and OM decreased. Although nutrient content was lower in the swath, wastage and animal performance did not differ between the treatments. This research provides a sound biological basis for an economic assessment of using swath grazing in commercial sheep operations.

However, local and systemic infections are frequently associated with the use of medical devices and implants. In fact, implanted devices often provide a highly suitable surface for bacterial adhesion and colonization resulting in the formation of complex, differentiated and structured communities known as biofilms. Once a biofilm infection is established, conventional treatments frequently fail as bacteria in the form of biofilms are much more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. A variety of implantable drug-delivery systems have been developed to combat biofilm related infections. The main goal of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of a drugdelivery method using polymer hydrogels. The University of Washington Engineered Biomaterials (UWEB) group has developed a novel drug-delivery polymer matrix consisting of a poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogel coated with ordered methylene chains forming an ultrasound-responsive coating. The polymer hydrogel was loaded with ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic well known for its action against gram-negative bacteria. This system was able to retain the drug inside the polymer in the absence of ultrasound but showed a significant drug release when low intensity ultrasound was applied. A consistent experimental program has been developed to determine the effectiveness of the UWEB hydrogels against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Biofilms were grown on hydrogel surfaces in flowcells. Ultrasound was applied for twenty minutes every twenty four hours for three days using a 43 kHz ultrasonic bath. Confocal images were taken both before and after ultrasound application. The confocal data was then analyzed quantitatively using the biofilm analysis software package, COMSTAT. In addition, a numerical model was developed to demonstrate and characterize drug-delivery from hydrogel surfaces. Experimental results showed that biofilm accumulation on ciprofloxacin loaded hydrogels with ultrasound induced drug-delivery was significantly reduced compared to biofilms grown in control experiments. The results of these studies may ultimately facilitate future development of medical devices sensitive to external ultrasonic impulses, capable of treating or preventing biofilm growth via ""on demand"" drug release."

Experiments 1 and 2 were randomized complete block designs, with 24 wethers were maintained in individual metabolism crates and assigned to four treatments (6 wethers/treatment). Experiment 1 compared tetany risk ratios (TRR) of 1.6, 2.3, 2.9, or 3.5. Dry matter, NDF, and N digestibilities were not different between treatments. Nitrogen retention decreased (P < 0.05) as the tetany risk ratio increased. No treatment differences were recorded in Mg, Ca, K, or P balance. The TRR 2.3 treatment had the greatest decrease (P < 0.05) in serum Mg after 15d. Experiment 2 compared tetany risk ratios of 1.5, 2.6, 1.5 plus MgO, or 1.5 plus MgCl. The TRR 2.6 treatment showed increased (P < 0.05) DM, NDF, and N digestibilities when compared to all other treatments. Nitrogen digestibility decreased (P < 0.05) with the addition of supplemental Mg. No treatment differences in Mg, Ca, K, or P balance were recorded. The TRR 2.6 treatment had the greatest decrease (P < 0.05) in serum Mg after 5 d. Experiment 3 was a cafeteria study using a switchback design, 23 Angus heifers were weighed and randomly assigned to one of two locations (11 heifers in drylot, and 12 heifers on pasture) containing two mineral supplements (0.0% Mg and 10.0% Mg). The groups were rotated between locations after 15 d for 30 d of measurements. Individual mineral consumption (grams/d), feeder attendance (trips/d), and feeding duration (seconds/d) were measured using a GrowSafeÂ® individual feeding system. Heifers consumed 119% more (P < 0.01) 0.0% Mg supplement each day than the 10.0% Mg. Heifers made almost twice as many (P < 0.01) trips to the feeder, and spent an additional 91.3 s consuming the 0.0% Mg than the 10.0% Mg. Total mineral intakes were 87.3 % greater (P < 0.01) when supplemented on pasture compared to drylot. During the first 15 d, total mineral intakes were higher (P < 0.01) than for the second 15 d.

During this turn-taking phase, the confederate interjected 0%, 33%, 66%, or 100% false items. We termed this increasing proportion of false information suggested by the confederate item-based credibility, and manipulated it between participants. Experiment 2 added a novel manipulation of partner credibility, or the perceived memorial ability of the confederate. In general, participants who heard false items from the confederate were significantly more likely to write these items down on a later recall task, and were more likely to recognize these items as having occurred in the original slides, than participants who heard no false items. This was especially true for more typical (high-expectancy items). Interestingly, we did not obtain a significant decrease in contagion when participants encountered higher proportions of false information (Experiment 1), even when they were made aware of the confederates' ""very poor"" memory abilities (Experiment 2). It seems that our novel item and person-based credibility manipulations were not enough to reduce the contagion effect to any significant degree. Participants did not deduce or infer credibility based on content accuracy or memory performance on a related task, demonstrating just how susceptible our memories are to misinformation. The methods introduced here capture and extend the core phenomena of the social contagion effect, while simultaneously unveiling the robust nature of this paradigm."

Adding a catalyst to a reaction, while increasing the rate, complicates purification because the catalyst must be separated from the product(s) of the reaction. If the catalyst is a drastically different size than the product then seperation can be achieved as easily as filtering over a membrane. Dendrimers are becoming popular scaffolding for tethering catalysts. Attaching a catalyst to a dendrimer makes a bigger catalytic unit that is easily separated from reaction product(s) of similar size to the untethered catalyst. However, attaching a catalyst to a dendritic framework usually results in a decrease in the catalystÎ±s activity. Previous work reported that attaching three salicylic acid residues in close proximity to each other on a linear PPI polymer catalyzed the hydrolysis of the protein immunoglobulin GÎ±s peptide backbone. Attaching three salicylic acid residues at random locations on the polymer showed significantly less catalytic activity. Salicylic acid functionalized generations 1-5 PPI dendrimers were synthesized and characterized. Rate enhancement of IgG hydrolysis by the functionalized dendrimers was studied with SDS-PAGE. Generation 5 salicylic acid functionalized PPI dendrimers catalyzed the hydrolysis of IgG while lower generations and 5-nitrosalicylic acid did not. Generation 5 salicylic acid functionalized dendrimers catalyzing IgG hydrolysis is another in a small number of examples of catalytic systems enhanced by dendritic scaffolding.

The combination of documented low health literacy levels in U.S. and the proliferating use of CAM throughout the country create the potential for poor healthcare outcomes. Previous research indicates that due to lack of access to healthcare, rural residents often utilize CAM. Quantitative research methods and Margaret Newman's Health as an Expanding Consciousness provided the underlying framework for this study. A systematic sampling of 92 residents of Flathead County participated in the study. The data were collected by use of a mail survey which included a ten item CAM health literacy quiz and was analyzed using the SPSS 15 version statistical software program. The results indicated that almost half of the participants used CAM providers and more than half used self directed CAM. Musculoskeletal pain was the most frequently reported health problem for utilizing CAM. Health care providers, written materials, and the internet were reported most frequently as the resources used to obtain information about health problems and CAM. Greater than half of the participants were rated as Average for their CAM health literacy score and no significant relationships were found between selected sociodemographic factors and CAM health literacy levels. The implications of the study for nursing research include a) a need for continued research regarding CAM health literacy, b) establishing a valid and reliable tool to measure health literacy levels about CAM, and c) continued research to identify and trend what resources patients are using to obtain their information about health problems and CAM. The implications of the study for nursing practice include a) the healthcare provider evaluating their own CAM health literacy level and being knowledgeable about where to obtain evidence based practice information about CAM, b) a self assessment about the healthcare provider's feelings about CAM and how they present information or educate their patient's about CAM, and c) providing patients with appropriate education materials about CAM and directing patients to reputable resources about CAM.

This corpus is represented by works such as: A Long Way Gone, What is the What, War Child, Beasts of No Nation, and They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky. Such works market the memories of violent childhood as an empathy-creating nexus for Western audiences. Despite the humanitarian appeal, the aesthetic architecture of AATN creates serious problems for ethical readership. The virtuality created by these texts (to varying degrees) has the effect of transporting the reader's consciousness into the ""presently happening"" mind of the narrator. The result of this intimate spectatorship is that readers' ethical discriminations are lessened because of the close proximity to scenes of violence. Such frames of reading are argued to create false empathy, numbness, and complicity to violence. If this subgenre inherently creates problems for ethical reading, an outside ostension of ethical paradigms is needed. My thesis argues that recovery from the problem of presence in AATN can only derive from ethical-literary recognitions of absence. The works of Primo Levi and Theodor Adorno argue for aesthetic representations that recognize ethical absence and distance. Such Holocaust critics deny narrative testimony's inherent right to frame events through abject or sublime expressions. Holocaust critics set important ethical demands for AATN's presentation of aesthetic excess. Secondly, my thesis asserts that deconstructive ethical criticism shares similar ethical aims to Holocaust values of absence. Levinas' concept of alterity, and Derrida's deconstructive mourning each create a deeply motivated ethical value of absence. These frames of reading otherness may deny readers the ability to create unethical empathies and equivocations. My thesis confirms that Holocaust and deconstructive ethical lenses are structured in such a way that they create a double-demand to otherness. The aporia created by this double-demand makes for the most ethical recognition of absences in traumatic narrative. The scope of my argument suggests that meaningful relationships to the past can alter the way that ""presence"" is responded to in reading."

In response to the higher price of milk, dairy producers have increased the total amount of milk they supply. Investigation of these responses and the factors causing them provides information about the impacts and effectiveness of the U.S. dairy regulations. This study examines two aspects of dairy producers' responses to the dairy regulations. These are: (1) What is the relationship between profit incentives created by the dairy program and farmers' decisions to improve the productivity of dairy herds through herd quality testing activities? and (2) Have the short run profits created by the dairy regulations been capitalized into the market prices of replacement dairy cattle? The results of the investigation suggest that there is no significant relationship between dairy profitability, as defined in the research, and the level of participation in Dairy Herd Improvement Association testing of dairy cattle. Further, the profitability created by the dairy program appears to be completely capitalized into the prices of dairy cattle implying that, in the long run, economic profits to dairy producers are zero. Consequently, the dairy regulations appear to have little impact on the adoption of herd improvement activities. However, the U.S. Government efforts to achieve the goals of the regulations are largely frustrated by the competitive nature of the production sector in the U.S. dairy industry.

This project focused on evaluating the impact the Bridges to Science outreach program had on students' understanding of science concepts. Students' level of understanding, attitude and motivation, and thoughts about science careers were considered as well. This project also investigated the impact on classroom teachers' professionalism, on the program staffs' pedagogy, and on my own professionalism and involvement with the program. The Bridges to Science program offered by the University of Lethbridge targets urban high school students in biology, chemistry, and physics, and attempts to increase their interest in science by providing engaging lab activities implemented by graduate students. Students' understanding of science concepts was assessed by comparing nontreatment lab activities conducted by classroom teachers to treatment lab activities conducted by the outreach volunteers. Pre and postassessment data for nontreatment and treatment units were collected using concept questions, interviews with concept maps, and teacher observations. Other forms of data collection such as surveys, journals and personal observations were used to assess students' level of understanding, attitude and motivation, knowledge about career options, teachers' professionalism, volunteers' pedagogy, and my own professionalism and involvement with the outreach program. The results indicated a greater increase in students' understanding and level of understanding through the implementation of the program compared with classroom activities. Not only did students' motivation and attitude improve, but their knowledge of career options increased as well. Pedagogical improvement occurred with volunteers, but there was little impact on teachers' sense of professionalism.

AD patient brains acquire hallmark protein aggregates, referred to as senile A beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), that coincide with brain cell loss and dementia. A subset of AD patients carry mutant genes. Our understanding of AD largely relies on model systems that express these gene variants. Mice engineered to express AD-mutant human genes develop A beta plaques, but fail to develop the tau-containing NFTs or cell loss. Mutant tau variants are required to induce NFTs and neuronal loss in mice, but AD patients carry normal tau genes. The inability of mouse tau to become a pathogenic protein in the presence of AD-mutant gene variants, and the general insufficiency of the current systems to recapitulate AD, inspired the research described here. To determine if species differences between mouse and human tau inhibit the progression of AD in mice, I utilized a well-characterized mouse model of a related disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD mice carry mutant human tau and develop NFTs and cell loss. I ablated mouse tau in FTD mice and looked for signs of more severe pathology. I compared the FTD mice, with and without mouse tau, to FTD mice with and without wild type human tau to investigate potential tau species-specific differences. My studies indicated that wild type tau, mouse or human, dampened the pathological effects of FTD tau implying a general, not mouse-specific, effect of normal tau protein. Our data suggest that unknown factors, distinct from endogenous mouse tau, contribute to the inability of mice to model AD. The recent interest in patient-specific stem cell (SC) models to study disease necessitates a thorough evaluation of their ability to recapitulate key characteristics of disease, reproducibility, and longevity. I generated and characterized brain SC cultures from FTD fetal mice and compared them to those generated from mice with normal human tau. Significant genotype associated differences were discovered in the SC system and later verified in adult mice to reinforce the potential of patient-specific SC models to study disease.

The government relocated visitor services away from the rims of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone to a new development, inaugurating the National Park Service's Mission 66 redevelopment program. Replacing the 70-year-old, ""organically grown,"" rustic settlement was a Modern, preconceived village resembling 1950s suburbia. This study examines how different generations of Yellowstone visitors have experienced two dramatically disparate and contested versions of Canyon as a park place. The old Canyon settlement was established incrementally and grew organically. It was tied to a geographic point and its pattern evolved through time. Unfortunately, the settlement was built quite close to the canyon's rim. When developments at Canyon were initiated in the 1880s, national parks represented a new responsibility for the federal government-a new type of land use. Entrepreneurial interests and visitor expectations challenged the government's ability to regulate visitor place creation. By the mid-1930s, federal park planning strategies matured and government control strengthened. Planners recognized the undesirable location of Canyon's visitor settlement. The government persuaded park concessioners to move the tourist settlement away from the canyon, motivated in part by the nation's developing preservation ethic. The Mission 66 initiative also encouraged a dramatic reworking of the Canyon area, producing much of the cultural landscape visible today. The formation and evolution of that landscape illustrates the evolving political strength and maturation of federal government stewardship in national parks."	['landscape architecture']

Educating nursing students is expensive, and when students do not persist in a nursing program, valuable resources are taken from other students who may be successful. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to discover and understand the program and personal factors that current students, graduates, and previous nonpersistent students reported as helping students in the associate of science in nursing program at Montana State University-Northern persist to graduation. The study also explored program and personal factors that current students, graduates, and previous nonpersistent students reported as contributing to leaving the associate of science in nursing program. A questionnaire was developed by the researcher using concepts from the literature review. For the quantitative portion of this mixed methods study, 114 questionnaires were returned from the population of 191 students who were admitted into the program in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Responses to this questionnaire are presented in percentages of responses for each participant type. Twenty-four participants were interviewed for the qualitative portion of this study. Those interviewed consisted of 8 current students, 8 graduates, and 8 previous nonpersistent students. Findings consisted of 21 themes. The major themes were that program factors of relationships between faculty and students, support of peers, and specific factors of the curriculum were perceived as resulting in success in the program. Personal factors that students perceived as helping them be successful include determination and commitment to the goal of being a nurse, support from family members, realization of how hard the program is, and positive self-esteem. Recommendations include developing strategies to promote faculty-student contact, encouraging student contact with other students to develop peer support, making specific curriculum changes, investigating financial resources so that students do not have to work so many hours while in the program, increasing prerequisites to the nursing program, and providing students with assistance in test-taking strategies, study skills, and stress management.

Although media scholars have proposed working definitions for these terms, their application for documentary storytelling is still scarce. Using the foundations offered by Henry Jenkins and Martin Lister and collaborators, I examine the consequences that new media and transmedia may have for documentary storytellers that are using them as production and distribution tools. This work is the result of a personal desire to explore new ways to document and tell stories while experimenting with different media formats and their interaction: photography, video, audio and the internet. New media and transmedia have resulted not only in new production technologies but also in a shift from passive media consumers to active media users. As a consequence, audiences now play a major role as interactive agents that are transforming the uses of media. By acknowledging the current state of how media is being produced, distributed and experienced, documentary storytellers may shed new lights when creating non-fiction media experiences.

This is especially important in areas infested with Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), an annual grass present in more than 100 million acres of the Great Basin. To gather information on forb growth and measure the effects of both native grasses and B. tectorum on forbs, I conducted a greenhouse experiment with 5 native forbs: Lomatium sp., Eriogonum umbellatum, Machaeranthera canescens, Penstemon speciosus, Sphaeralcea munroana; two native grasses: Elymus elymoides and Poa sandbergii; and B. tectorum. Forbs were grown alone or with a grass, and were harvested after 6, 9 or 12 weeks of growth. Excluding Lomatium, which became dormant before week 12, forbs did not differ in shoot relative growth rate when growing alone, but the root relative growth rate of P. speciosus was 50% greater. Neither native grass reduced the biomass of any forb, but growth rate was reduced for two forbs. In contrast, B. tectorum reduced the biomass and growth rates of all forbs, between 50 and 96%. In a second experiment, to test the ability of native forbs to establish and grow with B. tectorum, 4 forb species were grown in plots seeded with densities ranging from 45-360 B. tectorum plants m -Â² at two locations in the Snake River Plain. Water content declined with increasing densities of B. tectorum and forb seedling survival was reduced for 2 species when B. tectorum densities were greater than 150 plants m -Â². Reductions in forb biomass greater than 90% occurred for three species when B. tectorum densities were less than 100 plants m-Â². This study demonstrated that sites with low expected densities of B. tectorum should be selected when seeding forbs, but that native forbs can establish in sites with B. tectorum densities less than 150 plants m -Â², that native grasses and forbs can be used together in seed mixes, and that phonological and morphological characteristics can be used to optimize the diversity of seed mixes.

Precipitation can be induced by bacteria as a by-product of common microbial processes, such as ureolysis. In this process, bacteria hydrolyze urea through a series of reactions which raise the pH of the system. In the presence of calcium ions, this rise in pH shifts the saturation state of the system, allowing for solid calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) to form. The use of these bacteria in biotechnical applications is appealing because urea is a fairly inexpensive substrate, and ureolytic bacteria are common in soil and aquatic environments. Bacteriogenic mineral plugging is an innovative use for this process. This technique controls subsurface fluid movement through the reduction of porosity and permeability of geologic formations, such as oil wells and aquifers. A potential use of this technology is in geologic carbon sequestration, which involves capturing CO 2 and storing it underground in deep saline aquifers. The goal of this project is to determine the kinetics of urea hydrolysis and CaCO 3 precipitation for use in the deep subsurface to mitigate potential leakage pathways of sequestered CO 2. To achieve this goal, three species of ureolytic bacteria, S. pasteurii, B. sphaericus strain 21776, and B. sphaericus strain 21787, were grown in batch systems under static conditions. Kinetic analysis was performed on the data gathered in these experiments. Due to the potential lack of oxygen in the deep subsurface, experiments using S. pasteurii were also carried out under anaerobic conditions. Because of the potential need to manipulate the rate of CaCO 3 precipitation to allow maximum distribution in the deep saline aquifers, the rates of urea hydrolysis and CaCO 3 precipitation among species and between aerobic and anaerobic conditions were compared. All three species studied were capable of inducing calcite precipitation. B. sphaericus strain 21776 exhibited the highest rate coefficient for both ureolysis and CaCO 3 precipitation, while B. sphaericus strain 21787 showed the lowest. S. pasteurii is capable of hydrolyzing urea and inducing calcite precipitation in anaerobic environments, although growth in these environments could not be shown conclusively.

PDT has many potential advantages such as minimal side effects, excellent cosmetic results, and no cellular resistance burdening traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Currently used in the clinic, a limitation is depth of light penetration; therefore, PDT can only be used to treat superficial disease. Our novel PDT agent utilizes two-photon laser technology, which increases the depth of light penetration, greatly increasing the potential uses. Our PDT is able to kill selective cells because the PDT drug has a targeting agent so the drug only goes to cancer cells that overexpress the Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTr2) on their cell surface. Laser light irradiates the cancer cells causing cytotoxic singlet oxygen to be produced damaging the cells. It was observed, through in vivo imaging of the tumors before and after treatment, that vascular flow was diminished as a result of PDT. It is well established that angiogenesis must occur when a tumor reaches a certain size in order for the cells to remain viable and the tumor to continue to grow; therefore, vascular shutdown could be an important mechanism of how PDT works. A series of experiments on the tumor vasculature using in vivo imaging, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy has taken place since this observation to determine what may be happening. Results of these studies have shown that tumor vessels do express the SSTr2 and therefore effected by treatment. Experiments using a somatostatin analog, octreoate, detected by a fluor has shown that the endothelial cells do take the drug up. To ensure that it is blood vessels that were being studied, tumor tissue was stained for both SSTr2 and vonWillebrand Factor (vWF), a recognized endothelial cell marker. Staining patterns for both antibodies were similar. To strengthen the argument, SSTr2- negative tumor cells also showed a positive staining pattern of their vessels, demonstrating that even though the tumor cells are SSTr2- negative, the tumor vessels can be SSTr2-positive and thus responsive to PDT.

In fact, an appropriate level of anxiety allows for the optimal performance of any task. There are times, however, when anxiety becomes problematic, undermining one's confidence and ultimately his or her performance. For teachers, there is a specific anxiety, teaching anxiety, which can lead to long term struggles in the classroom. Teaching anxiety appears to be a predicament for a significant number of post-secondary educators; yet little data were found on the subject. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine perceptions regarding the sources and effects of teaching anxiety among two-year college faculty. The aim was to assemble details about those college faculty members' insights through an assessment of their perspectives on the sources and effects of teaching anxiety. The study was directed by the following central research question: What do two- year college faculty members perceive as the sources and effects of teaching anxiety? The following subquestions further clarified the direction of the study: (1) How do the participants describe their own or their colleagues' experiences with teaching anxiety? (2) What do the participants understand about both the immediate and long-term effects of teaching anxiety? (3) How do those participants cope with teaching anxiety if they experience(d) it? To propose a grounded theory, this study utilized partially structured one-on-one interviews with two-year college faculty to illuminate the intrinsic properties of their perceptions about teaching anxiety. A conceptual model of inter-related perceptions concerning the sources and effects of teaching anxiety emerged from the data.	['persons', 'school employees', 'employees', 'teachers']

Consequently, quality and first to market have become the goals of many engineering firms. This in turn has put pressure on engineering education programs to produce professionals proficient and able to design quality products fast. Researchers have studied design from many different perspectives. One of the perspectives is the role of representations in design. Internal representations belong in our mental world while external representations are in our physical world. This thesis provides experimental evidence on the role of electrical engineering external representations on three design outcomes. The basis of this thesis is a framework developed by Goel (1995). Goel's framework of notationality classifies external representations into three categories: notational, discursive, and non-notational systems. Non-notational systems are essential for creativity because they encourage lateral transformations and discourage vertical transformations during design. Consequently, this improves design outcome because it encourages divergence and prevents premature convergence. Lateral and vertical transformations are cognitive movements between and within ideas respectively. This thesis attempts to test Goel's theory by performing a 23 factorial design experiment in the electrical engineering domain. The three factors are the three categories of external representations and the response variables are solution quality, productivity of design, and the number of ideas generated. This thesis also briefly explores transformations relation to outcome variables and representations. Analysis of variance technique with the data reveals that the use of non-notational and discursive systems increases solution quality and productivity of design. Use of notational systems increases the number of ideas generated, which contradicts Goel's (1995) theory. Lateral transformations are better correlated to quality than are vertical transformations. The experimental results indicate that use of a variety of external representations leads to better design outcomes, specifically representations of non-notational and discursive systems. Electrical engineering instructors may want to formally teach students to design by using non-notational and discursive systems and also re-consider their textbook selection criteria.

The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), functions as a negative feedback signal that turns off pro-inflammatory mediators during the immune response. IL-6 also initiates the release of CRP, which induces inflammation. Therefore, IL-6 is known as both a pro and anti-inflammatory mediator of the immune response. IL-6 is released during the immune response to inflammation. IL-6 peaks about 8 hours after an eccentric exercise session that induces muscle damage. Carbohydrate ingestion during endurance exercise attenuates the rise in IL-6 immediately post-exercise during recovery. IL-6 along with the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) (a marker of the systemic inflammatory response), and creatine kinase (CK) (a semi-quantitative marker of muscle damage), will be used to determine the affects of eccentric exercise on muscle damage and the inflammatory response. Purpose: To determine whether IL-6, CRP and CK, following eccentric exercise differ with a carbohydrate supplement versus a placebo. Methods: The study was a double-blind, cross-over design. Male and female subjects consumed a carbohydrate or placebo beverage the day of and day after the eccentric exercise. Subjects also consumed a controlled diet the day before, day of and the day after the exercise session. The diet consisted of 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 20% protein. The exercise session was two bouts of an eccentric exercise using the bicep muscle, three weeks apart, to induce muscle damage and initiate an inflammatory response. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine whether carbohydrate ingestion influenced IL-6, CRP and CK. Results: Carbohydrate increased the rise in IL-6 8 hours post-exercise compared to placebo. An increase in arm circumference at 8, 12 and 120 hours and subjective soreness at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-exercise was indicative of muscle damage. Conclusion: Carbohydrate increased the local inflammatory response following resistance exercise, but had no effects on CRP and CK. This study is the first to show that carbohydrate following eccentric exercise has an effect on the local inflammatory response.

Differences in student learning have required classes that cover the same subject to be taught differently. Observations of which students are taking more science than required did not fit the preconceived notions; students in a nontraditional science class would be less likely to take a fourth year of science as opposed to those taking the traditional science class designed for the college bound. This study looked at how the students' experiences influence their outcomes in different chemistry classes. In Belle Plaine, MN there are two choices of Chemistry offered, traditional verses context-based. Each of these classes provide the student with a different experience in how they learn chemistry. The data collection and analysis revolved around two major themes. These themes answer the sub-questions dealing with the student's motivation and the student's performance.

However, because climate records for the region are limited to the 20th century, studies on the impacts of long-duration variations in climate on physical and ecosystem processes were limited. Therefore, a reconstruction of summer moisture variability (June - August) spanning A.D. 1540-2000 was created from a multi-species network of tree-ring chronologies sampled in Glacier National Park. The reconstruction shows decadal-scale shifts between drought and pluvial events with a pronounced cool/wet period spanning the end of the Little Ice Age (A.D. 1770-1840). The single most exceptional drought event occurred over the 20th century (A.D. 1917-1941) and was associated with the most spatially consistent drought regime throughout the northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest over the past ~500 yrs. Among a wider spatial network of hydroclimatic reconstructions arrayed along a north-south Rocky Mountain transect, trends at Glacier National Park were found to be most similar to those in the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Also, many decadal-scale drought/pluvial events were consistent among all sites along the north-south transect - although magnitude, intensity, and time of onset varied. To investigate climatic drivers related to the Little Ice Age glacial maximum and rapid 20th-century retreat, I explored the impact of north Pacific Basin sea-surface temperature anomalies on low-frequency variations in winter snowpack for the park. Temperature anomalies in the north Pacific basin exhibit tight linkages to variations in snowpack; therefore, I used a tree-ring based reconstruction of north Pacific temperature variability and summer drought as proxies for winter glacial accumulation and summer ablation, respectively, over the past three centuries (A.D. 1700-2000). These records show that the 1850's glacial maximum was likely produced by ~70 yrs of cool/wet summers coupled with high snowpack. Glacial retreat coincided with an extended period (>50 yr) of summer drought and low snowpack culminating in the exceptional events of 1917-1941 when retreat rates exceeded 100 m/yr. This research highlights the difficulty in detecting regional expression of global climate change when 'natural' decadal-scale variations in climate are regionally common.

Few rural children's EH studies targeting multiple exposure pathways have been conducted. It is recommended that EH programs be framed and delivered in a manner meaningful to families and high-risk subgroups. This research addresses two questions: 1.) What are the risk avoidance behaviors regarding environmental tobacco smoke, radon, well water contamination, lead, and CO among a sample of rural households? 2.) Is there a difference in perception of risk between households that undertake risk avoidance actions and those that do not? Answers to these questions advised educational intervention construction. Participants were referred by public health nurses (PHN) serving pediatric programs within the Gallatin City County Health Department. All participants met specific enrollment criteria. Baseline biomonitoring, household exposure and self-reported knowledge/attitude/behavior (KAB) data were completed for 31 rural families. Biomarker data was collected from each child under age 6, each home was tested for radon and CO, and well water was processed using a well screen. Questionnaire data was collected from each child and adult. Questionnaire components addressed demographics, KAB towards agents, resources, risk reduction and acceptability of risk reduction behaviors, child's health history and behaviors, potential exposures and parent's occupations. Biological data results were analyzed for each agent in each home. Results show smoking households perceive significant risk of children's exposure to ETS, but do not perceive that exposure leads to severe health consequences. Only 17.5% of households engage in radon testing. Parents who don't test for radon are guided by misconceptions and fear that remediation is costly and effort-intensive. Two-thirds of households have CO detectors. Those that do not, perceive no risk to children. More households engaged in treating their water than in testing. Knowledge of well water contamination and testing issues were limited. Blood lead results indicate that public lead campaigns have been successful in disseminating lead information. Results indicate a significant need for educational interventions to dismantle social and contextual barriers to protective behavior modification and that interventions can be successfully administered by a PHN.

Prior to the project, I found my students to be able to take basic chemistry information and work with it at the time, but find limitations in their abilities to transfer the concepts that were learned to other paths or to use them in other situations in the class after they were taught. I investigated their ability to understand chemistry concepts better using HOCS, their ability to answer HOCS questions, their retention of chemistry concepts in long-term memory as a result of HOCS, their attitudes about learning chemistry through HOCS, and attitudes regarding planning and implementation of HOCS units. The results were very indecisive from this study, however, there was support that HOCS may lead to better understanding of chemistry concepts overall. Additionally, it was determined that students did not think they liked learning via HOCS, but that surveys that compared nontreatment and treatment units supported their preference to HOCS.

Currently, methodologies used for characterizing biofilm heterogeneity are constrained by the need of in vitro biofilm growth and by the need to genetically manipulate bacteria. This dissertation describes findings obtained by using LCMM, qRT-PCR, qPCR and microarrays. Through combining LCMM with qRT-PCR a housekeeping gene and two quorum sensing induced genes were found to be differentially expressed at the periphery of P. aeruginosa biofilms. qPCR also enabled the growth rate of cells in discrete locations of biofilms to be determined. Cells localized to the deep layers of biofilms were found in a growth state analogous to stationary phase in planktonic cultures, while cells localized to the biofilm periphery were slightly more active with growth rates that approached cells growing exponentially in planktonic cultures. By elucidating the growth rates of subpopulations within the biofilm it was subsequently possible to determine that the most active cells had approximately 7 copies of the mRNA of housekeeping and stationary phase associated genes. Each of the least active cells, those found in the deeper sections of the biofilms, had less than one copy of any of the mRNAs measured. No significant differences in the distribution of 16S rRNA were found along the sections analyzed. The microarray studies revealed several genes, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, to be undergoing active transcription in young biofilms under conditions of low calcium concentrations. This is significant because calcium homeostasis is known to be out of balance in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, where P. aeruginosa biofilms grow causing life threatening infections. These results suggest that spatial and temporal heterogeneity within biofilms underscores their ability to not only survive in diverse and sometimes harsh environmental conditions, but to exploit those environments. The methods described in this work are suitable for characterizing heterogeneity of gene expression and growth rate in biofilms collected from their natural environment. These also represent an alternative method for assessing the distribution of populations in multispecies biofilms.

"My Action Research Project connects the Envirothon contest with a traditional biology classroom. In the Envirothon, a national environmental contest, teams of high school students work together outdoors, solving site-based natural resource questions and problems in aquatics, forestry, soils, wildlife, and a current environmental issue. During this competition, teams rotate from Station to Station, working on a variety of ""hands on"" tasks specific to each environmental area; the students are also tested on sets of questions that cover a very wide range of information for each topic. ""Envirothon Teaching Methods"" typically used to successfully prepare teams for this competition involve bringing in knowledgeable professionals to help students learn about each of these environmental areas. The lessons, presented by local natural resource people with expertise and experience, usually focus on providing students with ""real world"" information. Students typically learn in an outdoor setting and/or use local materials and resources. ""Hands on"" authentic activities are emphasized as an important way to increase student comprehension of environmental subject matter. In this Action Research Project, I incorporated the same teaching methods commonly used to train students for Envirothon contests into my high school College Biology course. When used by an entire class of students within a traditional school day setting, Envirothon teaching methods had positive impacts on students' comprehension of environmental topics."

In addition, recent estimates show newly graduated nurse turnover rates range from 14% to 60% during their first years of practice. A purposeful review of the literature was performed in order to gain insight into the process of transitioning from student to practicing nurse and to determine needs, experiences, and outcomes associated with newly graduated nurses in acute care settings. Once common intellectual, emotional, socio-cultural, and physical experiences were identified, an educational pamphlet was constructed. The purpose of creating such a pamphlet was to provide useful information, highlight specific common needs, and suggest resources and strategies to supplement newly graduated nurses throughout their transition period and socialization process. Current research shows newly graduated nurses can successfully transition into acute care settings with the provision of pertinent information; the guidance from key stakeholders including, educators, managers, and administrators; and the support of preceptorship, mentorship, and orientation programs. Positive transitional periods are associated with increased reports of job satisfaction and with lower voluntary turnover rates among newly graduated nurses.

In order to determine whether instruction of what learning is and metacognitive reading strategies would improve science literacy and confidence in science; students were given instruction in different learning styles and reading strategies for use in and out of the classroom. Learning logs during reading, concept maps to assess knowledge and regulatory checklists were used to determine if student learning improved. Reading comprehension was measured before and during treatment. Students did not show a marked increase in use of these strategies after the treatment; however reading comprehension and attitudes toward science improved.

The disruptions studied in this research are of two types - machine failure and job release-time. The study was conducted using modified classical job shop problems with the minimize maximum completion time (Cmax) objective. Best random non-delay schedules (BRS) provided job sequences for each machine. Different slack policies based on frequency, duration and location of slacks in the schedule were used to strategically insert slack in the BRS schedule. The resulting robust schedules proactively managed machine or job releasetime disruptions. The change in Cmax quantified schedule robustness. Simulation was used to generate and modify the BRS schedules with and without slacks and disruptions, simulate disruption events and evaluate schedule performance. It was observed that policies that equally distribute slack to all tasks on heavily utilized machines and those that equally distribute slack to all tasks on all machines performed best. When the number of jobs to process was more than the number of machines and ""big jobs"" with long processing times on heavily utilized machines were present, the policy distributing slack tasks equally on heavily utilized machines exhibited superior performance. For systems with less variability both policies performed equally well. By comparing the average, minimum and maximum schedule deviations across all policies, the study concluded that strategically distributing slack to tasks on heavily utilized machines results in good robust schedules that can absorb the effects of disruptions."

Results for classical problems from the literature demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of the approach. Application is also shown for reentrant flexible job shop with sequence dependent setup times (RFJSSDS), a new, very general, class of problems. RFJSSDS is a generalization of the classical job shop, reentrant flow shop and flexible job shop problems. Multiple products (routes), sequence dependent setup times at the work centers and reentrancy of the jobs make RFJSSDS one of the more general and difficult shop scheduling problems. Examples of this type of problem include semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities and flexible machining systems. The solution methodology developed in this study features a new Simulation Based Local Improvement with Multi Start (SBLIMS) algorithm. The local search procedure modifies an initial feasible solution provided by the simulation module to generate promising neighbor solutions. A generated solution is considered to be better if there is a reduction in the total completion time or makespan. A unique filtering strategy is used to select and rank moves, using both task and resource views of a schedule. Multiple random starting points are generated in multistart fashion as part of the solution process. New theorems are presented that form the basis for SBLIMS. The SBLIMS algorithm was evaluated using test instances for several shop scheduling problems as well as RFJSSDS. A set of synthetic problems was generated to study RFJSSDS, because there were no RFJSSDS instances available from the literature. The SBLIMS algorithm was compared with various dispatch rules in the RFJSSDS domain and its performance was found to be better in most cases. SBLIMS was also tested with well known special cases of RFJSSDS: the classical job shop, reentrant flow shop and flexible job shop problems. The SBLIMS algorithm provided excellent results compared with those provided in the literature, establishing the generality of the approach for solving a broad class of shop scheduling problems.

Rare Conservation is one NGO that utilizes music videos as an innovative technique to reach a younger audience in order to foster a sense of pride and concern for the environment in which they live. In 1992, RARE Conservation produced a music video for the song ""Quincy Rap"" by Tony (The Obeah Man) McKay. The ""Quincy Rap"" music video was one environmental tool in the overall campaign to save the endangered and endemic Bahamian Parrot. By analyzing the ""Quincy Rap"" music video, a guideline for creating persuasive music videos can be constructed. In order to analyze a music video, like ""Quincy Rap,"" it is best to take a multi-perspective approach, first dissecting the visual elements of the video then looking at the audio elements and then concluding with how the visual and audio elements intersect. By juxtaposing music video techniques with those found in other forms of video production, certain persuasive elements of music video production can be highlighted. This unique rhetoric of music videos can be utilized as persuasive environmental education."	['auxiliary sciences of history', 'education', 'environmental education', 'civilization']

From my own observation and interaction with my students, I have always thought that my students understand the concepts I am teaching. However, when it comes to taking tests and doing assessments in these areas students do not seem to demonstrate the knowledge and understanding required. Through my readings, I have noticed the use of rubrics as an important assessment technique, which can help students perform well on a given task. As a result, I have decided to investigate what will be the effect of using rubric-based formative assessment on students understanding and motivation to learn chemistry. I chose my 10th grade chemistry class as the focus on my project. Baseline comparison data were collected during a nontreatment unit on atomic structure through the use of pre, post and delayed concept map, interviews, surveys, and traditional assessments test. I then implemented two treatment units that utilized rubric-based assessment. The first treatment unit focused on ionic bonding and compounds and the second focused on covalent bonding and compounds. These two treatment units incorporated the use of pre, post, and delayed concept maps, interviews, survey, projects, labs, unit test and self-reflections journal. After I analyzed pre and postunit concept maps, interviews and surveys, I determined that the implementation of rubric-based assessment did not have any significant improvement on students understanding. The data from the post and delayed assessment concept maps, interviews, surveys and unit test indicated that students' long-term memory increased. Students' responses on the student survey, and my reflective journal entries indicated that students were responding very positive to the different types of assessments being utilized with the incorporation of rubrics and that their long-term memory, attitude, motivation were increased. As a result, my attitude and motivation towards teaching chemistry also increased.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

This paper contrasts previous studies of the use of animation and CGI in documentary filmmaking with issues generated by some of the more recent evolutions in the field. I find that although the public may have more difficulty understanding the link between an animated image on the screen and its real world referent, when used effectively animations and virtual realities can offer a new, though potentially problematic, range of storytelling tools.

In an attempting to create things we should embrace poetry because it begins to tap into our basic transcendental and mysterious way of experiencing the world. Our immediate and poetic experiences of the world are not only the beginnings of knowledge and reason, but by embracing poetry, we are also embracing a metaphysical and spiritual quality to the work. This pure way, which allows us to both create, experience, and know the world poetically is crucial to understanding a reality that is determined in each moment of 'becoming' and 'perishing' by what is in essence 'feelings'. By 'feeling' nature in its constant and flowing state of 'becoming' and 'perishing' we can begin to understand the 'true' nature of reality. The worldview that supports the universe as constantly in a state of 'becoming' and 'perishing', and interconnected is from process-relational thought. Acknowledging everything as determined by 'feelings', or what we as humans perceive as emotions, which are the true components of our poetic knowledge and found in our basic intuition, leads us to desire an architecture that is truly poetic and spiritual by evoking emotions from the dynamic changes found in nature.

Little research has been conducted on the adaptive processes of grandparent caregivers and the coping mechanisms they employ to deal with parenting the second time around. The current study was based on qualitative data generated from 26 in-depth, face-to-face interviews with grandparents who were rearing their grandchildren. Interviews were conducted with 10 grandfathers and 23 grandmothers who were the sole care providers of their grandchildren. The majority of grandparents were providing care for their grandchildren due to their adult child's substance abuse and/or mental illness. During each interview, a semi-structured interview protocol was followed. These interviews began by generating a genogram of the family system, including four generations of the family: the grandparents' parents, the grandparents, their adult children, and their grandchildren. This study was guided by McCubbin and Patterson's Double ABCX Model as well as Boss' Family Stress Model, which situates custodial grandparents within external and internal contexts. The study explored the following research questions: What are the adaptation processes used by grandfamilies? And what coping strategies and resources do custodial grandparents employ to ameliorate their familial stressors? The goal of this study was to explore grandparents' key processes that facilitate successful family adaptation and resilience. Findings revealed that grandparents in this study made at least five salient shifts in their family functioning. Caregivers shifted their identities; their roles; their relationships with family, friends, and communities; their resources (e.g., social supports, government assistance); and their perceptions in order to best meet the needs of their grandchildren. The grandfamilies' adaptation processes were influenced by both external and internal contexts. Understanding custodial grandparents' resilient pathways may hold important implications for future programs and policies intended to better support these families.

Repeated days of recreational skiing were thought to increase stress markers, induce fatigue, and hinder ski performance and enjoyment. PURPOSE: To examine the physiological changes that occur in recreational skiers from elevations below 460 meters over five days of vacation skiing. METHODS: Fourteen skiers, four females (Mean Â± SD; Age (yrs): 41.3 Â± 6.2), ten males (47.9 Â± 11.2) participated in the study. Nine skiers were considered advanced skiers (7 males, 2 females) and five intermediate skiers (3 males, 2 females). Subjects arrived at Bridger Bowl Ski Area, Bozeman MT to ski for five days. Each subject filled out subjective scales, had their resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured as well as blood drawn for creatine kinase analysis. Samples were taken on days 1, 3, and 5. Subjects skied for three hours in the morning at a self selected pace and on self selected runs. They came in for lunch and recorded their rating of perceived exertion (RPE). The researcher downloaded the data from the heart rate monitor. The subjects skied in the afternoon until a self determined end time and again recorded their RPE and gave the researcher their heart rate monitors; the researcher then gave directions for the following day. RESULTS: The variables of ski time, number of runs, heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective scales did not change significantly. However, RPE was significantly increased suggesting an increase amount of perceptual fatigue. Creatine kinase was did not increase until one outlier was removed. Significant creatine kinase (p=0.001) and RPE results strongly suggests that subjects were stressed even without a decrease in runs, or ski time. CONCLUSION: The current study supports previous research; repeated days of skiing was not a fatiguing enough event to hinder ski performance or enjoyment. Future studies should examine whether repeated days of skiing results in a positive contribution to physical fitness.

The ever-increasing popularity of portable devices, like the iPhone, means that viewers are watching more content on smaller screens than ever before. At the same time, movie theatres and Imax screens are still as popular as ever and seeing something on the big screen holds some kind of magic for the viewer. This fact has not been lost on environmental filmmakers who are increasingly finding ways of using different sized screens to promote their cause. Ultimately, the size of the screen not only determines what viewers watch, and how they are affected by what they see, but can actually be the deciding factor for whether they take action on an issue.

Conifer cover increase in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) has been documented by historical photos, but the rate and extent remain unquantified. Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels have focused research attention on carbon budgeting. Carbon sinks associated with conifer cover increase are believed to account for a fraction of the Î²missing carbon sink,Î³ although estimates of the fraction are highly uncertain. I examined changes in conifer cover and aboveground carbon across biophysical gradients in the GYE using a combination of aerial photos, satellite imagery, field data, allometric equations, and statistical techniques. I quantified the percent conifer cover for samples in 1971 and 1999 to determine the frequency and rate of conifer cover increase. I used satellite image change detection to map the extent of conifer cover increase and aerial photo interpretation to quantify the rates of conifer cover increase. I then estimated aboveground carbon stocks for 1985 and 1999 and quantified the source/sink dynamics associated with conifer cover increase and other trajectories of forest change. I determined that the area of conifer forest increased by 7% during the period 1971-1999, at highly variable rates depending upon elevation, aspect, vegetation type, and proximity to conifer forest. Much of the variation in the rates of change was associated with gradients of soil moisture. Conifer cover increased across 685,075 ha between 1985-1999 and was responsible for the aboveground sequestration of 369 Gg C yr-1, offsetting 34% of the carbon source associated with widespread fire and logging during that time period. Climate variability, fire suppression, grazing dynamics, and elevated atmospheric CO2 levels are the hypothesized determinants of conifer cover increase. Although it is likely that no single factor is singularly responsible, fire frequency has been sufficiently reduced throughout the GYE, and the majority of carbon uptake occurred in forest types adapted to frequent fire. The temporal duration of a carbon sink associated with conifer cover increase therefore remains in question.

The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is superimposed over much of the Williston Basin and provides critical habitats for migratory birds and waterfowl. Surface and shallow groundwaters in the PPR often contain high levels of total dissolved solids (TDS); however, salts produced from energy development are chemically different than the near-surface salts. To differentiate between saline contaminated and naturally high TDS water samples, Reiten and Tischmak (1993) developed a Contamination Index (CI = chloride concentration / specific conductance), with contamination indicated by values above 0.035. The Goose Lake study area in Sheridan County, Montana lies within the PPR and has a documented history of saline contamination. Local stratigraphy consists of coarse grained glacial outwash deposits overlying clay-rich glacial till, with extensive contamination in the saturated outwash deposits and wetlands evidenced from 1989 water samples. In 2009, water samples were analyzed from thirty locations including twenty six sites sampled in 1989 to determine changes in chemistry. Additionally, geophysical surveys were conducted to determine stratigraphic controls on contaminant transport using a Geonics EM-31 and EM-34. Widespread contamination was documented in 2009, with one water sample considered uncontaminated based upon the CI data. Two uncontaminated groundwater wells in 1989 had 2009 CI values indicating contamination, documenting the increased aerial extent of contamination due to down-gradient transport. Significant reductions in the median CI values from sites contaminated in 1989 were observed. Assuming reductions in CI values continue at the same rate, contamination would remain for roughly 140 years at the most contaminated site. Geophysical studies showed elevated apparent conductivities associated with saline contamination throughout the study. Contaminant transport is mainly occurring laterally within the outwash deposits, and is evident a minimum of 1,600 m from the source. In contrast, saline penetration into the underlying till is likely less than 30 m. These results demonstrate the potential for co-produced water contamination to aquatic resources far down-gradient of oil and gas developments in glacial outwash deposits within the PPR.

All neutron stars exhibit irregularities in their spin rates, which may be evidence of coupling between the solid crust and liquid components in the interior. We study short-time scale correlations in the stochastic variations in spin rate, timing noise, in 32 pulsars. Upon subtraction of low frequency wander, we find that in two stars a fluctuation in rotational phase at a given time is correlated with past fluctuations over a correlation time of ~Ì 10-40 d; over longer times, the fluctuations are uncorrelated. We interpret this result as the signature of a damped rotational mode in the star, excited by the noise process, and likely due to friction between the crust and interior liquid. In the second part of this thesis, we investigate the thermal and magnetic evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars, magnetars. We explore a thermo-resistive instability in the outer crusts of magnetars wherein a perturbation in temperature increases ohmic heating. We show that magnetars of characteristic age T age ~ 10 4 yr are unstable over timescales as short as days if strong current sheets are present in the outer crust. This instability could play an important role in the thermal and magnetic field evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars, and may be related to bursting activity in magnetars.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of indomethacin on capillary permeability in animals with signs of systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that the permeability of an individual capillary would be lower after a shear stress challenge in the presence of indomethacin when evidence of systemic infection was present in the animal. Frogs (n=13) were pithed and the mesentery was exposed, hydraulic conductivity (L p) was assessed at 30 cm H 2O using the modified Landis technique after an abrupt change in shear stress. Two capillaries from each frog were used; one was a control and one with indomethacin superfused over the tissue. The frogs showed a systemic infection (nitro blue tetrazolium activation) but individual capillaries had no evidence of rolling or sticking white cells. There was a significant decrease in L p (P=0.002) when comparing the control and treatment vessels. The results of the analysis indicate capillary L p assessed in mesentery of infected frogs, decreased when exposed to shear stress and indomethacin. The data imply that gaps between endothelial cells may get smaller when indomethacin is introduced into the system decreasing the flow of fluids out of the capillary.

Biofilm structural development is a dynamic process dependent on many cellular and environmental parameters including Quorum Sensing (QS) and hydrodynamics. Since QS is dependent on a threshold autoinducer concentration, it was hypothesized that the flow dynamics in the bulk fluid surrounding the biofilm would play an important role in expression of QS and the genes that are under its control. In order to investigate the relative contribution of hydrodynamics and QS on biofilm development, biofilms were grown from wild type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and the cell signaling lasI mutant PAO1-JP1 under laminar and turbulent flows. When morphology of the biofilms were quantified using Image Structure Analyzer (ISA) software, a multivariate analysis demonstrated that both QS and hydrodynamics influenced biofilm structure, suggesting that QS was not required for biofilm development but affected structural heterogeneity in biofilms. GFP reporter based gene expression analysis of QS regulated lasB (coding for elastase) expression during biofilm development in laminar flow further supported these results. Detachment has been recognized as another factor that may define structural morphology of biofilms. Under flow conditions hollow biofilm clusters were formed as a result of active detachment process, termed as ""seeding dispersal"". A differentiation of a ""seeding"" microcolony into an interior motile, swarming, phenotype and a non-motile surrounding, ""wall phenotype"" formed as a prelude to the dispersal process in which the interior cells swarmed out of the microcolony from local break out points and spread over the wall of the flow cell. A critical microcolony diameter of approximately 100 Ã¦m was required for differentiation suggesting that regulation was related to cell density and mass transfer conditions. It was found that rhamnolipid (rhlA-) biosurfactant was not required and QS system (PAO1-JP2) was shown to be important in this process, possibly by sensing nutrient limitation within the biofilm microcolonies. These results strengthen a current view of multi-cellularity and coordinated behavior in prokaryotes as well as a dynamic network of overlapping pathways and cellular mechanisms that act on biofilm development in a complex interrelated manner."

The effectiveness of classroom lessons and action projects on student's environmental behaviors were evaluated. The student's environmental awareness and voluntary environmental behaviors were monitored throughout the year by in class surveys, short answer responses, informal classroom discussions/interviews and teacher journals. Findings suggest that changing voluntary behaviors is not a quick and easy process. However, the researcher was able to see continued voluntary environmental behaviors in a portion of the students after the completion of action projects.

Despite two centuries of effort, the debate on the relationship of art and science is far from resolved; the notion that they are exclusive of each other is even less established. However, there remains a tendency to treat art and science as the two extremes of a linear scale of talent. Only an exceptional person, therefore, can straddle the line between them. The traditional science documentary aggravates this separation. Condensing the time and effort involved, through re-enactments of selected experiments, neglects the artisanal, hands-on nature of science. By spotlighting one (or at most a handful) of scientists as special, and condensing a large body of work into a small number of significant events, the documentaries give the impression that creativity in science is a rare occurrence. A new model of science film, based on the personal essay that is prominent in popular science writing (e.g., the essays of Alan Lightman), is proposed to ease the tension between art and science. The essay film, combining elements of the documentary and the personal art film, provides the opportunity to illustrate science as an inherently creative act relevant to all people.

Thirty ewes were randomly allocated to 3 confinement pens and 30 ewes were randomly allocated to 3 grazing plots. The study was conducted September 25 to October 15, 2010 and September 6 to 19, 2011. Targhee ewes (65.4 Â± 5.84 kg BW) were used in 2010. Rambouillet ewes (61.9 Â± 6.28 kg BW) were used in 2011. Ewes had ad libitum access to food, water, and a mineral supplement containing 11 to 12.5% salt with 2% titanium dioxide added as an external marker to estimate individual mineral intake. Forage intake was calculated using estimates of fecal output obtained by dosing gelatin capsules containing 2 g chromic oxide every day for 14 d, and in vitro 48-h DM indigestibility. Fecal grab samples were collected from each individual ewe for a period of 7 d and composited by ewe. Forage and mineral intakes were analyzed using individual ewe as the experimental unit. A year x treatment interaction (P < 0.01) existed for forage DMI and mineral DMI. Ewes in confinement consumed more forage than grazing ewes in 2010 (2.60 vs. 1.86 kg/d, respectively), but less than grazing ewes in 2011 (1.99 vs. 2.49 kg/d, respectively). Mean mineral intake was highest (P < 0.01) by grazing ewes in 2011 and 2010 (average 69 g/d), intermediate by ewes in confinement in 2010 (57 g/d), and lowest by ewes in confinement in 2011 (31 g/d). A year x treatment interaction (P = 0.05) existed for mineral DMI CV. Mineral DMI CV was higher (P = 0.04) for the confinement treatment than the grazing treatment in 2011 (67.2 vs. 33.7%), but similar for confinement and grazing treatments in 2010 (55.4 vs. 46.5%, respectively). In this study, both swath grazing ewes and ewes in confinement consumed more mineral than recommended by the mineral manufacturer and the NRC indicating that more research is needed to develop a better understanding of the factors that regulate and impact mineral intake.

Wintertime respiration accounts for a significant contribution of the annual carbon loss to the atmosphere from terrestrial ecosystems, but the magnitude of this flux and physical transport mechanisms through snow are unclear. This research examines wintertime CO 2 flux in a lodgepole pine forest in the Upper Stringer Creek catchment at the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, Montana, USA. I hypothesized that: CO 2 production and efflux during the winter contributes a significant amount (10-20%)of CO 2 efflux to the atmosphere in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest; 2) Snow properties, i.e. depth and density, and thereby porosity and tortuosity vary during the winter via snow metamorphosis, thus changing the impediment to flux through the snow medium and CO 2 production increases when the snowpack becomes isothermal during melt due to increased soil moisture and soil temperature. A micrometeorological stations was installed to measure soil water content, soil temperature, incoming and outgoing radiation, albedo, snow depth, snow/soil interface CO 2 concentration, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, three-dimensional wind speed, and above snow/sub-canopy CO 2 flux on a half-hourly basis. In addition, throughout the winters of 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 snow pit analyses was performed in triplicate approximately once monthly and snow depth, density, and temperature were measured in 10-centimeter increments. Three methodological approaches were used to analyze CO 2 flux through the snow pack: Chamber on snow, two-point Fick's law based diffusivity modeling, and snow-surface/subcanopy eddy covariance. The results of the comparison show a significant difference in measured and estimated flux between methodologies during early and late winter, while demonstrating the Fick's based model is can accurately estimate up 75% of measured flux during mid-winter. Observations are consistent with advection, in addition to diffusion, as a mechanism of CO 2 transport through snow such that observation strategies that do not account for advection may underestimate wintertime efflux. Furthermore, all three methodologies indicate that wintertime respiration is a major contributor to the annual carbon budget when mean flux rates are compared to growing season flux rates.

A finite element code, written in C++, was developed that solved both the Navier-Stokes and Advection-Diffusion equation monolithically. When modeling nanoparticles, the regular finite element method becomes unstable, and, in order resolve this issue, various stabilization methods were consider including Streamline Upwind, Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin and Galerkin Least Square. In order to validate the various types of stabilization, the stabilized finite element solution was compared to the analytical Graetz solution. The comparison was done by calculation an approximation of the L 2 - error, and the best stabilization method was found to be Galerkin Least Square. Also in this thesis, we found that the Crank-Nicolson time stepping scheme is not the best option for the human airways simulations problem, and this is due to both the complex nature of the geometry and the Crank-Nicolson method lacks the ability to damp out error when the problem is advection dominated. However, using Crank-Nicolson in straight tube geometry with various stabilization methods provides better accuracy than other second-order time stepping schemes, such as BDF-2. The type of stabilization method used when d < 10 nm does matter since Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin introduces higher deposition fraction compared to Galerkin Least Square. This statement is not true when d > 10 nm, since mesh refinement is important at this range. In the human airways simulation, we found that for d = 1 nm the concentration distribution is uniform compared to d = 150 nm , where localized concentration exists. This implies a potential health risk when inhaling nanoparticles because nanoparticles have a very high surface area and the potential for exposure is much greater. The stabilization methods tested in this thesis show promise for modeling nanoparticle transport in the human airways.

However, when memory is tested in a way that allows for reliance on familiarity, age-related declines are eliminated. Recent research has indicated that on a number of tests of PM, no age-related memory deficits were found. It is hypothesized that such tests allow older adults to rely on familiarity to detect the PM cue. The current study uses a PM task on which reliance on familiarity will lead to a measurable error that can be distinguished from a general PM deficit. It is hypothesized that older adults will make more familiarity-based errors than younger adults while performing worse overall.

Spatial patterns of DNA replication and protein synthetic activity were imaged by techniques developed using staphylococcal systems. The first technique measures DNA synthetic activity by pulse-labeling with the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by immunofluorescent detection of brominated DNA. The second technique makes use of an inducible green fluorescent protein construct that can be used to detect the capacity for de novo protein synthesis. These techniques were applied to biofilms grown in three different reactor systems. In all cases, measurements revealed that even in simple single-species biofilms, complex spatial distributions of anabolic activity occur. In a colony biofilm system, two distinct regions of DNA synthetic activity were observed, one close to the nutrient interface and another adjacent to the air interface. A similar pattern was measured by GFP induction. The dimensions of DNA synthetic activity ranged from 25 to 31 um and the average protein synthetic activity ranged from 36 to 38 um at the air interface. When pure oxygen was introduced, a wider zone of active DNA replication (45 um) and GFP synthesis (59 um) was measured at the gas interface. Oxygen penetration calculated (26um) corresponds with the zones of respiratory activity (19 to 38 um), DNA synthetic activity and protein synthetic activity measured at the air interface. The dimensions of DNA synthetic activity and protein synthesis activity at the nutrient interface ranged from 13 um to 19 um. The addition of glucose to the media increased the zone of protein synthesis at the nutrient interface to 33 um. Stratified patterns of activity were also observed in biofilms developed in two continuous flow reactors. While biofilms harbor regions of active anabolism, the techniques also demonstrate that these biofilms contain regions of complete inactivity. Such inactive zones may contribute to the special ecology of biofilms and tolerance to antimicrobial agents. The techniques, particularly BrdU labeling, are generic and may find application to many microbial biofilm systems.

Few studies have been conducted to determine if interactions exist in the utilization of Cu when increasing levels of supplementary Zn were offered. The objectives of this research were to: first determine what effect protein source (plant vs. animal based), Cu source (complex vs. inorganic) and concentrations of Cu (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 ppm) in the diet had on rate and efficiency of gain and Cu tissue levels in rainbow trout. The second experiment was to determine if interactions occur due to increasing diet content of Zn (0, 30, 300, 1500 ppm) and Cu provided at two levels (0 or 10 ppm) on tissue levels of Cu in rainbow trout. From experiment one, trout fed plant-based diet had higher (P < 0.05) ADG and improved (P < 0.05) FCR in comparison to fishmeal fed trout. Highest (P < 0.05) hepatic Cu concentrations were also observed in trout fed plant-based diets. No differences (P >0.05) were observed in growth or hepatic concentrations due to Cu source. From experiment two, no antagonistic interactions were observed between increasing levels of dietary Zn and Cu. Trout fed the two highest levels of dietary Zn (300 and 1500 ppm) had the greatest (P < 0.05) weight gains. Dietary Zn supplementation increased (P < 0.05) whole body Cu at 12 wks. With increasing dietary Zn supplementation, resulted in increased (P < 0.05) whole body Zn. Cataracts and tail rot were observed at 12 wks in trout fed the Cu and Zn deficient diet. In conclusion, plant-based diets enhanced Cu bioavailability indicated by higher weight gains and hepatic Cu concentrations in experiment one, compared to trout fed fishmeal-based diets. Cu supplementation is required in a plant-based in order to achieve optimal growth in trout. Results of the second study indicate rainbow trout fed plant-based diets require Zn supplementation to obtain sufficient growth. The highest levels of Zn supplementation did not impair Cu uptake in rainbow trout.

One such reaction, named the Tsuji-Trost allylation, is a palladium-catalyzed substitution with the overall transformation being the replacement of an allylic leaving group with a nucleophile. First observed in 1965 with the allylation of diethyl malonate [1], and in 1973 made asymmetric with the use of chiral phosphine ligands by B. M. Trost [2], the reaction has been studied and utilized extensively over the years. While there have been many examples of this reaction in the literature, few explore functionalizing the allylic electrophile. Functionalizing the ""2"" position of an allylic acetate or carbonate could prove to be a useful synthetic tool. Allylic acetates, chlorides and carbonates bearing a methoxymethyl group at this middle position were synthesized. beta-carbonyl ketones which work well under the Tsuji-Trost conditions were also synthesized. Phosphine ligands that provided enantiomeric excess with a variety of nucleophiles in allylic alkylations were used. Upon reaction with a palladium (0) source, the pro-nucleophiles were successfully alkylated in a stereospecific manner. The work described herein investigates modification of the Tsuji-Trost allylation in which oxy-allylation is carried out with a high yield and high degree of enantioselectivity."

Surface-associated microbes have been shown to dominate diversity and activity in the environment, however molecular analysis of sediment-associated communities is hindered by both inaccessibility to the subsurface and co-extraction of inhibitory compounds. In order to analyze microbial communities in which the environmental conditions previously had precluded the use of traditional sediment extraction techniques, biofilm coupons (metal, mesh cylinders containing surrogate substrata) were used to recover microorganisms able to attach and compete in a biofilm. The community recovered from the contaminated site using hematite as a surrogate substratum was dominated by microbes most closely related to Alcaligenes sp. (metal-tolerant), Frateuria sp. (acidophilic), and Methylobacterium radiotolerans (radionuclide-tolerant) which together reflect the acidic, metal-, and radionuclide-contaminated environment. Hematite, as compared to other substrata, was shown to recover communities most closely representative of sediment communities inhabiting the saturated zone. Surface-associated cells have been shown to express greater activity than suspended populations and mineral-associated sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediate the formation of different secondary minerals as compared to suspended cells. In order to investigate the affect of surface-association on enzyme activity, hydrogenase enzyme activity was compared in hematite-associated and suspended populations of the SRB Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Essex 6. Hydrogenase activity of surface-associated populations was higher than that displayed by suspended cells. Hydrogenase likely affects the pH and pE of the conditions immediately surrounding the cell. The greater rate of activity may be one factor which contributes to the formation of a mineral phase not observed in the presence of suspended populations of this bacterium. In order to determine the portion of cells expressing hydrogenase in the surface-associated populations, in situ reverse-transcription PCR was applied to the hematite-associated cells and all cells were expressing the [NiFe] hydrogenase gene. This thesis demonstrates that environmental conditions of contaminated subsurface environments select for microorganisms able to tolerate or utilize the contaminants. Also, the hydrogenase activity of surface-associated populations is not representative of the suspended cells thus indicating the importance of studying attached populations where enzyme activity likely influences the conditions at the mineral-microbe interface.

Western white-faced ewes were supplemented HIGH (12.5% rumen by-pass protein, 880 IU/kg of supplemental Vitamin E, 176 ppm chelated Zn, and 72.7 mg/kg chlortetracycline) or LOW (7.56% rumen by-pass protein, with no supplemental Vitamin E, chelated Zn, or chlortetracycline) supplements at 0.227 kgÂ·ewe -1Â·d -1 during late gestation. Ewes of different age and body condition scores were individually supplemented for 29 d prior to expected lambing. Thereafter, each ewe was mass fed the appropriate supplement until lambing. In Experiment 3, approximately 600 ewes were group fed HIGH or LOW supplements over 2 yr. Differences in antibody transfer from ewe to lamb were detected in supplemented ewes of different age (P < 0.10); however, lamb production was not different (P > 0.10) for all 3 experiments. To investigate lamb post-weaning management, terminally sired lambs (n = 72) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 backgrounding treatments. Lamb backgrounding treatments were: ad libitum access to 80% alfalfa: 20% barley pellets (PELLET); cool season grass paddock grazing (GRASS); remain with ewe flock on fall dormant range (LATE WEAN); wean for 96 h and returned to ewe flock on dormant range (RANGE). Background treatments were applied for 29 d. Thereafter, lambs were finished on a corn based diet. Lamb BW and ultrasound measurements were taken at weaning, after background treatment, after feedlot step-up and at the conclusion of the finishing period. Pen intake was measured. Lambs backgrounded on PELLET were heavier (P < 0.10) than all other treatments after the backgrounding period and at the end of the feedlot period. Lambs backgrounded on PELLET had the greatest intakes and ADG (P < 0.10) during the feedlot period. At beginning and end of the feedlot period, PELLET and GRASS lambs had larger (P < 0.05) LM areas than RANGE and LATE WEAN treated lambs. Under the condition of the studies, late gestational supplements did not improve ewe productivity and backgrounding treatments on dormant range diminished feedlot productivity.

Secondary considerations included whether or not science notebooks versus commercial worksheets impacted students' scientific practices and communication skills. This study contained two treatment phases. In the first phase, students used commercial textbooks and worksheets in an Earth Science Unit. During the second phase of the study student science notebooks were introduced and replaced the commercial worksheets during a Physical Science Unit. At the beginning and end of both phases of the study, a student pre and post-test were administered in each content area. Throughout both phases, a variety of formative assessments such as lab reports, concept maps, assessment probes, and other assignments were implemented and evaluated. As a result of this study, it was concluded that student science notebooks did improve students' conceptual understandings. Formative and summative assessments indicated use of science notebooks led to quantifiable growth in conceptual understandings, scientific practices, and communications skills.

Snow into the 21st century and find a place for the two cultures of science and art to meet	"In 1959, C.P Snow wrote an essay entitled 'The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution' in which he split the intellectual world into two cultures. The first culture is scientific culture; the second culture, on the other hand, includes literary intellectuals and artists. Snow claimed that these two cultures spoke so disparate a language that communication between the two was virtually non-existent. He believed that the self-imposed barriers between science and art played a major role in society's inability to solve the world's problems. As a result, Snow anticipated the need for a 'third culture' created by curious non-scientists that would narrow this cultural divide. I propose that this third culture can be found in a medium that clearly intersects both art and science--and that medium is film. Film looks towards a variety of disciplines for inspiration and ideas and builds upon various fields in order to communicate a message. This multidisciplinary approach is the key uniting the two seemingly incongruous cultures. More specifically, the specific film medium through which the two cultures can best come together is the genre I have dubbed the ""personal science film."" This genre is a hybrid of the personal essay and the science documentary. This thesis will defend Snow's demand for both a scientifically and artistically literate public, analyze the historical events in which science and art have come together, and ultimately present a way in which Snow's formerly competing cultures can coexist and find common ground. I will discuss the basics of a personal science film, highlighting the many techniques required to reach a broader audience. I will demonstrate how the personal science film can bridge the gap between the artistic and scientific worlds, forming a 'third culture', and thus narrowing the ""cultural divide""."

Logos or ""the word"" has generally been privileged over mythos or pathos, denoting emotion and feeling. This privileging has sometimes been challenged by intellectuals within the Western tradition. D. H. Lawrence was the most vocal and passionate writer to do so in modern times. This text traces the development of rationalism in the Western tradition and Lawrence's resistance to it. It also examines modern theoretical developments and notes their convergence with Lawrence's ideas. It concludes by claiming that the postmodern intellectual climate in the West tends towards a critique of rationalism, much like Lawrence."	['interpretation']

Focused around the core value of permanence --a value which proves to structure other architectural values, this thesis's proposes: permanence value design philosophy. In short permanence value design philosophy refers to a means to grasp and provide conviction towards permanence and the qualities present in the design of architecture that is recognized for attaining a ""timeless"" nature which continues to endure permanently either in its built physical presence or in the reminiscent minds and archived resources of history. The establishment of this philosophy and the objective methodology is put forward to provoke and exemplify the necessity for convicted, innovative, intelligent design approaches for the rehabilitation and future development of the built environment. As a test for the ideology, this thesis provides precedent studies representing past and present examples of highly innovated projects; analyzed as either already of a permanent quality or as executing design intelligence and construction practices in line with achieving permanent quality. As a final test of the ideology, and re-evaluation for the objective methodology, this thesis proposes a program and project design for a new library/learning center extension from the already existing Renne Library located on the campus of Montana State University. The design of a new quasi library/learning center has been chosen as the design problem for testing this methodology because of the current change and redefinition that both of these institutions (traditional libraries and universities) are presently experiencing. As a result of the project design and program development adaptations to the permanence value design methodology have been included, and a focus on four separate objectives have been realized as being critical values for permanent minded design."

In particular, the magnetic properties can be affected by finite-size effects or surface effects. It is this author's belief that surface effects and not finite-size effects play the dominate role. This study is a specific example of how to try to answer this question by looking at different sizes of Co 3O 4 nanoparticles. In order to answer this question as well as better understand this system, different antiferromagnetic Co 3O 4 nanoparticles of 4.35 nm and 6.3 nm in diameter were synthesized. These particles were determined to be relatively uniform and monodispersed. In this study, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction (ED) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) were used to study the physical and electronic structure of the nanoparticles. Alternating Current Magnetic Susceptibility (ACMS) was used to measure the magnetic anisotropy energy density of the different size nanoparticles. It was found that the anisotropy energy density increases with decreasing size, from 1.09 x10 4 J/m 3 for the 6.3 nm particles to 7.53x10 4 J/m 3 for the 4.35 nm particles, consistent with the importance of surface anisotropy with decreasing particle size. Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) was used to measure the Neel temperature and coercive field of the different particles. It was found that the Neel temperature decreases with decreasing size, from 40 K to 15 K, consistent with a simple surface approximation of the finite-size scaling theory, while the coercive field increased with decreasing particle size consistent with a surface model. The main conclusion of this work is that surface effects and not finite-size effects play a major role in the change of the magnetic properties with size in Co 3O 4 nanoparticles. The evidence also suggests that the increase in the anisotropy energy density is due to the creation of a surface anisotropy component normal to the surface of the particles.

Two-component systems generally contain a sensor histidine kinase, which detects an environmental signal and responds by autophosphorylation at a histidine residue using ATP as the phosphate donor. The phosphate group is then transferred to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the second component, the response regulator, which in its activated form responds by stimulating or repressing gene expression or motility, as needed for the physiological responses of the cell. The structural versatility of two-component systems reflects the wide range of signals to which bacteria respond. Despite this versatility, histidine kinases and response regulators show a conserved mechanism of signal transfer. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile organism that can use a variety of nutrient sources and is found in many different environments. It is a human pathogen in nosocomial infections as well as in pulmonary fluid of patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa encodes genes for over 60 two-component regulatory systems. In this review, I discuss the structure and function of two-component systems in bacteria, and conduct a phylogenetic analysis of the P. aerugionsa two-component systems. Finally, I develop a model of the calcium-responsive two-component system of P. aeruginosa, PA2656/PA2657, which is closely related to the magnesium responsive PmrAB and phosphate responsive PhoPQ two-component systems. The results provide insight on how P. aeruginosa is able to detect and respond to changing environmental conditions.

The bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes severe gastritis and gastric ulcers, and infection can increase the risk of stomach cancer. The main mode of transmission is believed to be the oral-oral route, however other routes of transmission such as drinking water have been implicated but have not been proven due to difficulty in culturing this organism. In this dissertation, the environmental transmission of H. pylori was investigated using several approaches. A primary objective of this study was to determine if H. pylori could be detected in an environmental reservoir readily consumed by humans, such as drinking water. H. pylori was detected by PCR but not culture in drinking water and biofilms that were obtained from groundwater and municipal systems. H. pylori contamination was sporadic and not associated with measured environmental factors, such as pH or temperature. Growth curve analysis of laboratory grown H. pylori showed that the cells exhibited a switch from a spiral to coccoid morphology as they aged or were exposed to stressful culture conditions. However, results showed that cell morphology was not indicative of culturability, with spiral forms dominant in early nonculturable samples. Microarray analysis of the transition to a nonculturable state showed that cells under oxygen stress quickly modified their transcriptional activity while the cells exposed to nutrient deprivation had nearly undetectable changes in transcriptional activities. Resuscitation of the stressed cells showed that type of stress and length of exposure affected regrowth of H. pylori. The oxygen stressed cells increased virulence factor transcription while nutrient deprived cells decreased transcription of the same factors. This observation led to the conclusion that oxygen stressed and nutrient deprived cells are metabolically active but react differently to in vitro culture conditions with starved cells likely undergoing nutrient shock. Collectively these data suggest that H. pylori can persist and are metabolically active under stressful conditions posed by the environmental mode of transmission.

Competition between invasive and native species often leads to decreases in native populations. For example, a primary reason for listing the Bliss Rapids snail, Taylorconcha serpenticola as threatened in the Snake River drainage was the perceived impacts of the highly invasive New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Despite federal protection of T. serpenticola and the known presence of P. antipodarum in the Snake River drainage for almost 20 years, almost nothing is known about their ecology and competitive interactions. For this dissertation I conducted both field and laboratory studies to determine niche overlaps, spatial patterns, and some life history characteristics of both species. I compared optimal growth temperatures and estimated temperature tolerances for each species, under laboratory conditions; 2) examined stage (size) class fecundity rates and growth rates; and 3) examined photophobic tendencies of both species. I then explored environmental conditions and spatial patterns of both species in Banbury Springs, a tributary of the Snake River, near Hagerman, Idaho, that may have affected their distribution and abundance using regression tree analysis and geostatistical methods. I then conducted several competition experiments between both species under controlled conditions at Banbury Springs, developed competition coefficients, and related their growth rates and competitive outcomes to periphyton abundance and diversity. Finally, I monitored and then modeled seasonal and yearly population density trends of both species in a section of Banbury Springs, where both coexist, using time series analysis. Results of this study show that that both species have niche overlaps (i.e. temperature overlaps, photophobic tendencies, and somewhat similar habitat requirements) and can compete for limited food resources, but may have just enough niche separation or their occupied habitat is heterogeneous enough for them to coexist, at present. It is possible however that not enough time has elapsed for the effects of competition with P. antipodarum to push T. serpenticola to extinction.

The EA employs mutation, crossover and selection operators inspired by biological evolution. It is commonly applied to find exact or approximate solutions to combinatorial search and optimization problems. This dissertation describes a series of theoretical and experimental studies on a variety of evolutionary algorithms and models of those algorithms. The effects of the crossover and mutation operators are analyzed. Multiple examples of deceptive fitness functions are given where the crossover operator is shown or proven to be detrimental to the speedy optimization of a function. While other research monographs have shown the benefits of crossover on various fitness functions, this is one of the few (or only) doing the inverse. A background literature review is given of both population genetics and evolutionary computation with a focus on results and opinions on the relative merits of crossover and mutation. Next, a family of new fitness functions is introduced and proven to be difficult for crossover to optimize. This is followed by the construction and evaluation of executable theoretical models of EAs in order to explore the effects of parameterized mutation and crossover. These models link the EA to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Dynamical systems analysis is performed on models of EAs to explore their attributes and fixed points. Additional crossover deceptive functions are shown and analyzed to examine the movement of fixed points under changing parameters. Finally, a set of online adaptive parameter experiments with common fitness functions is presented.	['science', 'mathematics', 'dynamics', 'mechanics, analytic']

Its integration into secondary schools and its use with curriculum requires a unique knowledge of its purposeful articulation as it relates to curriculum goals and student outcomes. Therefore, this study will focus on how an educator's decision-making process determines how technology will be integrated within the planning process of secondary educators, and how these decisions may be affected by an educators technological pedagogical content knowledge, otherwise known as TPACK. Qualitative analysis was then used to evaluate a Technology Integration Rationale (TIR) that was produced by members of a rural professional development cohort. Qualitative analysis was also conducted on transcribed face-to-face semistructured interviews. The TIR and the interviews involved a cohort representing a rural school district who attended a professional development course that was facilitated by a University in the Rocky Mountain West. The TIR was then scored using a valid rubric to measure an educator's TPACK score. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were transcribed by hand to gain a sense of an educator's understanding of the TPACK framework as it relates to the purposeful use of technology in lesson decision-making. The study found that ones growing familiarity with the use of a specific technology could affect an educator's self-assessed TPACK score. Once an educator understood how to use a specific technology its familiarity made it transparent or simply just another piece of the curriculum. The study also found that barriers can have a significant effect on an educators' decision making when deciding to use technology, and as a result affects an educator's self-assessed TPACK score. Recommendations for further study include examining how the familiarity or transparent nature of technology can affect curricular decision-making, future professional development regarding the TPACK framework, and educator beliefs or efficacy as it relates to integrating technology.

Forests and forest soils in northern latitudes are important carbon pools because of their potential as sinks for atmospheric carbon. However there are significant unknowns related to the effects of hydrologic variability, mountainous terrain, and landscape heterogeneity in controlling soil carbon dioxide (CO 2) efflux. Mountainous terrain imposes large spatial heterogeneity in the biophysical controls of soil CO 2 production and efflux, including soil temperature, soil water content, vegetation, substrate, and soil physical properties. Strong spatial and temporal variability in biophysical controls can lead to large heterogeneity in the magnitude of soil CO 2 efflux. This dissertation research investigates the relationships between these biophysical controls and the resultant CO 2 efflux across the soil-atmosphere interface in a 393-ha subalpine catchment of the Northern Rocky Mountains. This study incorporates knowledge gained through field observations (2 growing seasons) at multiple locations distributed across the watershed, and a range of empirical analytical techniques including a modeling approach to estimate point to catchment scale soil CO 2 efflux. Variability in soil CO 2 efflux was strongly related to topography and landscape structure. Riparian meadows were found to have the highest rates of cumulative soil CO 2 efflux across the entire watershed, likely due to more accumulation of soil water than upland sites, leading to enhanced plant and microbial respiration in riparian meadows. Landscape context and appreciation of organized heterogeneity are critical to estimation and interpretation of watershed-scale rates of soil CO 2 efflux and for up-scaling plot or point measurements of soil CO 2 efflux to larger spatial scales. This dissertation provides examples and suggestions for corroboration and integration of soil and canopy level CO 2 fluxes and for process understanding of spatiotemporal variability of biogeochemical processes driven by the hydrologic cycle.

They have been used in the development of hundreds of modern cultivars. Semi-dwarf wheat varieties containing these GA-insensitive dwarfing genes generally yield more grain than their tall Rht-B1a and Rht-D1a (formerly rht1 and rht2) counterparts. However, Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b are better adapted to high-input environments and can reduce plant performance under adverse conditions such as heat or drought stress. In such environments, Rht8, a GA-sensitive dwarfing gene, could prove beneficial. This study aimed to assess agronomic performance of Rht8 compared to Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b using near-isogenic lines of the six possible genotypes (Rht-B1b, Rht-B1a, Rht-D1b, Rht-D1a, Rht8, and rht8) in four different spring wheat backgrounds. Field trials were conducted during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons in Bozeman and Kalispell, MT. Traits measured included plant height, coleoptile length, stem solidness, days to heading, yield, flag leaf characteristics, harvest index, and others. Measurements were taken from field trials except coleoptile length, which was grown in a temperature and light controlled growth chamber. Rht genotype had a significant effect on plant height, coleoptile length, and yield. Height reductions of 20.5%, 22.4%, and 10.1% were observed for Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, and Rht8, respectively. Rht8 showed no significant effect on coleoptile length, while Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b exhibited reductions in coleoptile length of 21.3% and 22.8%. Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b both showed a 6.1% and 14.1%. increase in yield potential. In contrast, Rht8 showed a yield decrease of 5.3%. Of most interest to plant breeders are those traits that effect yield. Yield is a complex, multi-genic trait that is affected by many plant characteristics and environmental factors. Because of the quantitative nature of yield, it is impacted by not only the presence of dwarfing genes, but also genetic background and environmental variables. This study suggests that Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b are superior, in terms of yield potential, to Rht8. However, additional evaluation of Rht8 in differing environments is needed to elucidate its precise effects on yield and other agronomic traits.

Despite growing scientific understanding of wildfire over the past 100 years, science and natural history films repeatedly position wildfire merely to achieve dramatic effect. These films typically ignore the available science and in many cases contradict scientific truth outright for the sake of the dramatic narrative. Formulaic conventions developed by Walt Disney and various societal convictions are responsible for the perpetuation of old narrative devices that condemn fire. Science and natural history films reach tens of millions of people each year and shape public opinion of forest fires. These films have perpetuated the myth of Eden, the damning of wildfire, and the valorization of total fire suppression, all of which have had social, political, and economic ramifications. To help align public perception of fire with the current scientific understanding of fire, producers of science and natural history films must redirect their narrative devices that traditionally demonize fire to create a new Eden, one borne of fire. Disturbance represents a new model for the portrayal of wildfire in science and natural history films by employing drama to advance an appreciation of burned forests while avoiding narrative pitfalls that traditionally condemn fire. By combining observational and expository filmmaking modes, Disturbance also offers a new model for conservation-based science and natural history films, a model that incorporates society into nature and conservation into society.

In essence, the old adage ""first impressions count"" is true in learning as well. Although there is research to show that this phenomena, known as the primacy effect, or serial position effect, is pronounced in remembering lists of simple symbols; i.e. letters or numbers, the purpose of this study was to see its effect in longer lessons focused on very specific parts of the scientific method. I used the primacy effect to test how effective it was in increasing student performance in variable identification similar to our state's standardized science test. The results showed that the students who received instruction about variable identification at the beginning of class consistently outperformed those who got that instruction at other times of the lesson. The implications of this study are that the learning cycle of instruction, practice, assessment can be highly effective in practicing specific skills in a science classroom. Furthermore, in a classroom where lessons are broken into short, developmentally appropriate blocks of time, instruction toward an overreaching concept can be effectively taught at the beginning of a lesson."

69560	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2149	Application of proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry to measure hydrocarbon emissions in engine exhaust	Megacities around the world face air quality problems due to exhaust emissions from large vehicle fleets. Chemical reactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOC) from automobile exhaust are known to produce ground level ozone which poses a threat to human health and plant life. Additionally, some of these organic compounds are known carcinogens. While the dangers of VOC are well known, their production from in use vehicles and aircraft are relatively poorly understood. This dissertation will describe how a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) was altered to make the first on-road, speciated VOC measurements of its kind and how the response of the instrument in such a complex sample matrix was interpreted. The developed experimental technique was then used to observe aircraft exhaust plumes from in-use commercial aircraft, and to further characterize aircraft exhaust in a ground based experiment. PTR-MS was an appropriate technique for these measurements due to its ability to perform rapid, quantitative measurements. A commercial PTR-MS instrument was modified to operate in a mobile laboratory with capabilities of sampling and analyzing intercepted air in real-time. Automobile and aircraft exhaust are both complex mixtures of VOC which produce complicated ion responses in the PTR-MS. Accurate quantification of a number of important VOC is demonstrated through a series of thorough intercomparison studies to other measurement techniques such as Gas Chromotography Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID), Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) and Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). A calibration method was developed to increase quantification accuracy for some important compounds observed in exhaust in this study. The interpretation of the PTR-MS response to each exhaust type is now well understood. Once the PTR-MS response was validated by comparison to other techniques, the results from the measurement campaigns provided the basis of several papers extending the understanding of exhaust compositions. Among these results, emission inventories of several compounds were determined for various classes of vehicles and for aircraft. These emission inventories can be used in models to predict the impact of these emissions on local air quality. Additional results from these studies are also presented in this dissertation.

This research investigated replacing 100 percent of the Portland cement and natural aggregates in structural grade concrete with self-cementing fly ashes (by-products of coal fired power plants) and pulverized glass (post-consumer glass from the container industry). Researchers at Montana State University identified 95 fly ashes from a screening of over 491 U.S. power plants that are potentially capable of replacing 100 percent of the Portland cement in conventional concrete. Samples were obtained for 15 of these ashes from which fly ash/glass concretes were made to evaluate their performance. Of these 15 fly ashes, 8 produced concretes with 28-day compression strengths of at least 3,000 psi, making these concretes potentially viable for standard construction applications. Two of these five ashes (from Wyoming and Kansas) were then used in scaled up bulk mixes to determine the mechanical properties (compressive and tensile strength, elastic modulus) and durability (ASR, abrasion, chloride permeability) of these ""green"" concretes. They exhibited satisfactory performance with some variances from the behavior of conventional concretes, while maintaining controllable set times and adequate workability. Reinforced concrete beams were further made with fly ash/glass concretes produced with the Wyoming and Kansas ashes, and then tested alongside those made with a previously studied Montana ash as well as with traditional Portland cement concrete. Three different reinforcing schemes were used with each of the four concretes to highlight separate failure mechanisms: yielding of the reinforcement, crushing of the concrete, and concrete beam shear. The failure behaviors were generally the same for elements with the same reinforcing scheme, independent of the concrete used. Some differences were seen, however, in the ultimate capacities of the fly ash/glass and traditional beams. Additionally, ultimate capacities predicted with the American Concrete Institute building code (ACI 318-08) were typically conservative compared to the measured capacities of the fly ash/glass beams (in the most unconservative case, the capacity was over predicted by only seven percent)."

This group's research ranges from modeling underground sequestration wells to detection of leaks at test sites. One of these test sites is located just west of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT, at 45.66Â°N 111.08Â°W. At this site experiments were conducted to assess the viability of using multispectral imaging to detect plant stress as a surrogate for detecting a CO2 leak. A Geospatial Systems MS3100 multispectral imager, implemented in color-infrared mode, was used to image the plants in three spectral bands. Radiometric calibration of the output of the imager, a digital number (DN), to a reflectance was achieved using a grey card and spectralon reflectance panels. To analyze plant stress we used time series comparisons of the bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), computed from the red and near-infrared band reflectances. Results were compared with rainfall, soil moisture, and CO2 flux data. The experiment was repeated two years in a row; the first from June 21, 2007 to August 1, 2007 and the second from June 16, 2008 to August 22, 2008. Data from the first experiment showed that plants directly over the leak were negatively affected quickly, while plants far from the pipe were affected positively. Data from the second experiment showed that the net effect of leaking CO2 depends on the relationship between CO2 sink-source balance and vegetation density. Also, due to the strong calibration techniques employed in 2008, the imaging system was able to see the effects of water and hail on the vegetation. We have also found a way to image continuously through the day, not having to worry about clouds or sun-to-scene/scene-to-imager angle effects. This system's easy setup, automation, all-day imaging capability, and possibility for low cost makes it a very practical tool for plant stress measurements for the purpose of detecting leaking CO2.

Maximizing the potential of targeted grazing requires a method to determine the botanical composition of individual diets of grazing animals over time Fecal near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to estimate the botanical composition of sheep consuming, leafy spurge, mountain big sage brush, and juniper, but has not been used to estimate dietary composition of sheep consuming spotted knapweed. Fecal NIRS spectra collected from three feeding trials were used to develop modified partial least squares regression equations to predict percent spotted knapweed in sheep diets. Independent validation of individualy developed equations resulted in RÂ² values of .22 - .72. An equation developed by combining data from all three trials resulted in acceptable levels of precision (RÂ²= .96) and was used to analyze data collected from range fecal sampling trials conducted in 2006. Two fecal sampling trials were conducted in 2006 to determine NIR's ability to detect differences in dietary composition of sheep grazing spotted knapweed infested range over time. Approximately 90 fecal samples were collected on July 13 and again on August 15 from a band of 900 ewes grazing spotted knapweed infested range to determine changes in diet over time. Fecal samples from five randomly selected ewes in the same band were collected weekly (June 22 - August 17) to detect variation in indiviudal intake over time On July 13, 55% of ewes from had 0-5% spotted knapweed in their diets while 44% had 5-20% spotted knapweed in their diets. On August 15, 1% of ewes, had <10% spotted knapweed in their diets and 44% had 20-25% spotted knapweed in their diets. With the exception of July 6, individual intake of spotted knapweed was similar (P > .05) from June 22, through July 20, but was greater (P > .05)from July 27 through August 17 than from June 22 through July 20. These results suggest that the appropriate time to apply grazing for spotted knapweed control is later in the growing season when sheep are including more of the target plant in their diet.

Initially as a classroom teacher in a nearby town, I observed first-hand the positive impact of experiences had by my students at KSS on their attitudes toward learning science. This research was designed as a descriptive study to analyze how KSS uses outdoor methods and strategies to positively effect student attitudes toward learning science. Over the course of several weeks, participating students and teachers were surveyed about their experiences (typically 3-day/2-night) at Keystone Science School. Instructors and field groups were also observed on several occasions to analyze the degree to which particular methods and strategies were being employed, and their effectiveness on student interest and engagement in science. The results suggest that with an overwhelming positive view from students and teachers about the effectiveness of their outdoor learning experiences, student age, student gender, and instructor gender had some effect on these attitudes. Boys tended to be slightly more comfortable learning outdoors than girls, and younger students (ages 9-11) generally more comfortable than older students (ages 12-14) especially among girls. Students also reported being slightly more comfortable learning outdoors with male instructors, and tended to rate the abilities of male instructors slightly higher. The findings of this result support the conclusion that methods and strategies used in outdoor education are more effective at developing positive attitudes toward learning science than typical classroom experiences.

Geographical isolation, lack of access to mental health care, a shortage of mental health prescribers, and stigma contribute significantly to mental health disparities. Access to mental health care has proven to be a significant barrier for many people including those living in rural areas, the incarcerated, military personnel, the homeless, the elderly, or individuals with health related issues affecting their mobility (Anthony, Mertz Nagel, & Goss, 2010). Telepsychiatry in health care is an emerging technology that offers the potential to reduce these service disparities. This literature review was organized and presented according to the methodology recommendations of Whittemore and Knafl (2005). Components of the research paper included are a presentation of the problem, literature review, a description of data analysis methods, presentation of findings, and discussion and summary. Seventeen primary research articles were evaluated comparing clinical outcomes using telepsychiatry to a more traditional, face-to-face method of intervention. Telepsychiatry in health care has been proven to reduce mental health disparities for the rural and underserved populations by increasing access to mental health care, but research regarding the effectiveness of this technology has been limited. Demonstrated effectiveness of telepsychiatry must be established if the goal of widespread implementation is to be realized.

The existence of unconscious thought as a decision-making process is controversial. In fact, it has been suggested that unconscious thought is not a process rather the evidence supporting it is the result of a methodological artifact (Lassiter et al., in press) that only occurs when participants can retrieve online judgments. This thesis attempts to resolve this controversy. Participants received information describing 4 cars (acquisition stage) that were described by twelve dichotomous attributes (e.g., good/poor mileage). The best car possessed mostly positive characteristics and the worst car had mostly negative characteristics. Participants were told before or after the information was presented, that they would be forming an impression of the four cars. They were then allowed to think about the cars consciously for 4 minutes, were distracted for 4 minutes (unconscious thought), or were asked to make an immediate decision without thinking. When the instructions to form an impression were received before acquiring the information, the participants could form online judgments during acquisition. These could later be retrieved when participants reported their attitudes. When the instructions to form an impression were received after participants acquired the information, they could not form online judgments, but could form only memory-based judgments after the information was presented. Without online judgments, participants are forced to rely on memory-based judgments. Thus, if participants in the unconscious-thought condition formed more favorable attitudes toward the best car relative to the attitudes formed by the participants in the other two conditions, a thought process must be occurring. Additionally, these attitudes should transfer to choosing the best car as well. However, the results of this thesis failed to replicate previous research (Lassiter et al., in press) as the dependent measures failed to reach significance.

Reasons for different reporting structures and athletics director satisfaction with reporting structures were studied, and athletics directors' perceptions of their structures, particularly when organizational change had recently occurred, were analyzed. Athletics directors at all 977 NCAA Division I, II and III institutions were asked to complete a questionnaire indicating to whom they report in the administrative structure of their institution, what organizational structure changes had occurred during the previous five year period, and their satisfaction level with their campus reporting structure. Fifteen NCAA athletics directors were asked in a telephone interview to respond to questions about their current and previous organizational structures. Results were cross tabulated and frequencies were calculated. A content analysis of themes from the written survey and telephone interview was conducted. The two most common administrative reporting structures were a direct report to the university president and to the student affairs division. A direct report to the president was the most common in Divisions I-A, I-AA, I-AAA and II, whereas student affairs was the most common structure in Division III. The vast majority of athletics directors were satisfied with their reporting structure. Those reporting directly to the president cited the direct contact with the president as the primary reason for their satisfaction. Athletics directors who reported to student affairs indicated the natural fit with student services was the primary reason for their structure. Satisfaction levels generally decreased when moving from larger to smaller athletics programs. Athletics directors, particularly in Division I, felt that it was critical to report directly to the university president due to the high visibility of their programs, NCAA institutional control issues, and the impact of the athletics program on the institution as a whole. Respondents also indicated that communication efficiency necessitated this direct involvement. Directors of lower division athletics programs were generally satisfied reporting through student affairs. However, among these directors there were some who expressed interest in a direct report to the president.

A series of tetramethyl rhodamine derivatives were developed to study the effects of substitution patterns on the photophysical properties of the fluorophores. After identifying the superior fluorophore a zwitterionic side chain with properties beneficial for two dimensional applications was coupled to the fluorophore and the photophysical properties were studied. Iridium(III) cationic fluorophores are interesting synthetic targets due to their ultraviolet absorption wavelengths and visible emission properties. A series of Iridium(III) fluorophores, some of which contain a handle for further synthetic extension, has been made to study the ligand effects on the emission properties of the dyes. Finally, some of these dyes have been synthetically modified for proteomic labeling applications.

A total of 525 aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 1,703 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees were cored and 10,168 seedlings were counted at five sites along the ecotone in the Centennial Valley. A total of 2,968 Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) were cored and 4,709 seedlings were counted at five ecotones in the Darhad Valley. Tree-age distribution was constructed to determine 20th Century tree establishment. Tree age and location within the ecotone were correlated to describe the process of ecotone shift into the adjacent grassland. To examine livestock herbivory effects on ecotone shift, the number of new trees was correlated with ten different levels of cattle grazing intensity during the last 60 years in the Centennial Valley and with five different grazing regimes during the last 80 years in the Darhad Valley. Three different types of ecotone shift into the adjacent grassland were documented: forest boundary shift, densification, and fairy ring establishment. No evidence of ecotone shift upslope towards the forest was found. Grazing intensity had a complex relationship with tree encroachment. Aspen and Douglas-fir tree encroachment was low at medium levels of grazing intensity, but aspen establishment was higher at low and high grazing levels and Douglas-fir establishment was higher at low grazing levels. Siberian larch tree encroachment was higher at low and high grazing intensities by sheep and cattle, but it was lower at low and medium grazing levels by goat-sheep and goatsheep- cattle mixes. My results implied that grazing can both facilitate and inhibit tree encroachment. I propose a model of grazing effects on tree encroachment that integrates both inhibition and facilitation effects of grazing disturbance. I also propose a conceptual model of lower forest-grassland ecotone shift and a conceptual model of ecotone shift and livestock herbivory effects. My models suggest that grazing can be used as a tool to maintain the equilibrium between forest and grassland vegetation and to increase or decrease forest expansion.

The models used publicly available Landsat TM 5, USGS DEM, and soil survey-derived data as predictor variables. The goal of the project was to test whether ranchers could collect a limited size soil water content data set, build sitespecific regression models based on the data set, and construct soil water content maps based on the models. The response variable for models consisted of 100 and 82 average soil profile mass water content samples for each ranch, respectively. Half the samples were used for model calibration and half for model validation. Multiple regression models had calibration R2 of 0.64 and 0.43 for each ranch, respectively. Validation showed that the multiple regression models predicted the validation data sets with average error (RMSD) within 0.04 mass water content and regression tree models predicted within 0.055 mass water content. The majority of the validation MSD for all models was accounted for by a lack of correlation between predicted and observed values along a 1:1 line. Models were then constructed with decreased sample sizes. Regression tree models and multiple regression models constructed with 20 to 30 samples predicted soil water content with similar, though still limited, accuracy and precision to full sample models. Site-specific field and lab soil characterization data developed with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy modeling was used to assess the suitability of the soil survey based predictor variables. The multiple regression models with the site-specific data predicted soil water content with average prediction errors (RMSD) of 0.035 and 0.036 mass water content for the two ranches, respectively. Soil survey model predictions were statistically significantly different than site-specific model predictions for one ranch but not the other. Especially dry conditions were a factor contributing to the difficulty in accurately modeling and predicting soil water content encountered at both study sites. Landsat imagery from the peak of the previous growing season, DEM-derived slope and aspect variables, and soil survey attribute data each showed promise as significant predictors of spring soil water content, particularly considering the dry conditions of the data collection period.

Laboratory experiments have been used by science educators for over two centuries. This is primarily due to the fact that laboratory experiments play a fundamental role in the education of a science student. Laboratory experiments help students learn science concepts in straight forward hands on ways. They expose students to methods and skills and use practical means to elucidate science concepts. Science educators face several hurdles in making the laboratory experiment a useful educational tool. The first and most obvious issue is picking an experiment which will allow students to master science content. Creating the perfect experiment to instruct students can be a daunting task. That being said there are many 'classic' labs which educators have used over the years which often fit the bill. After using the correct experiment science educators are then challenged to accurately assess their student's performance. More often than not this means using a standard type written lab report. This is the same old tried and true document that we have all created. It is usually based on a rubric and is normally written well after the experiment itself, well after the particulars are perhaps forgotten. My action research project measured the effectiveness of a typewritten lab report against a well structured science notebook as an assessment tool. A series of laboratory experiments was used to measure the usefulness of the two assessment strategies. Forty two students from New Fairfield High School participated in the study. Attitude surveys, post lab quizzes, exit tickets and several interviews were conducted and the results compared. The results indicated that both assessment tools allowed students to master science content. The results suggested that the students did enjoyed using a science notebook because it allowed them to organize their ideas. Based upon the results of this project it is my intention to assess lab reports in the future using a combination of both approaches.

However, there is little research which investigates the types of mentoring support these programs provide and the effectiveness of this support (SREB, 2007). This mixed methods study was undertaken to determine the frequency of mentoring support that high school and assistant principals in Montana's AA, A and B schools experienced during their beginning years as building administrations. In addition, this study also investigated principals' perceptions of the main sources of mentoring support and to describe the support strategies that principals used in the absence of mentoring. One hundred and twenty-two high school principals and assistant principals were sent the School Administration and Leaderships Skills Inventory (SALSS) (Stout, 2001) and asked to rate their perceptions of mentoring support during their novice years as building administrators. Results from this research found that when averaged across the ISLLC Leadership Skill domains, 95% of lead principals and assistant principals indicated that mentoring support would have been beneficial during their induction years as building administrators. Follow-up interviews were conducted with five principals were to more fully understand the sources of administrative support that were available to the support strategies that they used in the absence of mentoring. Results from semistructured interviews identified, ""Supportive Peer Administrators"", ""Personality Traits"", ""Self-Development"" and ""Experience"" as themes that described principals' sources of administrative support. ""Creating Supportive Relationships"", ""Reflection"", and ""Supportive Peer Administrators"" were the themes that principals collectively used to describe the support strategies they used in the absence of formal or informal mentoring. Results from this study suggest that there is a lack of mentoring support networks novice high school principals practicing in the state of Montana. Findings from this research suggest that Montana's school districts and the university principal preparation programs need to make a concerted effort to establish formal mentoring programs for new school administrators. It is recommended that these organizations work collaboratively to mentoring support networks for novice principals and to use the findings from this study to guide those efforts."

The complex dynamic ecosystems in the NR provide outstanding field laboratories for long-term scientific investigations to evaluate management techniques. Grassland and shrubland ecosystems serve as important habitat for a wide variety of animal species in the NR and empirical knowledge of these systems enables managers to better understand the ecological complexities and make informed management decisions. Accurate vegetation maps are useful tools for these land managers, as is the ability to detect changes in vegetation over time. An inexpensive and easily reproducible method for mapping rangelands over the NR was developed utilizing Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery. A classification hierarchy of non-forest vegetation was produced with 5 levels, ranging from very broad vegetation types such as woodland, shrubland, or herbaceous vegetation (Level 1) to specific vegetation types such as aspen (Populus tremuloides), tufted hairgrass/sedge (Deschampsia cespitosa/Carex spp.), or big sagebrush/Idaho fescue (Artemisia tridentata/Festuca idahoensis) (Level 5). A 1999 base map of nonforest vegetation in the NR was created using classification tree analysis (CTA) combined with boosting. Overall accuracies of the final maps ranged from 72.30% for Level 5 to 83.65% for Level 1, providing evidence that this method can be successful for mapping non-forest vegetation in the NR. A 1985 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite image was chosen for performing a change detection analysis from 1985 to 1999. Tasseled Cap space was utilized to choose a threshold of change in a change vector analysis (CVA). Areas of no change in the 1999 image were used to train areas of potential change on the 1985 image to produce a final map of the NR for 1985. Overall accuracies of the final maps ranged from 72.60% for Level 5 to 88.73% for Level 1. Managers are able to analyze this change information and modify their management techniques as needed. With the 1999 base map the CVA method enables managers to detect vegetation change in the NR on a regular basis.	['organisms', 'life (biology)', 'plants']

Much of this cross-national variation in economic performance may be explained by the interaction between natural resources and institutional quality. Focusing on the importance of economic institutions in the form of property rights and the rule of law this paper presents an alternative explanation for the diverging economic paths in resource rich nations. Economic rents generated from abundant oil and gas resources may affect institutions or institutional quality. Further, that impact on institutions is itself contingent upon the quality of such institutions during the payoff period of the resource windfalls. The findings suggest that resource wealth has a positive influence on the strength of property rights and the rule of law (and thus, by inference on economic growth) in the nations that start out with strong protection of property rights and associated rule of law, but a negative influence in nations that do not. The results appear robust to alternative specifications of the resource variable.	['natural resources']

For example, as students work through daily laboratory experiments and class work, I consistently sense boredom in my high-achieving students alongside of confusion in my low-achieving students. The goal of this project was to better meet my students' diverse learning needs. This project took place in two sixth-grade general science classes at a large international school in Hong Kong, China. It focused on how implementing differentiated instruction, which is instruction designed with student differences in mind, such as students' background knowledge, instructional level, interests, and learning styles, affected students' understanding of introductory chemistry concepts. Lessons implementing four differentiation methods of scaffolding, alternative learning products, tiered homework assignments, and graphic organizers were compared to traditional lessons where all students completed the same assignments and demonstrated their learning in the same format. Data revealing students' understanding of concepts were collected through pre and postunit assessments, writings, and interviews, which included concept mapping and conceptual questions. Data regarding effects on my own attitude, planning time, and motivation were also collected through writings, surveys, and a time log. The project's results indicated that differentiated instruction did not have a positive effect on my students' overall understanding of concepts or cognitive level of understanding. Neither did the differentiated instruction have a positive effect on the understanding of my high, middle, or low-achieving students. My attitude, planning, and motivation yielded both positive and negative results.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

Due to a lack of studies examining the environmental fate of ULV insecticides and because previous risk assessments have shown that environmental concentrations of insecticides contributed the largest amount of variance to the estimated total exposure, I measured deposition onto surfaces and air concentrations of permethrin and naled. I also conducted risk assessments for human and other non-target organisms using the values I measured. Deposition concentrations of permethrin and naled generally decreased as distance from the spray source increased. Overall, approximately 3.2% of the permethrin and 15% of the naled applied deposited on the ground within 75 m from the spray source 1 h after application. Concentrations of permethrin and naled 12 h after application were not significantly different than concentrations 1 h after application. The results of my probabilistic human-health risk assessment using actual environmental concentrations showed that previous risk assessments overestimated risks. Thus they were conservative in protecting human health. The non-target risk assessment and field bioassay using the house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.), as a surrogate for medium- to large-bodied ground dwelling insects showed that ULV applications most likely would not result in impacts on populations. I also measured actual environmental concentrations of pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) after aerial ULV applications. Pyrethrins were not detected in the water or on deposition pads. However PBO was detected in the water and on deposition samples, but concentrations rapidly decreased to background levels by 36 h after application. The estimated risks of pyrethrins and PBO to aquatic surrogates were lower than those estimated by previous ecological risk assessments. My study is the first to relate actual environmental concentrations of ULV insecticides to estimates of human-health risks. Results of my environmental fate studies, human-health and non-target risk assessments, and the current weight of scientific evidence, demonstrate that the risks to humans and the environment after ULV applications of insecticides most likely are below regulatory levels of concern.

A better understanding of the basic behavior of protein-carbohydrate interactions is critical for controlling cellular proliferation and recognition processes for novel therapeutic methods to be successful. Many procedures that exist for evaluating protein-carbohydrate interactions are often limited to monovalent interactions or small polymers. Given that many cellular processes, such as those attributed to the immune system, are enhanced multivalently or are aggregation-driven, there is a need to reveal the behavior and basic requirements for multivalent binding and aggregation. Evaluating these interactions on large, multivalent scaffolds such as synthetically controllable dendrimers provides an important tool towards accurately determining the role of glycosylation in biological systems. Here, different approaches to measure the interactions of proteins with glycodendrimers are described, ranging from simple qualitative assays to novel quantitative methods of assessment. Quantitative methods such as Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and Surface Plasmon Resonance are severely limited when used with multivalent systems, and do not provide as accurate results as monovalent systems. When dealing with multivalent systems, inhibition assays often provide more reproducible results. Through these experiments, it has become increasingly apparent that aggregates play a significant role in multivalent systems, and current methods to evaluate these interactions leave much room for improvement. Assay design is important both for basic identification and understanding of any interaction, especially higher-order interactions involving multivalency. Endgroup patterning and presentation was explored to determine their role in multivalent affinity enhancements. Using a novel fluorescence lifetime method, glycodendrimer-mediated aggregation was successfully characterized. The work here evaluates the effectiveness of assays used for carbohydrate interaction, translated to a multivalent scaffold, with special consideration to large-order aggregates.

A common method aimed at improving plant yield has been to modify enzymes important to storage compound biosynthesis in sink tissues such as seeds. As the rate limiting step in starch biosynthesis, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) has received much attention in this regard. Previously, overexpression of AGPase in seeds resulted in an enhanced yield phenotype in which both plant yield and biomass were increased. However, yield advantages were only observed under nonlimiting environmental resources. The objective of these studies was to 1) determine the importance of native leaf starch levels to the productivity and growth of maize and 2) target source strength by overexpressing AGPase in rice leaves. To determine the importance of native leaf starch levels in maize, field trials of BC 4F 2:3 plants segregating for the presence or absence of the agps-m1 mutation and leaf starch were conducted in Citra, Florida. The results clearly demonstrate the importance of normal leaf starch levels to maize productivity. The starchless agps-m1 plants were 6 to 13 cm shorter, flowered 2 to 3 days later, and had 30 percent lower seed yield than their wild type sisterlines. The impact of increased AGPase in rice leaves was then tested by overexpressing AGPase in rice leaves. Two expression constructs were used to transform rice cultivar Nipponbare, each containing a modified form of the maize endosperm AGPase large subunit sequence, Sh2r6hs, as well as the small subunit sequence, Bt2. Expression of the transgenes was under control of either the rice leaf AGPase small subunit promoter, Ags1, or native rice RuBisCO small subunit promoter, RBC. Expression of the transgenes under the RBC promoter is associated with significantly increased plant biomass. Our results indicate that it is possible to increase plant yield without increasing the rate of photosynthesis. Further, it indicates the possibility of manipulating plant yield through increasing AGPase activity in leaf tissue.

Research about training for trustees indicates that training can enhance board effectiveness, but little is known about board members' predisposition to training. While there is research based consensus about training needs for school board members, little is known about trustees' predisposition and how that temperament impacts in-service. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring these topics with selected participants. There is a lack of research-based knowledge about perceptions regarding training and development for Montana public school board trustees. The purpose of this research was to gather data from Montana public school trustees and superintendents regarding perceptions of training for school board members. Preferred methods of delivery for training and development, as well as who should be the primary instructor for training school board trustees was also examined. Utilizing Key Work for School Boards as the standard for knowledge and performance for school trustees and working through a learning model framework entitled the Learning Stages Model that characterizes dispositions towards training, this research provides data about the continuum of learning for school board trustees. In addition to assisting superintendents and school boards, this research educates and informs advocacy groups, professional associations, universities, and the public regarding training and development for school trustees. Trustees in the study generally judged themselves ill-prepared to serve and believed that being a parent was their best prior preparation for school board service. Trustees in the study looked to the board chair versus the superintendent to provide training. Trustee and superintendent participants preferred locally developed and delivered training in part because of time constraints. While training was perceived to be important, most trustees did not progress through a learning continuum of incompetent to competent. Overall, even though trustees were deficient in the skill and knowledge standards developed by the National School Boards Association, they were not seeking training to become proficient to be able to fully understand the job they have been elected to do.

The ability to recognize and regulate that process is advantageous in that it gives students the expertise to direct their own learning. Such metacognitive ability can be developed through the use of direct lessons in questioning techniques and subsequent reinforcement through the use of both oral question-and-answer discussions and written questions, as well as oral and written responses. Thus, a series of lessons were conducted in order to instruct seventh grade students in the identification of types of questions, relevant signal words, and a rubric for coding depth and complexity of questions. It was hypothesized that the lessons in question strategies would result in higher level questions posed and answers given as well as higher summative assessment scores and an increase in student confidence in science class. The rubric was used to codify questions and answers collected through a variety of means. Specifically, prior to and following the intervention, students used anonymous exit slips to ask questions about content; coding showed that students asked higher level questions after being taught question strategies. Oral questions, culled from transcriptions of audio-recorded classroom discussion, also showed higher level questioning in the post-intervention unit. Answers transcribed and coded from audio-recordings did not show much improvement, but written reflective answers did show higher level responses from pre- to post-intervention units. Summative test scores weakly supported the study's objective in that scores improved from 2011 to 2012 seventh grade classes, and there was considerable improvement in performance on one question targeted at a misconception problem. Finally, students did show a confidence increase from the pre- to post-treatment units as assessed by means of a Likert-type survey and interviews.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

Architecture could become the medium to create that connection as well as the physical manifestation of our understanding of existence and of time, which facilitates this connection. This thesis seeks an understanding of self and place through our sensory connection to nature. In our modern world, we are presented with a growing amount of synthetic and manufactured surroundings that are designed to be perceived through sight, while sound, smell, taste and touch are considered secondary senses, and experiential quality is not inherent. Our society is moving farther away from a connection to nature and a connection to the earth. I believe that through sensory connection to our natural surroundings we will reinvigorate a deeper connection with ourselves and to the environment. This thesis is exploring how nature is the medium for a deeper connection and understanding of ourselves, who we are, and how we interact with the environment through sensory perception. Natural materials and practices are being replaced with synthetics, which lack the cyclical nature and life of natural materials. Machine-made products lack the ability to connect on a humanistic level due to their perpetual state of youth. ""We are increasingly detaching ourselves from 'organic and functional periodicity' which is dictated by nature, and replacing it by 'mechanical periodicity' which is dictated by the schedule, the calendar, and the clock.""Â³ These fabricated objects intensify the isolated state of man from the natural world through their constant neglect of the senses and disregard for the energies intrinsic in natural materials. It is my belief that to be able to live meaningful and impassioned lives, we must become more aware of fabricated surroundings, and return to natural environment from which we came. By refocusing on natural processes and materials in the built environment, man can reawaken the relationship we have with nature. I believe that through understanding our surrounding's impact, we can connect with not only ourselves, but the environment."	['philosophy, modern', 'phenomenology']

In these porous media regions, microbes can have both desirable and undesirable effects on the hydrodynamics and fluid chemistry by inducing the formation of microbial aggregates, which can include extracellular polymeric substance and abiotic particles such as mineral precipitates. While not the focus of this research, these analyses are likewise applicable to biomatter control scenarios in filtration systems and other industrial reactors with a high surface area to volume ratio. Microbially-induced ureolytic calcium carbonate precipitation has been suggested as a means to mitigate leakage from geologic CO 2 sequestration sites and as a means to immobilize divalent contaminants such as strontium-90 in remediation scenarios. In this process, microbes hydrolyze urea, increasing the solution pH, generating carbonate ions, and ultimately shifting the saturation state of the fluid and leading to solid calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) formation in a calcium-rich environment. Experiments were conducted to assess the distribution and effects of biofouling and biomineralization in two-dimensional flat plate reactors with 1mm pore spaces simulating a tortuous porous media environment. In biomineralization experiments, calcium carbonate was formed under flow conditions, and strontium was effectively immobilized within the crystal lattice, suggesting the applicability of subsurface biotechnical applications utilizing this technology. Image, residence time distribution, and piezometer analyses of biofouling experiments quantified porosity and hydraulic conductivity reductions. Biofilms were grown under constant flow and head conditions and were shown to be more channeled and evenly distributed along the flow path in constant flow conditions. Biofilms were challenged with chlorinated bleach, which temporarily increased the hydraulic conductivity, yet failed to remove significant biofouling unless coupled with significant fluid shear. In situ methods utilizing stereo and confocal microscopy were developed to visualize and quantify the distribution of biomatter formation and analyze the biological environment at the surface of bio-induced minerals.

Traditionally rural, Montana is experiencing significant growth in its urban and destination areas. With growth comes obstacles and opportunities. The majority of the state is sufficiently connected to the global transportation network for the movement of goods, but lacks diverse people moving systems. While goods have the benefit of being transported at high speeds via road, rail, and air, the majority of people do not. Roadways near urban areas are frequent victims of congestion, the vitality of many airports is in question, and rail is minimized to a northern Amtrak route that neglects most population centers. The lack of passenger transit systems effectively cuts travel possibilities in half for hundreds of thousands people. Montanans deserve an option for the future that streamlines their transportation infrastructure, integrates them with the rest of the world, and provides an example of positive development. The intent of this thesis is to analyze the current network of people moving systems in Montana in order to determine how a better understanding of network dynamics and transportation architecture can help create connections to the global transportation network and foster positive growth. Information will be presented in graphic and literary form starting with the economic and transportation infrastructure in the region. Precedents are used to gain insight on existing and proposed architectural solutions to facilitate a proposal for an integrated transportation network in Montana, using architecture that utilizes continuous change, passage, and movement as active support.

As technology and innovation give shape to a malleable landscape of digital media, the world surges onward, pioneered by high-tech industries and everready consumers. International political and commercial forces are colliding and entwining in new ways as globalization increases and borderless commerce gains momentum. As the power struggle over consumer dollars and sociopolitical control has intensified a ""one planet"" mentality, globalization continues to exhibit our interconnectedness. However, another significant power struggle ferments between the human race and the planet itself and the impact of the former upon the ecological state of the latter. At the heart of this situation lies the environmental movement of activists and scientists alike, who seek remediation and revolution. The important questions, however, pertain to the world's readiness for and acceptance of a ""green revolution""; architecturally, this translates to the commercial and societal acceptance of truly sustainable and ecologically minded design and construction. The irony of the sustainable or ""green"" movement is that it is not truly sustainable itself - the philosophy and approaches behind current practice have not yet provided the impetus to ensure its staying power. The future of the postmodern ecological movement has the potential to be self-sustaining, drawing on the revolutionary power and the logic of the philosophy behind the very movement itself."

The manatees' coastal distribution coincides with areas of high human density, making manatees particularly vulnerable to human impacts. Important management decisions on both the state and federal level rely heavily on extinction models that require estimates of survival and reproductive rates. Current mark-recapture methods are unable to estimate survival rates for younger age classes because many young manatees lack the unique scarring used to identify individuals. Using an age-ratio technique, this research utilizes carcass recovery data to provide estimates of survival rates of Florida manatees < 4.5 years old while quantifying and incorporating all sources of uncertainty. The age-ratio technique requires counts of carcasses in each age class, carcass detection probabilities, and the proportion of animals alive in each age class. In order to determine the count of carcasses in each age class, several models were designed to estimate carcass age at death. First, using physiological criteria, models were developed to determine the probability a carcass died within two weeks of birth (perinatal) based on carcass length and month of carcass recovery. Next, mathematical models were created to estimate the error in ear-bone aging techniques. Lastly, models were developed to estimate age from length for carcasses dying at ages older than two weeks old. With these models, age at death could be estimated for 98% of all collected carcasses. Using data from a region where all survival and reproductive rates are known (Upper St. Johns), carcass relative detection ratios by age class were calculated. Assuming relative detection ratios are the same for all regions, young survival rate estimates were then calculated for all other regions. Results show uncertainty in young survival rates is higher than what was previously assumed.	['mortality']

Though there were thousands of Indian children who attended schools in Montana, boarding school culture there remains very much shrouded in mystery. This thesis illuminates individual biographies that intersect with manual arts training at the Fort Shaw Indian School that operated from 1892-1910. Thirteen sunken-relief wood carvings were created in this central Montana school, and now reside in the Smithsonian's vast repositories. A closer look at circumstances that led to their manifestation at the off-reservation federal institution reveals a complex public history of race, gender and curriculum. These examples, and others, illustrate the great potential of museum artifacts as informative sources that tether us to a not-so-distant past. This significant material warrants inclusion in the patchwork of memories that inform our understandings of boarding school cultures nationally. Further, the artworks featured in this thesis elucidate the work of child artisans on the northern plains who had previously been all but silenced and help us reengage with an era that is significant to our shared regional history.

But is westernization really the answer for this large 'third world' population? Westernization has stripped many of the cultures that make up sub-Saharan Africa of their knowledge bases, knowledge of tradition, and pride in culture. The principles behind International architecture indicate to this part of the world that the way they are living (with sensitivity to earth, season, and hardship) is uncivilized. That instead of grass huts that can be rebuilt if a drought causes a family to move, they must build multi-story buildings in town centers, out of concrete in order to be considered civilized. Instead, the loss of this pride in culture can be reversed. This thesis investigated whether or not architecture can be created in this third world region that gives thought to aesthetics, environment, culture and socio-economic situation; Can a building in sub-Saharan Africa be constructed for more than just the function of shelter, no matter what the aesthetic costs? Can it be functional, affordable, easily constructed and take into account design aesthetic? A new generation of architecture can emerge in Africa: a generation of sustainable, aesthetically sensitive buildings that educate inhabitants about their heritage and environment; a generation of architecture that begins to return pride in culture and heritage to populations in grave danger of losing knowledge of both.

During math I often find myself teaching to the middle, neglecting to meet the diverse needs of all of my students. This project focused on the effects of differentiated instruction on students' understanding of fifth-grade math concepts. The effects of differentiated instruction on the level of understanding, and both student and teacher attitudes and motivation were also considered. This project investigated the effects of differentiated instruction strategies as compared to traditional classroom instruction. Students' understanding of fifth-grade math concepts were assessed by comparing two differentiated instruction units to the traditional taught unit using pre and postunit assessment data, concept maps, exit cards, and interview data. Student motivation and engagement were assessed through student questionnaires, observations, and interviews. Effects on my own teaching, attitude, and motivation were determined through the use of journaling, self-evaluation, and peer observations. The results indicated an increase in student understanding, motivation, and engagement. Results also suggest that students developed a deeper level of understanding of fifth-grade math concepts as reflected in their ability to develop higher-order answers according to Bloom's Taxonomy. Increased student motivation and engagement positively affected my teaching, attitude, and motivation toward math instruction.

Bacterial biofilms are a major impediment to wound healing. The effective treatment of chronic wounds requires a better understanding of the relationship between bacterial biofilms and human skin. Human keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis and play essential roles in the inflammatory and epithelialization phases of wound repair. The aim of this dissertation was to determine the effect of biofilm-conditioned medium (BCM) and planktonic-conditioned medium (PCM) on inflammatory and epithelialization processes in keratinocytes. The phylogeny of chronic wounds was characterized to select a model pathogen. Staphylococcus aureus was found to be prevalent in chronic wounds. A novel in vitro model was developed to facilitate host-pathogen investigations between S. aureus biofilms and human keratinocytes. S. aureus BCM contained fermentation products and metabolites that regulate virulence. After four hours of exposure to BCM, pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated in keratinocytes relative to PCM. ELISA analysis of cytokine production in BCM-treated keratinocytes confirmed that after four hours of exposure, cytokine levels were higher relative to PCM-treated keratinocytes. However after 24 hours of exposure, BCM stalled the production of cytokines, suppressed activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases JNK and p38, and induced the release of intracellular calcium in keratinocytes. Processes relating to epithelialization such as the disruption of cytoskeletal components and induction of apoptosis were induced by BCM in keratinocytes. BCM induced a distinct inflammatory response and inhibited processes related to epithelialization. Collectively, the results provide insight into the formation and persistence of chronic wounds. The use of biofilm-based models of disease such as the in vitro model described herein will aid in the development of new biofilm based treatment strategies, not only for chronic wound infections, but all biofilm-based disease.

Unfortunately, these films and filmmakers often miss the mark, compromising or oversimplifying their message. I argue that these missteps are due to the fact that these films are reliant on the dominant culture for funding and distribution, and that culture will neither fund nor distribute any product that challenges its ideology too much. The discipline of political economy looks at how power structures determined and maintained by capitalism direct how media contacts the public. I analyze three environmental documentaries using the basic theories of political economy, and investigate how economics has affected the political goals of activist documentary. I argue that the internet offers both an opportunity to engage with the complexity of an issue through interactive design, as well as a way to potentially circumvent the more restrictive hurdles of a capitalist society.

Coal bed methane (CBM) development, resulting in the co-production of saline-sodic discharge water, is a potential new source of salinzation in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming. Constructed wetlands may serve to reduce CBM product water volumes while applying saline-sodic product water to a beneficial use. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of constructed wetlands as a new management tool for CBM product water management. To accomplish this, riparian species native to Montana and Wyoming and classified as halophytes were selected as experimental treatments. Species chosen were subjected to saline-sodic conditions designed to mimic CBM product water for a 24-week period and harvested once every 8 weeks. Water use rates, water chemistry, biomass production, forage value, and salinity tolerance of each species were monitored throughout the experimental period. Due to turbulent airflow and high diffusion rates of water vapor from the plant canopy, plant water use rates of mature plants exceeded reference evaporation rates over a range of salinities for most species. For high water use species, ratios between plant water use rates and reference evaporation exceeded 3.00 at lower salinities. High ratios between plant water use and reference evaporation indicate that reference evaporation buckets were not subjected to the same evaporative conditions as the plant canopy, and may not represent potential evapotranspiration. Biomass production of traditional wetland species declined following defoliation and under increasing salinity. Grass species increased biomass production following defoliation and under elevated salinity in the third growth period. Crude protein (CP) also decreased with progressive harvests for wetland species, but increased in the third period for grass species. Based on percent acid detergent fiber and CP, forage value of most species is equal to or greater than average grass hay forage value. Results suggest that wetlands constructed of species analyzed will thrive in salinesodic conditions, and will outperform or perform similarly to evaporation ponds for CBM product water disposal while providing a forage resource and beneficial use.

The topic of climate change presents a unique set of problems that require that a successful climate change film must rethink how the science is presented. Climate change is unique in that it has been so politicized that not only is it controversial, but a whole segment of the population (including those in government) simply doesn't believe that climate change exists. So each climate change film must be seen as an argument, and as a political document, if its goal is to persuade a skeptic that climate change does exist and needs to be actively addressed by the public and by government. Aristotle's rhetoric is a valuable foundation for creating a persuasive climate change argument in a climate change film. Each of Aristotle's proofs provides a guideline for persuasion. But these proofs are not complete without knowing how to frame your argument. Framing is a valuable cognitive political tool, used by conservatives for decades, and because each climate change film is a political document, framing is a necessary tool for the climate change filmmaker to use.

Through 1989, Montana farm operators enrolled nearly 2.7 million acres of cropland into the CRP. The first CRP contracts were entered into in 1986 and thus will expire in 1995. Under current policy, once the ten year period is over, cropland enrolled in the CRP can be returned to annual cropping, can be used in some alternative commercial use such as haying or grazing, or can remain in a conserving use. There is much concern in Montana and other states over how the future use of these acres could affect commodity prices, farm incomes, government outlays, rural economic activity, and environment quality. This study examines the factors to be used by individual Montana CRP contract holders upon contract expiration to decide the disposition of their CRP land among the alternative uses. A firm level mean-variance decision model is used to incorporate the risk involved with each alternative. The model also considers any one-time start-up costs that may be incurred to convert CRP acres into an alternative use. Test results using survey data from Montana contract holders suggest that very few CRP acres in Montana will remain in a conserving use. Most respondents indicated that they plan to either return all of their CRP acreage to annual cropping, or will hay/graze all of the acreage. The results suggest that the greater the percentage of income derived from range livestock, the more likely the CRP land will be hayed or grazed. Similarly, the greater the percentage of income derived from cropping, the more likely the CRP land will be returned to annual cropping. The evidence is that more CRP land will be hayed or grazed on operations that currently have haying/grazing activities, or that have physical attributes to facilitate haying/grazing activities.

CuAOs are known to have a multitude of physiological roles, and activity levels are upregulated in several pathological states. With the potential for therapeutic applications, substantial efforts were made to determine the molecular factors governing inhibitor selectivity. As such, several mechanism-based inhibitors were screened against CuAOs from bacterial, yeast, plant, and mammalian sources. The results provided vast insight into the molecular factors governing inhibitor potency in a bacterial (AGAO) and a plant (PSAO) CuAO. This was the defining work in establishing how certain aromatic residues in the substrate channel of AGAO directly control inhibitor potency. Furthermore, this work details the cross-reactivity between CuAOs and monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes using the antidepressant MAO-directed inhibitor tranylcypromine, and describes the characterization of a class of compounds which selectively inhibit only CuAOs. In addition to the studies aimed at understanding the molecular factors governing inhibitor binding in CuAOs, this work probes the role of copper during enzymatic reoxidation. Binding and inhibition studies of CuAOs were performed with the monodentate copper ligands cyanide and azide. Studies with cyanide provided the first spectroscopic evidence for cyanohydrin derivitization of TPQ in PSAO and led to the proposal of a detailed mechanism for inhibition of CuAO catalysis by cyanide. Azide studies in PSAO clearly revealed that azide was a competitive inhibitor towards substrate dioxygen, thereby supporting the viability of a redox role for copper. However, azide studies with a yeast CuAO were much more difficult to interpret, as azide was found to significantly inhibit the reaction velocity of both half-reactions. Lastly, temperature jump relaxation measurements of the internal redox equilibrium in AGAO were performed, allowing for the calculation of the electron transfer rate between reduced TPQ and copper(II). The results unequivocally establish that the copper(I)-semiquinone state is a viable catalytic intermediate in the reoxidation reaction of AGAO. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis provide evidence for a redox role of copper during the oxidative half-reaction, although further experimentation is necessary to confirm this.

I believe that a safe, well-structure, inquiry-based demonstration provides an opportunity to do both in a classroom; light a fire and fill a pail. And more specifically, a science demonstration draws on a student's natural wonder about the world around them. In only for a brief moment, a science demonstration causes the student to ask ""How did that happened?"" or ""Why did that just do that?"" At that moment and the moments that follow, a teacher has an extraordinary opportunity to simultaneously ""light a fire"" and to ""fill a pail."" This study aims to discover the best practice methods for improving the depth of learning and understanding that surrounds a well-structured, inquiry-based demonstration. Specifically, the study seeks to determine how the effectiveness of a demonstration can be increased when students are required to record observations and make connections between the demo and real-world applications. As well, the study aims to determine if peer collaboration and discussion is a critical element for student understanding and to make connections between textbook concepts and practical examples. Lastly, the study will evaluate the value of demonstrations presented in-person versus in video format. The study will involve two sections of Chemistry C, which is an elective upper-level course. Approximately 45 students will be included in the study. The study will be conducted during the unit Chemical Reactions and Types because the unit naturally includes several demonstrations within the curriculum. Qualitative and quantitative data collection methods will be utilized during the course of this study. These methods include a summative assessment for the Chemical Reactions and Types Unit, a student survey, a student questionnaire, several student interviews and several other data collection sources."

Such materials are not always randomly arranged, even in a natural environment. For example, applied strain can transform a randomly distributed assembly into a more regular arrangement. Deviations from random arrangements are described via material symmetry. A random collection exhibits textural isotropy whereas regular patterns are anisotropic. Among natural materials, snow is perhaps unique because thermal factors commonly induce microstructural changes, including material symmetry. This process temperature gradient metamorphism produces snow layers that can exhibit anisotropy. To adequately describe the behavior of such layers, mathematical models must account for potential anisotropy. This feature is absent from models specifically developed for snow, and, in most granular models in general. Material symmetry is quantified with fabric tensors in the constitutive models proposed here. Fabric tensors statistically characterize directional features in the microstructure. For example, the collective orientation of intergranular bonds impacts processes like conduction and loading. Anisotropic, microstructural models are analytically developed here for the conductivity, diffusivity, permeability, and stiffness of granular materials. The methodology utilizes homogenization an algorithm linking microscopic and macroscopic scales. Idealized geometries and constitutive assumptions are also applied at the microscopic scale. Fabric tensors tying the granular arrangement to affected material properties are a natural analysis outcome. The proposed conductivity model is compared to measured data. Dry dense snow underwent temperature gradient metamorphism in a lab. Both the measured heat transfer coefficient and a developing ice structure favored the direction of the applied gradient. Periodic tomography was used to calculate microstructural variables required by the conductivity model. Through the fabric tensor, model evolution coincides with measured changes in the heat transfer coefficient. The model also predicts a different conductivity in directions orthogonal to the gradient due to developing anisotropy. Models that do not consider directional microstructural features cannot predict such behavior because they are strictly valid for isotropic materials. The conclusions are that anisotropy in snow can be significant, fabric tensors can characterize such symmetry, and constitutive models incorporating fabric tensors offer a more complete description of material behavior.

Filmmakers continue to use the basic model of depicting people of indigenous cultures as exotic and more primitive than people of Western cultures with the effect of validating Western values and reinforcing the perceived superiority/authority of Western values over other value systems. This form is readily apparent in the treatment of the indigenous people of Africa in natural history films from the inception of the medium to present day. I will examine films from the 1920s through the present day. If filmmakers are to create successful natural history films that incorporate people of indigenous cultures, they must critically study the histories and mythologies that inform these films in order to avoid making the same mistakes.

Remedial coursework represents a void in time of students' lives when they are neither true college students nor enrolled members of a high school class. The onus of preparing Montana students for successful transitions to postsecondary education is on the shoulders of the school systems from which they graduate. Ultimately, paving the way for successful postsecondary transitions involves a number of different variables. The key facets of student achievement are embodied within school leaders, teachers and students. In this study, enrollment data gathered from the Montana University System was analyzed and a significant relationship was established between the variables of student ethnicity and socioeconomic status with enrollment in remedial writing. 243 English teachers in the state of Montana responded to items on the Support For Professional Development Questionnaire. The responses from this questionnaire revealed a high level of positive perception for administrator support for professional development among Montana English teachers. Lastly, this study highlighted that high school English teachers who participate in the MUS professional development activities express a greater understanding of the expected writing requirements for postsecondary institutions as compared to high school English teachers who do not participate in the MUS professional development activities.

C. burnetii is a potential bioterror agent and is classified by the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as a category B pathogen. This bacterium is remarkably infectious, requiring as little as one bacterium to cause infection. We used phase II C. burnetii, an avirulent laboratory strain that acts as a model for wild type phase I strains. Our research was directed towards a deeper understanding of the monocyte proteome in response to a) infection by phase II C. burnetii, and b) exposure to immune adjuvants known to increase monocyte resistance to infection by C. burnetii. Monomac I cells were infected with phase II C. burnetii and aliquots were taken at 24, 48, and 96 hours postinfection. Experiments with immune adjuvants that increase monocyte killing of C. burnetii, involved Monomac I cells treated with Securinine, E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Securinine is a GABA A receptor antagonist that is being developed at Montana State University for biodefense purposes, and triggers an innate immune response that differs from classic Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation of innate immunity represented by LPS and MPL. We employed multiplex 2D gel electrophoresis (m2DE) using ZDyes, a new generation of covalent fluorescent protein dyes being developed at Montana State University, coupled with MS/MS analysis and bioinformatics to determine the proteome changes in Monomac I cells in response to the conditions described above, and to develop a preliminary mechanistic model using a systems biology approach to account for the observed changes and propose multiple testable hypotheses to focus downstream research efforts. We also tested the effects on Monomac I cells infected with phase II C. burnetii +/- Securinine. We observed a high proportion of cell death in the + Securinine samples, using a dosage of Securinine higher than the optimal effective dosage. The information derived from this experiment will be useful in monitoring the tendency towards cell death in Securinine treated samples both from C. burnetii infected monocytes and other cell types (e.g. neurons) that contain GABA A receptors.

However, regardless of whether the Internet represents revolution or just evolution, it does provide a unique and unprecedented opportunity for environmental filmmakers to engage viewers in a thoughtful dialogue about how to improve the quality of our natural environment and the health of its inhabitants. This thesis examines how the Internet's capacity for nonmarket individual production and peer collaboration provides the basis for a new Internet film aesthetic that filmmakers can use to share stories of environmental crisis and hope. Specifically, the essay explores three storytelling techniques that work well within the medium of the Internet - the use of personal voice, the encouragement of community participation, and an embrace of a nonlinear structure. The thesis concludes by arguing that, rather than abandoning traditional, market-based media and relying exclusively on the Internet, environmental filmmakers have the most potential to affect change by creating films that can be adapted to work in a variety of media. The Internet may not be a revolution in itself, but it can be used as a tool for environmental filmmakers who seek to revolutionize our society's views about the environment and our place within it.

Latin and Greek morphemes were taught, recorded, and used in prediction and learning exercises. Pre and postunit and delayed assessments and concept interviews, pre and posttreatment surveys, my observations and journaling, peer observations, and a self-evaluation were analyzed. Results regarding student understanding and long-term memory were inconclusive. The data showed that students' ability to predict new vocabulary meanings improved. Students' attitudes and motivation were not affected and my attitudes were at first positive, but later declined.

Implementation of most water quality improvement efforts addressing this issue is voluntary. Thus, it is important to present land owners with simple, cost effective approaches to mitigate water quality impairment. An armored stanchion (AS) water access was designed, implemented, and tested on Thompson and Story Creeks near Belgrade, MT. Riparian fencing was constructed to allow access at a water gap where the AS was constructed. The AS allows animals to access spring creek water to drink but does not allow them to enter the stream. An AS was constructed adjacent to a traditional (TRAD) water access on each stream for comparison. Water quality impairment was quantified downstream of each access with and without animals actively using the accesses. Instantaneous loads of E. coli, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO3), total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate (PO4) were evaluated using Kruskal Wallis procedures. Contaminant loading from the AS access was not significantly greater than loading from the control with or without animals present. The Story Site did not consistently produce significant differences for the TRAD access with animals present versus absent under the different analysis approaches employed. Results at the Thompson Site produced significant differences for E. coli, TKN, and TP for the TRAD access when animals were present versus absent from the access. Estimates were made of percentage of time cattle occupied the Thompson TRAD access. These estimates facilitated calculation of daily loads attributed to animals actively using the access. For E. coli the load was 6.0 E9 CFU per day, 425.9 g per day for TKN, and 53.1 g per day for TP. These results indicate the AS access can reduce water quality impacts from cattle, compared to traditional access methods.

This thesis will expound how architecture reflects, and contributes to, an identity via spoken language and diachronic cultural signals. While our built world is not easily reduced to literally grammatical morphemes, architecture offers equally meaningful, albeit abstract, messages of semiotic importance. I believe it is our individual and collective rendering of language that affords the promise of multiple understandings and creative solutions. Yet, the messages presented and perceived by our designed surroundings, at home and abroad, remain largely under-analyzed and discounted as prospective remedies to universal problems. Our built environment speaks enormously about our past and future, social priorities, demographic fluxes, aesthetic proclivities, etc. Ultimately, it is the world we construct which conveys our identity and prompts recognition of each other and ourselves. I accept a future where architecture obliges a global acuity that acknowledges an associative, multi-presence of cultures and can translate an identifiable 'local' character. Similarly, an architectural disparity manifest from a multilingual society affords a unique opportunity to study how language might be structured, to influence a formative role in architecting a pluralist future. This thesis will consider how the protracted marginalization of a culture and the gradual forfeiture of its language challenge how a cultural 'memory' is sustained - despite a steady linguistic and architectural regression. In fact, contrasting architectural and linguistic practices used by burgeoning communities, this thesis will examine how economic and geographic isolation have led moribund minorities to an assortment of survival strategies, including - aside from emigration or assimilation - a dependence on mythologized culture and the memorializing of architecture as bastions for identity and remembering a common history. If identity is memory, then the linguistic vestiges of a place offer a chance to recall and re-imagine an architectural lingo that fortifies a prior history, so as to re-contextualize a shared future in a country, and in a world, of competing cultural identities. This thesis will explore how architecture may inherently propagate a 'dialogue' in multilingual domains, for a temporal dissemination of identity by virtue of memory communities.

Their narratives give meaning to our everyday experiences and help us understand our world. Wildlife and natural history films in telling stories about the nature help define, to some extent, our relationship with it. Following the historical development of the classical narrative model in wildlife and nature films, the paper explores its impact on conservation choices and argues for an alternative approach to narrative in these films in order to change the oppositional relationship that we currently share with the nature.

For people over the age of 65 years it is the most common reason for hospital admission and many of these people have to be readmitted to the hospital because of HF exacerbations. Follow-up care by professional nurses in the immediate time period after hospital discharge to home is limited despite suggestions from research studies that it may be helpful in decreasing the occurrence of exacerbations from HF, and thus decrease rehospitalizations. This project was developed with the support of a local physician with the purpose of investigating the needs of HF patients after they had been discharged from the hospital. Part one of the project involved a literature review centered on the topic of home care follow-up for this population. Part two of the project was the collection of data obtained during home visits by the author with the participants. The third part of the project included the compilation of results. Of the five participants taking part in this project the two with the least amount or no supportive care had unanswered questions and voiced some lack of confidence in their ability to take care of their needs. The other three participants were comfortable that their needs would be met by the supportive care providers who were involved with their care. The findings from this project would suggest that patients with HF may not have their needs totally met by the time they are discharged from the hospital. Each patient will have individual variation in their needs. A post hospitalization phone call or home visit from a professional nurse may provide an opportunity for clarification of symptom management.

The first step toward achieving true pluralism on any college campus is to discover what the current campus climate for diversity is. Through listening to individuals, qualitative methods can allow the researcher to hear diverse perspectives that quantitative methods might likely miss. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the experiences and perceptions of students at Montana State University-Bozeman (MSU-Bozeman) in order to assess the current campus climate, specifically with regard to diversity issues. The research design was a qualitative phenomenology triangulated with document analysis. The study focused on the phenomenon of campus climate as experienced by the students who were interviewed. Individual interviews performed during the 1997-98 academic year and supplemented with university-level document analysis allowed for comparison of student perceptions and University intentions and actions. A total of 68 undergraduate students who were enrolled for the 1997-98 academic year responded to open-ended interviews. These included students who identified themselves as African American (8), Asian American (12), Caucasian American (24), Hispanic American (12), and Native American (12). Findings include a brief overview of results for each of the student groups involved in the study, which highlight the differences among student groups. A discussion of the implications for practice tied to the improvement of general campus climate is included; these implications stem from the shared experiences across all groups of students interviewed and, thus, would improve not only the general campus climate for the entire student body, but at the same time also improve the campus climate for diversity. Finally, a discussion of specific implications for practice related to improving the campus climate for diversity is included. These recommendations are based on the experiences of each of the groups of students interviewed, the document analysis completed, and the review of the literature regarding the study of campus climate.

In the first experiment, twenty-four heifers were fed a basal diet composed of wheat middlings and corn grain (15% CP and 79% TDN). Twelve heifers were supplemented with trace minerals to provide an additional 399 mg Cu, 1001 mg Zn, and 707 mg Mn/d. The control diet had no supplemental trace minerals added. All heifers were inoculated with an oral dose of 1010 CFU of E. coli O157:H7. Fecal samples were collected every 18 h for the first three days after dosing and then every three d until d 21 to determine E. coli O157:H7 shedding rates. On d 7 venous blood was collected, and on d 21 liver tissue and venous blood were collected. Trace mineral supplementation did not increase IBR titers (P=0.50) but increased (P<0.005) liver Cu concentration. There were no differences in the rate of fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 between treatments, but the SEM between treatments often were as great as the mean values. E. coli O157:H7 decreased in concentration during the first 21 d. Unexpectedly, after d 21, fecal E. coli O157:H7 concentration increased to a level measured 18 h post-inoculation. These results suggest that supplemental trace minerals did not influence the rate of E. coli O157:H7 shedding. This may be due to a lack of nutritional stress on the animals (no differences in IBR titers), or because the control diet provided adequate trace minerals. In the second experiment, 374 steers were split into two groups to determine if an experimental E. coli vaccine would reduce fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 during the first 56 d after weaning. Calves did not shed E. coli O157:H7 during either sampling period (d 0 or d 55). There was no difference in fecal shedding of the bacteria between the control and vaccinated treatments. There was, however, an unexplained difference (P < 0.0001) in ADG, with vaccinated calves gaining 0.11 kg/d more than the control treatment. These data indicate that E. coli O157:H7 is not a problem at this ranch in Montana.

I posit that, while many scholars have done a commendable job of creating new pedagogical space where evangelical students can explore issues of religious identity and faith in writing, more work still needs to be done in collecting student descriptions of and perspectives on the faith-learning integration actually undertaken (or avoided) in these secular contexts. Using phenomenography-a method that seeks to uncover the various ways that individuals experience the world around them-I conduct a pilot study of evangelical Montana Bible College undergraduates who enroll as visiting students at Montana State University in order to fulfill graduation requirements in composition. By augmenting current studies with phenomenographic observations and surveys results, I attempt to offer a more ""complex"" portrait of evangelical students than the one that typically emerges in most composition research on this topic. I suggest that these experience-based methods have the potential to reveal key student struggles and needs, which should be explored further as faith-learning integration pedagogies are designed and implemented in future college writing curriculums."

The minimum-data approach of Antle and Valdivia (2006) responds to this need by supplying a spatially explicit first order approximation that models ecosystem supply by producers. However, producers in developing nations often are observed to deviate from simple expected profit maximization. Risk is one possible explanation for this divergence. This study builds upon the minimum-data approach by allowing for risk averse producer preferences. The study presents a framework for translating relative risk aversion measurements into the parameters needed for the mean-standard deviation utility function. This study utilizes experimental and econometric measurements of risk aversion by other researchers to parameterize the model. Historic weather data are used with crop yield models to simulate temporal variation in crop yields. The model is used to simulate the supply of carbon sequestration in Machakos, Kenya. At low levels of risk, producers behave in a manner consistent with risk neutrality. However as risks and risk aversion levels increase, there is an increasing divergence from the behavior implied by expected profit maximization. The effects of varying the structure of risk preferences were also examined. This study finds that, consistent with the results in a number of other studies, the level of risk aversion is generally a more important factor in simulated behavior than the structure of risk preferences. This study also examines the effects of increasing the spatial variation of returns. As the spatial variation of returns increases, the predicted producer behavior converges on a fifty percent rate of adoption of the carbon sequestering system, regardless of other parameters. Overall, this study finds that - at levels of risk aversion measured in similar populations in developing nations - the inclusion of risk aversion in the model provides an explanation for why the observed behavior of producers appears to diverge from expected profit maximization.

However, despite the recent proliferation of these films, there is much discussion in the science filmmaking community about how ineffective these films have been lately at informing the public about science and compelling viewers to act. It is time to look at the underlying definitions of the genre from a different perspective and determine whether the current standards are the best way to successfully convey messages about science to the widest audience. To explore the possibilities for increasing the effectiveness of science filmmaking, one needs to look at the basic assumptions that come into play during the process of producing science films by re-framing the major components of the science film: goals, subject matter, audience, and format. This new set of paradigms reveals the possibility of another avenue - fiction.

This study evaluates the economic potential of confinement sheep production for the region of the Northern Rocky Mountains and the Northwestern Great Plains. The extent and composition of confinement sheep production within the region is surveyed. The main elements available to alternative sheep production systems are cataloged, and the ramifications of each element for different systems are estimated. Four sheep production systems representative of the range of alternatives are defined and budgeted. These four systems are economically evaluated by means of multi-period simulation. Sensitivity analysis is used both to replicate variations in the four systems and to measure the importance of variations in the budget estimates. It is concluded that a major transition to confinement production is unlikely under current conditions. However, confinement production can be a viable alternative under certain circumstances. It is also demonstrated that marginal tax rates are important factors in determining net profitability and should be included in economic evaluations of production alternatives.

It is difficult for caregivers to cope with substantial changes in behavior, personality, and communication associated with this illness. Consequently, as the population ages the incidence of dementia will increase. It draws particular importance to the family caregiver role in maintaining the activities of daily care and managing unpredictable, progressive changes of the disease. Caregivers of persons with dementia take on a role that has considerable responsibility. Family caregivers also experience an added sense of duty that often leads to caregiver stress and burden. The purpose of this project was to develop an educational program. The program included a comprehensive literature review, input gathered from two assistive living homes and one senior center, and a one-hour educational presentation. The one hour educational presentation was presented at two assisted living homes and one senior center. Careful consideration was given to the aspects of stress and burden on family care givers of individuals with dementia. Psychosocial interventions, caregiver self-care, community resources, and interventions to assist with activities of daily living were also discussed. Content for the educational presentation addressed the following topics: signs and symptoms of dementia; interventions to assist with communication, behavioral and environmental management; and community resources to help with caregiver burden. Of the eight key lessons learned, two lessons are important to note. First, it is imperative to assess the emotional needs of the caregiver prior to the program development. Second, caregivers require an individualized approach to dealing with individuals with dementia. Important roles for Family Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (FPMHNP) are to provide anticipatory guidance to family caregivers about managing the changes in behavior, personality, and communication associated with dementia. They should also develop individualized, appropriately tailored, psychosocial interventions for the management of dementia. The FPMHNP is instrumental in assisting family caregivers with self-care management and providing information on community resources.

Many scholars and scientists have critiqued various aspects of the genre's overall construction as contributing to the maintenance of the separation between humans and nature. Beyond these structural critiques, there seems to be a more fundamental ideological consequence resulting from the relationship between the cinematic techniques used in creating science and natural history programming and the audience. The genre's dependence on new technologies of ""seeing"" is indicative of the underlying epistemology of the medium and suggests the importance of understanding ideological consequences of the cinematic apparatus itself. One of these new ways of ""seeing"" that is particularly useful for exploring the relationship between the cinematic apparatus and the audience is high-speed digital photography. An investigation of the historical origins of both the photograph and the cinema will show how high-speed photography is representative of the deeply ingrained epistemological foundations of these pictorial technologies. Photography's origins as a manifestation of scientific objectivity position the medium uniquely as a popularizer of scientific and factual information. Exploring the dynamic between the scientific profession and the lay public is integral to teasing apart how the genre of science and natural history documentary film affects the viewer. Photographic technologies privileged status as an unfiltered representation of physical truth lies at the center of the development of positivist science and the popularization of science and nature. Its privileged status derives from the denial of human subjectivity and the emphasis of mechanically mediated representations of the world. The cinematic apparatus' techno-scientific origins and its implicit promise to supplement our deficient perceptual abilities paradoxically functions to distance the viewer from the world it so acutely represents."

And, these paintings incorporate many of the traditional aspects of representing the nude figure: they are constructed on panels and painted in thin, transparent layers. They utilize linear and atmospheric perspective in order to achieve the illusion of space. They are monumental in scale. The colors are derived from a limited palette, and the figures are grouped in artificial ways. At first glance, they appear to be traditional figure paintings. Closer inspection reveals anomalies to traditional figure painting. The figures appear transparent and incorporeal, as though aware they are constructed of paint. The underpainting is pronounced, and repentancesâpentimentoâquite apparent. These 2 effects fix the figures somewhere between the physical surface of the picture, and the illusionary space of the painting. The interplay of these paintings as they shift between physical, two-dimensional object and illusionistic window is carried through to the frames. The traditional function of the frameâto organize the space of the painting, to eliminate outside distraction, to focus the attention of the viewerâis hybridized to serve multiple functions. Spaces in the frame that are real, that are actual, echo spaces in the painting that are illusionistic. This activity unites the painting with its frame. The real transparency of the space in the frame is allowed to contrast the painted transparency of the painted surface, calling into question the differences of each, and allowing frame to be as painterly, as gestural, as illusionistic as the painted surface.

Despite the heightened importance of snowpack, few studies have considered the representation of uncertainty in coupled snowmelt/hydrologic conceptual models. Uncertainty estimation provides a direct interpretation of the risk associated with predictive modeling results. Bayesian inference, through the application of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, provides a statistical means of approximating uncertainty associated with both the parameters and the model structure. This thesis addresses the complexities of predictive modeling in hydrology through the development, implementation and analysis of a suite of conceptual hydrologic models under a Bayesian inference framework. The research is presented in four main sections. First, a comparative assessment of three recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, based on their performance across two case studies, is performed. This study has revealed that the extreme complexity of the parameter space associated with simple, conceptual models is best explored by the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Second, a complete description of the models and study site incorporated in the study are presented, building on established theories of model development. Third, an investigation of the value of each model structure, considering predictive performance, uncertainty and physical realism is presented. This section builds on results of the first section, through the application of the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm for model calibration and uncertainty quantification under Bayesian principles. Finally, a discussion of the Simulation and Prediction Lab for Analysis of Snowmelt Hydrology, developed to incorporate the tasks of model selection, calibration and uncertainty analysis into a simple graphical user interface is explained. The application of a complete modeling framework from model selection to calibration and assessment presented in this thesis represents a holistic approach to the development of improved understanding of snow-dominated watersheds through prediction by coupled snowmelt/hydrologic modeling strategies.

Most hyperthermophilic viruses isolated from the archaeal sub-domain Crenarchaeota belong to the Sulfolobales family. We have focused on the isolation and analysis of viruses replicating in Sulfolobus. Sulfolobus is an acidophilic hyperthermophile that lives optimally at 80Â°C and pH 3. The SSVs (Sulfolobus spindle-shaped viruses) are the viruses most commonly isolated from thermal acidic areas around the world. SSVs are dsDNA spindle-shaped viruses with genomes of approximately 15kb. They are also the predominant virus isolated from samples collected in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). The SIRVs (Sulfolobus islandicus rodshaped viruses) are also commonly isolated from YNP. These viruses have linear dsDNA genomes of approximately 33kb. I have used these two viruses to investigate the interaction of time and viral population dynamics. For a comparison between geographically isolated acidic hot springs, we chose to study three sites in YNP. These three sites were monitored continuously for changes in virus populations, archaeal host populations, and water chemistry. Each monitor site was chemically unique, but the water chemistry did not significantly change over time. The archaeal population in each of the three hot springs was unique and was found to slowly change over time. We have discovered that although there can be a substantial change in viral population structures in between the collection of samples, it does not seem to be correlated with a changing environmental parameter. There also appears to be a strong culturing bias present in the SSVs when we compare the virus population monitored directly from the environment to the viruses isolated from an enrichment culture established from a particular hot spring. A long term goal is to contribute to the understanding of the relationships between time and resident viral populations within hot spring environments. We hope this work will contribute a further understanding of life in extreme environments.

For males, the achievement of the status of ""manhood"" is essential to be considered truly male. Because of the cultural importance of this achievement, many cultural artifacts reflect and revolve around it. The exploration and celebration of manhood thus often forms the basis for works of art. In the case of film, an art form practiced much more commonly by men, examples abound. However, not all filmic narratives about masculinity take the same approach to the issue. While many portray the achievement of manhood in a simple, celebratory way, some in fact challenge cultural ideas of masculinity. The purpose of this essay is to discuss and identify these subversive masculinity narratives, with the goal of establishing a dimorphic categorization system. This system delineates masculinity narratives between a traditional, celebratory type, and a new, self-aware/self-reflexive type. For the purposes of this discussion I analyze several examples of mainstream masculinity narratives: the films Fight Club and Die Hard, and Shakespeare's Hamlet. I intend to show how the different portrayals of masculinity in these works either reinforce or subvert traditional cultural ideas of masculinity, and seek to establish a model for the new masculinity genre. To study these issues from another angle, I also look at an avant-garde work, Matthew Barney's Cremaster 3: The Order. This second analysis shows how mainstream masculinity narratives, both the traditional and new varieties, can be packaged and discussed in an experimental work. Ultimately, this essay establishes a new/traditional masculinity binary, as both a lens for analyzing current works, and a mold for creating new ones."

69626	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2320	An assessment of allopathic and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider's perceptions of their patients health literacy	The purpose of this study was to explore how allopathic and Complementary and Alternative Medicine CAM) clinicians address health literacy in their practices. The research questions guiding this study were 1.) How do clinicians convey complex health information to their patients? 2.) Do clinicians believe health literacy is the responsibility of the health care provider, the patient, or the health care system? 3.) Do allopathic and CAM clinicians think differently about where the responsibility rests? The research regarding the impact of low health literacy in the U.S. is prolific but the literature is less rich regarding what clinicians are doing to improve the literacy levels of their patients in their practices. The Institute of Medicine's Health Literacy model provided the underlying conceptual framework for this study. The data collection procedure was two focus group interviews of health care providers, one group of allopathic providers and the other group (CAM) providers. The results indicated that all clinicians used an educational strategy during their patient visits with the intent to improve their patients' health literacy. Common themes regarding the way clinicians present health information were identified based on discussions and comments during the focus groups. These themes are direct questioning, health contexts, trust development, educational materials, and analogies. The practice implications for this study include a) consider incorporating simple health literacy screening or measurement practices during every patient contact, b) openly support public health efforts to increase awareness of the prevalence and depth of limited health literacy at state and local levels c) conduct health literacy lectures in both professional and public forums to help decrease the roadblock of shame for individuals with limited literacy. The research implications of this study include a need for further research determining what clinicians and health care organizations are doing to embrace a health literacy agenda among private practitioners and the health care system. Further research exploring practical and effective ways to measure health literacy could improve clinician strategies to promote health literacy, numeracy, and language skills necessary for patients to become empowered as they navigate the health care system.

Specifically, the study sought to determine if storytelling sessions, involving science mysteries and historical narratives about scientists and their discoveries, would be effective instructional aids for helping students understand the way science is conducted. The study involved thirty-one sixth graders in two sections of a life science class. The storytelling sessions and related inquiry activities were implemented on a bi-weekly basis during a three month period. Pre and post-treatment surveys and interviews, periodic questionnaires, and daily observations were used to assess students' perspectives and reactions. The results of this study showed that storytelling combined with dialogue and inquiry improved students' attitudes about doing science and generated fresh depth and breadth of perception about the nature of science. The historical narratives were well suited to making science facts more meaningful and memorable, while the science mysteries were more effective in helping students generate investigative questions.

To aid in the detection of proteins at lower concentrations, DIGE dyes, a family of spectrally resolved fluorescent dyes, are currently available to proteomic researchers for 2D gel analysis. However, the demands of protein detection dictate that dyes that are even more sensitive and versatile be created. The syntheses of highly sensitive, water soluble BODIPY fluorophore dyes are described. These dyes are proposed to have the necessary sensitivity to allow for detection of proteins in much lower concentrations, providing an improvement over current protein detection limits. The BODIPY dyes that have been synthesized are available in a variety of absorbances and emissions. While fluorescent dyes that are amine-reactive are the most popular covalently binding protein labeling markers being used in today's proteomic research, thiol-reactive fluorescent markers are gaining importance in proteomic research. Since thiol residues are less common in proteins compared to their amine counterparts, saturation labeling and quantification are more easily achieved. The syntheses of sensitive thiol- reactive fluorescent dyes are described. These syntheses allow for quick generation of thiol-reactive fluorescent markers to be used in proteomic research.

A synthetic, carbohydrate-functionalized, multivalent framework is ideal to study biological protein/carbohydrate interactions. In this research, dendrimers are used as a platform for the display of carbohydrates to study multivalent galectin-3/carbohydrate interactions as they pertain to tumor aggregation. The hypothesis is that the addition of carbohydrate functionalized dendrimers will mimic natural galectin-3 glycoconjugate ligands, affecting the aggregating behavior of neoplastic cells. A galectin-3 inhibitor may prove to be an effective cancer therapeutic agent. Results from homotypic aggregation assays show a change in aggregation with the addition of particular carbohydrate-functionalized dendrimers. Two of the glycodendrimers significantly inhibit tumor cell aggregation.

In an effort to reduce the number of roadway departures, many transportation agencies have introduced static rumble strips using physical alterations of the roadway surface in shoulder and/or centerline sections of the roadway. Recently, more advanced technology has been developed in the form of in-vehicle advanced lane departure warning systems that automatically detect the vehicle's lane position and warn of possible roadway departures. These systems are currently showing their value in some commercial trucks in Europe, and are now available in some U.S. passenger cars. Two critical factors will govern their ultimate success; (1) their ability to warn the driver in an effective and timely manner to make the correct action, and (2) their success in gaining driver trust and acceptance. The primary goal of this research was to better understand basic human factors principles of haptic and auditory interfaces as a collision avoidance technique during run-off-road and head-on collisions and driver perception of these modalities. In this simulator study, fifteen participants received alerting cues in three sensory modalities; haptic (seat vibration), auditory (""rumble strip"" sound), and combined auditory and haptic sensory warnings. A preliminary psychophysical study was conducted to determine appropriate and comparable intensities of the warning modalities. The results of this study determined that the haptic modality produced significantly faster reaction times than both the auditory and combination modalities. The auditory modality produced significantly more maximum steering response than the haptic and combination condition. Drivers perceived the haptic modality to be the least annoying with least interference, while the combination modality was the most preferred in benefit of driving, most likely to purchase, level of trust, level of appropriateness, level of urgency, and overall preference. Haptic (seat vibration) warnings demonstrate promise as an alerting strategy over auditory and combination modalities in reducing roadway departures. With a decrease in reaction time, less erratic steering responses, and relatively advantageous perceptions from drivers, haptic warnings have the potential to better assist drivers in returning to the lane more quickly and safely."

The decline was especially pronounced on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), the most widely used college entrance examination. Much of this decline remains unexplained. This study examines the hypothesis that declining returns to college education played a role in the score decline. Specifically, it is hypothesized that declining returns to education reduce the incentive for students to invest in the college skills which the SAT attempts to measure. This study proposes a general model in which SAT participation rates and SAT scores are determined in part by the relative wage differential between an average college graduate and a high school graduate. several empirical specifications of this model are then estimated, using aggregate time series data for the years 1967 to 1987. The methods of three stage least squares and seemingly unrelated regressions are used. The results of the regressions suggest that fluctuations in the relative economic return to a college education may have accounted for between 11 percent,and 24 percent of the decline in average SAT scores. When these effects are considered in conjunction with those of a demographic variable, approximately 40 percent of the decline is explained, perhaps suggesting that fears of declining educational quality are somewhat exaggerated.

While 50% of students who test at a C to D average felt the LSC was helpful, 83% of the A to B average students said the LSC was beneficial. One can infer that the A-B students appreciated the LSC because they routinely use tools that have the potential to improve their learning. As a communication tool, the LSC accurately informed the teacher of student readiness in skills that require one step and less accurately demonstrated student readiness for multi-step tasks. Furthermore, student surveys revealed that the LSC shows potential to improve as a communication tool with simple revisions.

This research sought to integrate science content with literacy instruction so that students would not miss out on vital science knowledge they would go on to need in fifth grade. Fourth grade students in one classroom read science content books during small group guided reading instruction that focused on the current science unit of study. Students also visited the classroom science literacy center weekly to explore science books and practice reading comprehension skills taught in the classroom. Student surveys and interviews along with classroom and district assessments were used to measure students' science content knowledge, nonfiction reading comprehension skills, and interest in science literacy throughout the research.

This study reviews landscape influences on riparian zone processes in mountainous headwater catchments, and combines recent findings and management techniques into a conceptual analysis of riparian zone hydrology and nutrient export. A case study synthesizing recently published work in Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF) is developed outlining riparian zone hydrology, riparian buffering, and nutrient export. We demonstrate that a major influence on the hydrology and nutrient export in mountainous catchments can be landscape structure, and use this finding as a framework to develop a conceptual approach to riparian zones in mountainous areas. The conceptual analysis is intended to inform management through the identification of riparian areas that are important for stream water quality depending on hydrologic drivers in the catchment. Understanding the variability of riparian zone hydrology and subsequent water quality impacts will allow for more focused and informed management decisions for riparian areas.

Low-level exposures of radiation may result in cancer and leukemia. A radiation mishap can occur at a missile site, a research or medical facility using radioactive material, a fixed nuclear facility, during nuclear detonation, and during transport of nuclear material. Guidance and education for limiting personal radiation exposure and how to combat radiation hazards would effectively reduce the number of individuals exposed if such a disaster were to occur. The intent of this project was to create an educational tool that would guide the residents of Cascade County in radiation awareness and ways to minimize radiation exposure to themselves and their families should a mishap occur. The outcome was the creation of a brochure for Cascade County's Disaster and Emergency Services department to use as an educational tool for the residents of Cascade County for radiation disaster preparedness. The brochure provides an organized, reader friendly outline of prevention of radiation exposure.	['life sciences', 'physiology', 'biology', 'health', 'medicine', 'human biology', 'science']

In experiment 2, adapted grasses and legumes were compared under tilled and no-till seedbed preparation to assess their performance. In Experiment 1, the effects of timing of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] application, two alfalfa cultivars (including a roundup ready alfalfa) and five irrigation levels were investigated in Bozeman, MT in an old alfalfa stand in a subirrigated location. Experiment 2 was planted contiguous to Experiment 1; 11 forage species were planted in early summer (24 June) and late summer (28 August) under irrigation. During establishment year, applying glyphosate four weeks before planting resulted in a higher plant population and alfalfa yield than all the other treatments. Differences were not detected in the post-establishment year. The establishment of no-till alfalfa was very low in the second planting year, likely due to wet and colder weather. Alfalfa yield during the establishment year responded significantly to irrigation level and the effect was not relevant for yield in the post-establishment year. No-till legumes and grasses in the summer resulted in yields similar to those following conventional seedbed preparation although higher in early summer than late summer. Grasses had about four times higher yields than legumes in part, because post-emergence broadleaf control was less effective in legumes. Late summer planting resulted in high weed encroachment and low target forage yields. These results indicate that delaying planting four weeks after spraying with glyphosate and controlled irrigation is a promising no-till alfalfa planting system but highly dependent on establishment weather conditions. No-till grasses offer an opportunity to impact the wide use of no-till to increase yield in an old alfalfa stand, but post-emergence weed control would be a key management especially in legumes.

Is it enough to be familiar with vocabulary words and to learn concepts others have figured out? Or should the desire to know be the initiator and sustainer of the learning situation? How should science be taught? This project studies the effect of using the 5E method of inquiry - Engage, Explore, Explain, Extend, Evaluate - to teach sixth grade students. Of interest was the effect it would have on students' attitude towards science, their understanding of science content, students' data collection and data organizational skills, students' ability to design and conduct a controlled experiment, and the effect on the teacher. Ninety-seven students were taught two units using the 5E method of inquiry. The results were compared to units that were taught by non-inquiry methods. Student tests, surveys, interviews, and performance tests were considered in the analysis. The conclusions were that students did improve data collection and organizational skills and in their ability to design and conduct a controlled experiment. Content scores were actually lower for the inquiry unit. Interviews and surveys indicated that students were more engaged in the inquiry units. Survey results showed that students liked science less after the year of school but teacher observations and student interviews confirmed more engagement. Survey results showed that the change in attitude was due to it being more complicated. The units using inquiry methods took longer to complete than non-inquiry units. The teacher could not just cover the material. Students needed time to process the information and discuss and explore with activities. Inquiry methods created more work for me, the teacher, because I had to alter the activities to make them inquiry, and compile student data to find patterns in student ideas. The misconceptions were more obvious since students were required to explain and discuss, and it took time to deal with these misconceptions. It was exciting work because there was a strong feeling of engagement in the classroom.

Data collected for this qualitative study was in the form of transcripts of interviews conducted by the researcher. Participant campuses were selected by the Assistant Montana Commissioner for Higher Education for Distance Education. Participants were the identified with the assistance of campus distance education directors at each of the campuses. The campuses identified are part of the Montana University System, and a fourth campus identified is a community college, administered in part by the Montana University System. Participants responded to a series of questions posed by the researcher. The transcripts of these interviews were analyzed for common themes, and these themes were then used to describe the methods currently being employed by faculty and administrators actively engaged in delivering distance education programs.

This process is accelerated by the activity of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria which grow chemolithotrophically in mine tailings. Low cost, environmentally acceptable, and low maintenance treatment technologies are needed to both treat acid mine drainage and prevent its occurrence. The addition of dissolved organic carbon to mine tailings has the potential to stimulate beneficial heterotrophic populations of bacteria at the expense of iron and sulfur oxidizers. These experiments investigated the use of three organic carbon sources: molasses, cheese whey and methanol in controlling acid mine drainage from two tailings sources. All three organic carbon sources are easily dissolved in water, relatively inexpensive, and easily transported to remote locations. Mine tailings were acquired from the Fox Lake Mine (Manitoba) and the Mammoth Mine (Montana) and were packed into columns. Columns were watered on a weekly basis and dissolved organic carbon was periodically applied. The treatments increased pH up to 3 units over untreated controls, while simultaneously decreasing oxidation-reduction potential over 300 mV. Sulfate reducing bacteria were stimulated in columns treated with organic carbon, as were heterotrophic populations. Some iron- and sulfur-oxidizing organisms were found to be capable of heterotrophic growth, a condition which compromised treatment effectiveness. Individual organic carbon treatments were found to vary in pH/ORP effect from several months to over 2 years. Phylogenetic analysis of column samples suggests both a robust population of bacteria in untreated mine tailings and the growth of SRB resulting from treatment.

Since 1992 the median age of superintendents increased to 52.5, the oldest recorded median age for superintendents during the twentieth century. The results of this study indicated during the coming decade half of the nation's superintendents will retire. In 1999, the Montana School Boards Association, the School Administrators of Montana, the Certification and Standards and Practices Advisory Committee and the Department of Education at Montana State University, conducted a study that assessed school administrator shortages in Montana. The study indicated that 61.3% of districts had hired an administrator within the last three years. A study conducted by Dr. Dori Neilson (2002) for the Montana State Action for Education Leadership Project (SAELP) revealed that 48% of administrators in Montana school districts plan to retire within the next five years. Communication between the superintendent and school board is a mechanism that will improve relations between the parties and may increase superintendent longevity. A thorough performance appraisal of the superintendent can improve communication between board members and the superintendent. The problem addressed in this study is that it is unknown by state leaders and policy-makers to what degree, based on the perceptions of practicing Montana public school superintendents, evaluations of school superintendents in Montana are aligned to the Performance Domains identified by DiPaola and Stronge (2003). A t-test of Independent Samples revealed significant differences in several areas regarding alignment of current Montana superintendent evaluation practices to the Domains. An understanding of current practices for evaluating the superintendent in Montana revealed areas of improvement that will result in improved superintendent evaluation practices. Evaluations that improve communication between school boards and superintendents of Montana school districts will provide a framework to increase superintendent longevity and decrease the need to hire a superintendent in a job market that is experiencing a shortage of qualified candidates. This study provides recommendations for revisions of policies and laws governing evaluation of Montana superintendents and training of Montana school board members in superintendent evaluation.

Students rotated through the garden project on a trimester basis in groups of six or seven and were given responsibility for all aspects of the garden program from choosing which seeds to plant to running the monthly campus farmers' market. Weekly blog posts, survey and questionnaire responses, teacher observations and interview responses were analyzed to determine the effects of working in the garden on the students. Results showed that student interest in gardening increased over the course of the project assignment, as well as knowledge of sustainable agriculture practices. Connections to content learned in the classroom were also strengthened through student involvement in the garden project.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

Specifically, it is not known to what degree mathematics school leaders use technology in assessment analysis, and if that analysis is related to student achievement in mathematics. Educators and math students in Montana ""AA"" high schools are the studied population in this research. Math instructional personnel and building leadership were administered a data-driven decision-making (DDDM) diagnostic to determine their capacity for using technology in the process of DDDM. Educators from 10 of the 13 ""AA"" high schools participated in the survey. One hundred twenty-five educators in the 10 high schools responded to the survey, 90 math instructors and 35 administrators. The DDDM diagnostic was secured from Dr. Scott McLeod of the University of Minnesota's School Technology Leadership Initiative. Dr. McLeod is conducting extensive research on the DDDM capacity of 11,000 educators in the state of Minnesota using the DDDM instrument. Five different mathematics student assessment indicators over a two-year time frame for each of the 10 participating schools were gathered from the high school principal in each of the schools. The composite scores from the assessment indicators in each school were correlated to the use of technology for DDDM capacity in each school to determine if a relationship existed between the two variables. Although this study utilized descriptive and correlation methodologies, it also resulted in apparent differences between teachers' and administrators' perceptions of their collective capacity for using technology for DDDM. Calculated means for each category of the DDDM survey instrument resulted in a higher average in every category for administrators than for teachers. This difference between teachers and administrators has implications for leadership and increasing the capacity for DDDM in Montana schools. There appears to be no significant relationships between student math assessment outcomes and using technology for DDDM capacity of educators. The research indicates that Montana ""AA"" educators are not using technology for DDDM to the degree that a positive relationship exists between student results and DDDM capacity. The study concludes that a closer examination of relationships between the use of technology for DDDM capacity and teacher-created formative assessments should be considered."

The park service is now considering closing irrigation to restore native plant communities and enhance Spread Creek fisheries and will need information on the extent of irrigation-created wetlands and how irrigation cessation would change the vegetative component of the ranch. The main objective of this study was to assess the relation between soil and vegetation characteristics of wetland community types at the ranch and to determine if any of the relationships could be used to differentiate between naturally occurring and irrigation created wetlands. Vegetation data were collected from transects centered on a soil pit at 28 randomly located sample points throughout the hayfield. Twenty-six of the 28 sample plots were classified as wetland based on criteria listed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling were used to analyze percent foliar cover, wetland index value (WIV), soil texture, percent organic matter, redox contrast and abundance, and depth to groundwater and soil saturation for each of the sampled points. The WIV and redox contrast had the greatest dissimilarity (DÂ²), 0.90, and 0.71 respectively across the hayfield. The other measured characteristics had DÂ² values ranging from 0.23 to 0.49 and were strongly correlated with the WIV and redox contrast measures. However, inclusion of these measures contributed little to the differences already identified. Categorical organization of WIV and redox measures indicated that naturally occurring wetlands could be differentiated from wetlands created by flood irrigation in former upland vegetation communities. Combining wetland index value and soil redox contrast suggests park managers could identify wetland community types likely to remain or transition following cessation of flood irrigation at the Elk Ranch. Additional testing at other GTNP sites will be necessary to test the broad application of this approach and refine the assessment categories.

The ability to alter the mechanical properties of biofilms could aid in the control of biofilm. The goal of this research project was to develop techniques for measuring the mechanical properties of biofilms so that the effects of chemical treatments could be assessed. Constitutive material models were developed and applied to assist in this effort to quantify the effects. Biofilms are viscoelastic in nature, therefore, rheological testing techniques were utilized for this research. Creep testing was performed on a parallel plate rheometer to determine biofilm mechanical properties. The rheometer is a mechanical device that can accurately measure and apply shear stress and strain on viscoelastic samples. The Burger material model closely approximated material behavior of most chemical treatments. This model was used for determining constitutive properties. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FRD1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis colony biofilms were used for testing. Several treatment methods were used to investigate their effect on biofilm mechanical properties. As a source of different cations, solutions of NaCl, FeCl3, AlCl3, MgCl2, CaCl2, FeCl2 were used for testing. Multivalent cation treatments stiffened the FRD1 biofilm, but weakened the S. epidermidis. Urea treatments weakened both biofilm species. Glutaraldehyde treatments weakened the FRD1 biofilm, but had little effect on the S. epidermidis. Several treatments - EDTA, Barquat, chlorine, antibiotics (rifampin, and ciprofloxacin) - weakened biofilms of both species. The effect of the same chemical treatment between the two species of biofilm sometimes had nearly opposite effects on the biofilms mechanical properties. This research illustrated that it is possible to alter the mechanical properties of biofilm through chemical addition. Further, there are significant differences between the ways that the material properties of biofilms of different species of bacteria will be affected by a chemical treatment. Finally, it was observed that the 4-parameter Burger model for constitutive mechanical properties of biofilms fit the vast majority of the collected data, so that this model proves useful in comparing properties of biofilms grown or treated under various conditions.

When obligations and expectations are met, this enhances trust within the school or district environment. School districts across America are influenced by labor statute, which drive negotiation processes between school boards and classroom teachers. The negotiations process in school districts today is predominately driven by collective bargaining statutes; however, a small number of states, categorized as Right to Work states, embrace other bargaining practices, such as the meet and confer process. The purpose of this comparative case study was to examine, describe and compare the importance of trust in school districts as it relates to the relationship between the union president and the superintendent bound by a collective bargaining process and the relationship between the union president and the superintendent not bound by the collective bargaining process. Also, this study examined the influence this relationship has on superintendent leadership behaviors. Two small, rural school districts, one in Montana and one in Wyoming, were the focus of this study. The research questions in the study are 1) What role does trust play in the relationship between teacher union presidents and the district superintendent in collective bargaining and non-collective bargaining districts? 2) What role does trust play in the relationship between union presidents and superintendents in Wyoming, who are not bound by a collective bargaining agreement? 3) What are the similarities and differences of the superintendent/union president relationship, as well as similarities and differences in superintendent leadership behavior, in these two types of districts? and 4) How do key stakeholders in a district perceive the influence the union president superintendent relationship has on the superintendent's leadership behavior? Study findings included the significant role relational trust plays in this working relationship. In addition, a key leadership behavior prevalent in the collective bargaining district was the trait of compromise. Another finding resulting from this study was the importance of the superintendent's ability to understand a district's definition and expectation to be considered trustworthy and then the overall ability to meet these expectations.

Teacher attitude and motivation were also determined. The students included in the project were from a 10th grade chemistry class, which included 25 students. Students completed a non-treatment unit in which data collection and analysis were completed without the use of technology. Digital data collection and analysis were then added to experiments and class activities during two treatment units. The digital data collection and analysis tools included data collection interfaces and probes, graphing software and simulations. The non-treatment unit and treatment units were then compared to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Students understanding of chemistry concepts, data analysis and conclusion making, and motivation increased slightly after the treatment units. Teacher attitude and motivation also showed an increase. This project showed that the use of digital data collection and analysis has positive effects on both the students and the teacher.

The study focuses on two primary questions; how does superintendent longevity provide a context through programs, relationships and culture that supports and enhances student achievement in schools and how do local conditions influence longevity of a superintendent? The purpose of this study is to analyze how superintendents with more than average longevity in one school district have influenced student achievement by providing a context through programs, relationships and culture that supports and enhances student achievement in their school. The other purpose is to determine how local conditions or characteristics of the community influence the longevity of the superintendent. Local reform efforts have focused on improvement of instruction at the teacher level, (Marzano, Pickering & Pollock 2001), at the building principal level (Marzano Waters & McNulty 2005), and improvement at the superintendent level (Waters and Marzano 2006) (Metcalfe 2008)(Myers 2011). It was also discovered that superintendent longevity has a positive correlation to student achievement. School improvement has also been recommended system wide (Togneri & Anderson, 2003) (Senge 2006) (Fullan 2010). While existing research provides evidence that superintendent longevity influences student achievement, little is known as to how superintendent longevity contributes to student achievement. This case study included three Montana school districts that exhibited positive longitudinal student achievement gains over a 6 year period and whose superintendent had been in the district at least 8 years. Data from interviews of the superintendent, school board, principals and teachers, observations and document review was included in this study. Themes for each district were identified along with cross case themes common to all three districts. Four findings were determined that answer the research questions. The findings suggest that hiring, professional development and removing distractions so teachers can focus on teaching were the link between superintendent longevity and student achievement. Local conditions that promoted a superintendent's longevity in a district were a supportive school board and supportive community.

The model in [34] is extended - growth and detachment is added, making the new model more interesting in applications. The crucial feature of our model is that cells are able to enter an adapted resistant state when challenged with antimicrobials (adaptation). We study this model in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. Existence and uniqueness of solutions is shown as well as the existence and non-uniqueness of steady-state solutions. Another question of interest is the effective dosing of biocide, i.e. exploring dosing strategies that could minimize the number of living cells or biofilm thickness. Constant and periodic dosing regimes are modeled numerically and studied analytically. One of our main results is that on and off dosing is significantly better than the other dosing types. The model presented in this dissertation contributes to a better understanding of one of the resistant mechanisms in biofilms.

Many abandoned mine sites in Montana have been reclaimed, however, little post-reclamation monitoring has been performed, and the effectiveness of reclamation has not been quantified. The goal of this project was to quantify the effectiveness of reclamation at three sites in Jefferson County, Montana based on soil suitability for sustaining plant growth. Vegetation and soil studies were executed using a stratified random sampling design. Vegetation measurements included canopy cover using Daubenmire cover classes, above ground biomass, and species richness/diversity. Co-located soil samples were excavated in increments to a depth of 60 cm, and determinations of pH, electrical conductivity, nutrients, soluble, and total metal levels were made. Canopy cover estimates ranged from 0-120% and biomass production estimates ranged from 0-4583 kg ha-1. Differences in species richness and diversity were observed between sample strata. The chemical properties of the soil varied greatly, with pH values ranging from 2.08 to 7.63, and soluble metal values ranging from <0.1 to1001 mg l-1 for Zn, .02 to 20.81 mg l-1 for Cu, <.01 to 7.39 mg l-1 for Cd, <.05 to 12.26 mg l-1 for As, and <.1 to 7.6 mg l-1 for Pb. Sum of total metal and arsenic (As, Cu, Pb, and Zn) concentrations ranged from 133 to 81448 mg kg-1. Associations between vegetation and soil chemistry were determined using correlation. Significant correlations between vegetation attributes and soil chemistry were found. These results indicate that reclamation at the selected sites was moderately effective in reducing human and environment risk of exposure to harmful contaminants. There are concerns with upward migration of contaminants, and the sustainability of plant communities at all sites within the study. Elevated levels of residual metals and arsenic, as well as low pH conditions may have a deleterious effect on the long-term stability of the reclamation at these sites.

In the first part of this dissertation, the role that the metastasis-associated laminin binding protein or LBP plays in the spread and development of cancer was investigated. Functional domains of LBP were delineated by limited proteolysis, overexpressed, and then assayed for their ability to bind to the previously identified in vivo binding partner laminin. These assays demonstrated that, at least under the conditions used in this assay, binding to laminin was localized to domain 137-230, a region that encompasses a previously identified binding site known as Peptide G. This protein, like the full-length recombinant laminin binding protein, aggregated under conditions used for nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and therefore could not be analyzed with this technique. Contrary to previous findings on a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 205-229, this sequence within the context of the 200-295 construct demonstrated no laminin binding activity. Furthermore, the peptide lacked the predicted alpha-helical content and tertiary structure as ascertained by nuclear magnetic resonance and by circular dichroism spectroscopy. A potential role for the disorder exhibited by this region of LBP is proposed, and suggests possible new functions for the laminin binding protein in angiogenesis. NosL, the subject of the second part of this thesis, is a highly conserved copper(I) binding lipoprotein encoded by the nitrous oxide reductase (nos) gene cluster of denitrifying bacteria. To identify functional features and structural homologues of this protein, the structure of apo NosL Was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The high-resolution structure of NosL consists of one four-strand antiparallel beta sheet, one three strand antiparallel beta sheet and two alpha-helices organized in a twisted butterfly-like fold that is structurally homologous to MerB, an alkyl mercury lyase. Chemical perturbation mapping performed on the copper(I)=protein defined regions of NosL potentially involved in copper binding, and thus allowed preliminary identification of the copper-binding ligand Met 109.

This biostimulatory effect may be mediated by pheromones produced by bulls that stimulate physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) and/or -adrenal (HPA) axes of cows. In Experiment 1, the hypothesis tested was that the biostimulatory effect of bulls is associated with adrenal regulation and/or function in anestrous cows. The biostimulatory effect of bulls was associated with mean concentrations of cortisol in postpartum cows. Experiment 2 was designed to determine if acute (5-h daily) bull exposure alters characteristics of patterns of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations in postpartum, anestrous cows. Cows exposed acutely to bulls exhibited fewer pulses of cortisol and more frequent pulses of LH than cows exposed to steers. However, it was not known if these changes were related to resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, anestrous cows. Experiment 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that patterns of cortisol concentrations are altered by continuous, 24-h daily, bull exposure, before and after resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, anestrous cows. Continuous bull exposure decreased cortisol pulse frequency before cows resumed ovarian cycling activity. Experiment 4 tested the hypothesis that the overall shape of patterns of cortisol and/or LH concentrations may differ between cows exposed acutely to bulls or steers in Experiment 2. Cows exposed acutely to bulls had more uneven patterns of LH concentrations than cows exposed to steers and as patterns of cortisol concentrations became smoother, patterns of LH become more uneven in cows exposed acutely to bulls. In Experiment 5, the hypothesis tested was that interval to resumption of ovarian cycling activity may depend upon duration of daily bull exposure. Cows resumed ovarian cycling activity sooner as duration of daily bull exposure increased. In conclusion, as duration of daily bull exposure increases, the biostimulatory effect of bulls alters activity of the HPA axis and this change may facilitate or support the function of the HPO axis and accelerate resumption of ovarian cycling activity in primiparous, postpartum, suckled, anestrous cows.

The dependent variables were total time (minutes/day) occurring at sedentary (TS), light (T L) and > or = moderate (T MV) intensity PA, and the sum of activity energy expenditure (AEE; kcals/day) occurring at a light (AEE L), > or = moderate intensity (AEE MV) and from total AEE for a monitoring day (AEE T). Intraclass correlation coefficients for each monitoring day (ICC DAY) were calculated to examine reliability of all dependent variables for both AM locations, over bout durations of 1-, 5-, and 10-minutes. Excluding T L measured by the wrist AM location, ICC DAY values for all variables decreased as bout duration increased from 1- to 10-minutes. The number of monitoring days to reach an ICC DAY > or = 0.80 for AEE L, AEE MV, AEE T, T L and T MV across all three bout durations was higher for hip- versus wrist-worn AM, and ranged from 2-26 versus 2-10 days, respectively. Conversely, then number of monitoring days to reliably measure TS was lower for hip AM (4-5 days) versus the wrist AM (6-8 days) locations. Among all the variables, T L had the largest range of necessary monitoring days to reach an ICC DAY > or = 0.80, 7-10 and 6-26 days across all bout durations for the wrist and hip, respectively. Further comparison of the dependent variables by day type revealed that only T L measured at the wrist had significantly different means on weekdays versus weekends (pvalue < or = 0.001) across all bout durations. While not significant, mean values for T MV, AEE MV, and AEE T measured by both hip- and wrist-worn AMs, were higher on weekdays than on weekends. In summary, reliability of time and AEE PA variables was dependent on bout duration and AM location. Generally, to reliability measure free-living PA in adolescents wrist-worn AMs required fewer monitoring days than hip-worn AMs.	['life sciences', 'physiology', 'exercise', 'biology', 'health', 'medicine', 'human biology', 'science']

Written dialogue is the means by which this interaction takes place. This study examined the effects of a training program designed for facilitators in the e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS) program, which provides online induction for beginning science and mathematics teachers. The training was designed to improve the quality of dialogue among participants in the program. The intervention consisted of three components: 1) an online training institute prior to beginning of the program year, 2) placement of facilitators in positions within the discussion areas of the program, and 3) ongoing online support for practicing facilitators. Three examinations were conducted in this mixed-method study. First, preintervention program dialogue was quantitatively compared to post-intervention program dialogue through use of a program-specific rubric to code program discussions. Second, case studies were conducted to determine how the training affected the practices of seven program facilitators and which components of the training effected change or growth. Third, pre and post intervention surveys were administered to all participants of the training to obtain their perceptions of their development as a result of the intervention. Comparison of dialogue before and after the intervention indicated a significant improvement in dialogue quality in the discussion areas of the program. Case studies of facilitators' practices revealed areas of the training that impacted the skills and strategies that facilitators used in efforts to foster increased and improved dialogue. Survey results indicated that participants gained a better understanding of what constituted quality dialogue in terms of the eMSS program and how better to foster quality dialogue in an online environment. Components of the training found to be effective in helping facilitators to foster dialogue improvement were: 1) focus on program goals and vision, 2) focus on the nature of online communication, 3) practice with the analysis of actual program dialogue, 4) practice in composing effective online messages. Implications for online facilitators are discussed and recommendations are made for designing training for facilitators to work in computer-mediated conferences.

The objectives of the current work were to correlate the spatial distribution of microbial populations with changes in aqueous geochemistry and mineralogy in a unique Yellowstone National Park (YNP) geothermal spring, and to cultivate thermophilic microorganisms with phylogenetic and metabolic relevance to spring conditions. The geothermal spring (hereafter referenced as Joseph's Coat Spring -JC3) contains the highest reported concentrations of arsenic, antimony and thiosulfate of any geothermal feature studied in YNP. A suite of analytical and molecular approaches including aqueous geochemical and dissolved gas analysis, solid phase characterization, energetic calculations, microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequence distribution were utilized to correlate specific microbial populations with biogeochemical processes. Predominant geochemical changes observed within the outflow channel were disappearance of methane, dissolved sulfide and ingassing of dissolved oxygen. Oxidation of arsenite was significant within the outflow channel despite the slow ingassing rates of dissolved oxygen. Microbial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined at locations in the source pool and within the outflow channel. Shifts in microbial community structure were observed as a function of distance from the source. Source pool pyritic phases and Sb and S rich sediments were dominated by Geothermobacterium, Desulfurococcus, and Thermofilum-like sequences. Shifts in microbial community structure were observed within the outflow channel including appearance of Aquificales and Thermales sequences down gradient. Cultivation strategies based on spring geochemistry and energetic analysis were successful in isolating two novel thermophilic Crenarchaeota with high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to those determined within the spring sediments. An anaerobic, heterotrophic, S-respiring Thermofilum-like strain (WP28t) exhibits characteristics consistent with spring geochemistry, and confirms the importance of microbial reduction of elemental S in this spring. Detailed geochemical characterization and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences will continue to guide cultivation strategies for isolating novel microorganisms. This research indicates the importance of correlating microbial community analysis with geochemical measurements as an integrated approach for understanding the primary carbon and energy sources that link microbial populations with specific geochemical processes.

In Montana, outreach designed to address migrant worker health care access disparity includes community clinics that provide bilingual and culturally-sensitive, preventive care. The focus of this study was to (a) describe the characteristics of the diabetic migrant population who receive services at Montana Migrant Council clinics and (b) determine which information obtained during the patient visit is most often recorded. Methods: This non-experimental, descriptive, cross-sectional study applied secondary analysis to existing de-identified data from the Patient Electronic Care System (PECS) database managed by the Montana Migrant Council (MMC). Sample size (n = 30) was determined by the diabetes registry criteria established in the MMC Clinician's Manual. Results: Although 151 diabetic migrant patients were present in the state of Montana in 2008, only 30 were enrolled in the database and received primary care from MMC during the year. Characteristics such as age, gender, body mass index, blood pressure, and baseline laboratory testing were used to describe this population of patients. Of the 30 patients in the PECS database, 53% were female, 84% ranged in age from 30-64 years old, 60% were Hispanic, and 93% were uninsured. Ten percent of these patients had recorded blood pressures >140/90 and over half had co-existing hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Sixteen percent had neuropathy and/or nephropathy, 23% had microalbuminuria, and 7% had retinopathy. All 30 patients in the registry had a dental exam, nutrition education, a foot exam, substance abuse screening, a lipid panel, and a hemoglobin A1C drawn. Forty percent of PECS diabetes patients had an A1C less than 7.0. Fifty-six percent of patients had HDL cholesterol less than the desired 45mg/dL. Conclusion: Although results of this study agreed with findings in the literature, the MMC population possess unique characteristics including a high percentage of female registrants, a high number of Caucasian registrants, and a high number of annual visits (average of 10 within the PECS registry).

The study examined indicators as identified in the literature and as identified through a pilot survey given to students at the Blackfeet Community College. A literature review yielded little research on student classroom retention in tribal colleges. The population for this study was n=113 students enrolled in core level academic courses. These students responded to a survey developed specifically for this study and were subsequently tracked through the semester to determine academic success or failure. The survey responses were then analyzed to determine which student indicators or groups of indicators were indicative of student academic success or failure. The significant findings of this study revealed that students who were academically unsuccessful were less likely to re-enroll in the next year. Specific indicators were identified to suggest that students who had not completed high school or their GED were at-risk. Male students without school-age children are more likely to be academically unsuccessful than female students without school-age children and female students with school-age children are more likely to be academically unsuccessful than male students with school-age children. Also identified as at-risk were students who did not drive themselves to campus.

The adoption of artificial insemination by the equine industry has been inconsistent across breed registries and varied over time. The question arises as to why any registry would resist the introduction of a technology that lowers the cost of production. Identification of the characteristics that influence the decision by a breed registry to place restrictions on the use of artificial insemination will provide economic reasons to explain why the restrictions exist. Various explanations are hypothesized to provide a basis for empirical models. Regression analysis is run to test for the significance of the following factors; opportunistic behavior, monopoly power, and the importance of relative versus absolute performance. It is established that all three factors contribute to a registry's decision whether or not to impose restrictions on the use of artificial insemination. There are two separate conclusions drawn from the results. Where opportunistic behavior (i.e. cheating) generates rewards not otherwise attainable, artificial insemination will be restricted. Where relative performance matters and a breed is able to exert monopoly power, artificial insemination will be restricted.

Understanding the interaction between clouds and radiation is necessary for accurate models that predict future climate and weather changes. The present cloud instruments are either zenithviewing, single-pixel instruments that calculate cloud amount using Taylor's hypothesis (spatial statistics are equal to temporal statistics), which do not work under certain atmospheric conditions, or are imagers that operate in the visible spectrum, thereby operating only in the daytime. Other imaging instruments use completely different techniques for daytime and nighttime detection of clouds and have problems detecting clouds at sunrise and sunset. The Infrared Cloud Imager (ICI), a ground based, thermal infrared imager was developed with funding from the Communications Research Laboratory (CRL), Japan, to provide continuous 24-hour cloud measurement without difference in daytime or nighttime sensitivity. The ICI is a spatially resolving instrument that measures the downwelling atmospheric radiance in the 8-14 aem region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The data collected are used to compute spatial and temporal cloud statistics. Although the ICI was initially developed to measure Arctic clouds, it has been successfully deployed in both Barrow, Alaska in the Spring of 2002 and in Lamont, Oklahoma (mid-latitude plains) in Spring 2003. I have developed algorithms for processing the ICI data based on Microwave Radiometer (MWR) water vapor data, for identifying and classifying clouds, and have demonstrated that ICI is capable of determining cloud statistics. From the radiative transfer analysis of the ICI data, weekly and monthly cloud statistics show a general trend of mostly clear and/or mostly cloudy skies with very small transition periods. Sky cover histograms from Oklahoma show predominantly thick clouds in March and thin clouds in April with a significant amount of variability in sky condition. The comparison of cloud statistics obtained from the entire ICI image and from a single pixel in the ICI image illustrates that zenith-viewing instruments generally tend to underestimate cloudiness. The correlation between ICI percent cloudiness (using different thresholds for Oklahoma data) with the Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) cloudiness has also been analyzed.

This study investigated the effects of dichotomous keys with analogies on college students' understanding of concepts. Twenty adult students enrolled in one section of my Grade 12 equivalent biology course participated. A combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection tools were used to evaluate my intervention's impacts on understanding, long-term memory, and higher-order thinking skills. Data from the three treatment units were compared to one nontreatment unit during which only existing teaching methods were employed. Paired two-tailed t-tests were used to quantify any differences observed between the preunit, postunit, and delayed unit assessment scores. Student-generated works, and interview data obtained from low-, middle-, and high-achieving students, were compared to allow for triangulation of the data. Other forms of data collection were used to determine the effects of dichotomous keys with analogies on biology students' attitudes and motivation. Students' written comments on pretreatment and posttreatment attitude scales were compared to identify trends and outliers, while responses to Yes/No questions were quantified using chi-square analyses. In addition, teacher journaling and classroom observations by a peer observer were employed. The effects on my own teaching, time management, and attitude were assessed through the use of teacher attitude scales, journaling, and peer observations. The data indicate no significant improvement in students' overall conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking skills following the treatment period, but significant benefits were observed with respect to concept retention. Both lower-order thinking skills, and student and teacher attitudes and motivation, yielded mixed results. One group of students thrived during the prolonged use of dichotomous keys, while the other group became frustrated with, and disengaged from, its highly structured format.

One of the reasons why students are not successful in entry level biology courses (usually required for majors) is that their high school biology course failed to thoroughly prime them for college level science courses. In this study, I examine the knowledge gap between high school and college biology courses and perspectives of students, high school teachers and professors. In particular, the emphasis of this research project is on the transfer of subject content knowledge. To measure the level of student preparedness, I used a survey/pretest hybrid composed of several background questions about students' high school biology experience as well as questions designed to test student understanding of fundamental biological questions. The online survey was administered to over 3000 students in 42 randomly selected universities across six geographical regions of the United States during the first week of their introductory biology course in college. An exit poll was used towards the end of the semester to obtain student perspectives regarding how well prepared they had been for the college biology course they were about to complete. Online questionnaires and phone interviews provided insight into high school teacher and professor perspectives regarding the gap in biology knowledge transfer. The low average score on the pre-test indicates that high school graduates are poorly prepared for college biology in terms of fundamental concept knowledge. Professors agreed with this and most students surveyed at the end of their first college biology course felt that their high school biology experience had not adequately prepared them for college biology or that their teachers or the curriculum they followed could have done more to prepare them. Findings from this study also show that a lack of communication between secondary and higher education biology instructors is an important factor contributing to the misalignment between high school and college biology. Increased vertical communication between the two levels of education would enable secondary school teachers to better prepare their students for the transition to introductory college biology and give professors a more accurate idea of the expectations they can hold their students to.

Males and females were shown to prefer different learning modalities and in-class performance varied with the differentiation technique employed. Students who showed an equal preference for more than one learning style consistently out preformed their peers who only preferred one modality. Additionally, a subpopulation of students was identified based on their learning style preferences. Interestingly, these kinesthetic learners skewed the data and a kinesthetic trend was noted. Kinesthetic male learners on individualized education plans (IEPs) were also found to be underserved in the traditional classroom. Female intrapersonal learners and male kinesthetic learners were found to be at odds throughout the study. Overall, this investigation revealed little difference between the genders with regard to classroom dynamics and class appeal. In general, classroom dynamics and class appeal were improved as a result of the differentiation.

69667	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2435	The effects of laboratory-based activities on student attitudes toward science	The purpose of this action research was to study the effects of laboratory-based activities on student attitudes toward science. For the purpose of this study, fifth grade students were taught science over a five month period which included the regular science curriculum for the school district, labs from the science series, and additional labs corresponding to the topics in the curriculum that were developed by the teacher or other professionals. Students were given questionnaires and surveys at the beginning and end of the five month period. Surveys and questionnaires included questions about favorite subjects, what was best about science, and how the student understands science. Comments on what kind of lab/activity was most beneficial to increase understanding and what type of lab or activity was preferred were examined. Pre and post data were compared to determine whether or not student attitude toward science changed after the five month period. Although students entered this fifth grade classroom with a good attitude toward science, there was a noticeable increase in science attitude in regard to favorite subject and understanding of science at the end of the time period. The importance of using labs/activities to inspire and increase understanding of science in fifth grade was evident not only in survey results but from statements students made as well.

The material types are identified in the Montana Supplemental Specifications as crushed base course (CBC, 1.5 to 2-inch maximum particle sizes) and crushed top surfacing (CTS, 0.75-inch maximum particle size). All aggregates were open-graded and contained relatively few fines. Results from R-value tests and direct shear (DS) tests performed on large samples (12-in by 12-in) indicate the CBC aggregates generally exhibited higher strength and stiffness than the CTS aggregates. Drainage capacity was quantified by conducting multiple saturated constant head permeability (k) tests on 10-inch-diameter samples of each material type. Hydraulic properties of the materials examined in this study did not correlate well with aggregate type, but were found to correlate with pore properties. The fine fraction void ratio was correlated to k. It is derived from gradation and density, both parameters that are commonly tested in roadway construction projects. This could allow roadway designers to incorporate an estimate of k into their design, and could also allow quick comparisons of aggregate samples and the development of aggregate specifications. X-ray CT scanning was performed to acquire pore size distributions of the materials. No differences between aggregate types could be discerned from the pore size distributions, but a strong correlation between the pore size of 80% passing and k was discovered. Additionally, an equation was presented for thresholding 2D X-ray CT soil images. This equation could be applied in future studies to help reduce the subjectivity of the thresholding process.

Accurate forecasts of these prices are valuable to buyers and sellers that trade in the cash and futures markets. Rational distributed lag models of monthly prices from June 1977 to May 1984 for Kansas City No. 1 Hard Red Winter Wheat, Minneapolis Dark Northern Spring Wheat, Portland No. 1 Soft White Wheat, Kansas City flour, and retail bread prices are made to evaluate the economic or structural factors influencing price. Multivariate autoregressive-integrated-moving average error (ARIMA) models are also used to compare with the structural models price forecasting ability. Rational lags are estimated using a nonlinear least squares algorithm, incorporating the specification of nonstochastic difference equations so that the disturbance process is divorced from the systematic portion of the difference equations. Certain economic factors are found to be significant in Influencing the prices of wheat, flour, and bread. Partial derivatives and price flexibilities are calculated to estimate the short, intermediate, and long-run adjustments of prices in the structural models. In the structural models total wheat stocks are the most Influential variable in determining wheat prices and the price of wheat was most influential in the flour price equation. Flour price is highly significant in influencing retail bread price, with the secular effects of income increasing over time. The price forecasting abilities of the structural and ARIMA are found to be relatively close when comparing the Root Mean Square Errors and the adjusted coefficients of determination.

Most of the studies of this problem assume fixed shifts and that demand is evenly distributed over the day. These assumptions can reduce utilization of nursing resources. In this thesis, we present a less constrained formulation of the nurse scheduling problem that minimizes staffing and preference costs while allowing intraday demand variability and staggered shifts. We developed a problem generator to create random instances and identified the most significant problem characteristics by preliminary runs. Varying and fixed shift policies were compared based on optimal solutions obtained with CPLEX. We demonstrate that nurse utilization can be improved if shift start times are allowed to vary for some types of intraday demand variability. Additionally, nurse pools with varied shift lengths were shown to improve the utilization.	['time management', 'scheduling', 'management']

The patterns of survivor abuse stories are unearthed through both social science research and feminist literary criticism. By drawing connections between the two novels and their connection to the larger world of feminist issues, the argument is made that these and other popular novels are fruitful for cultural analysis because popular fiction reaches far more readers than academic texts and are thus able to initiate social change on a larger scale.

These biopolymers have a histidine residue, which is a potent quencher of tryptophan fluorescence, positioned four amino acids away from tryptophan. Experiments assumed that when folding occurs the fluorescence of tryptophan will be quenched by histidine due to the formation of an alpha helix. The reliability of folding and unfolding rate constants determined by tryptophan fluorescence has been called into question by several computational studies. A method to calculate the electron transfer matrix element was developed for different donor/acceptor systems. This method shows that the electron transfer matrix element is sensitive to orientation at close distances and that it does not follow a simple exponential decay with distance. This thesis improved the methods developed by Callis and coworker by conducting 100 ns long simulations for single tryptophan proteins and by modifying the calculation of the fluorescence quantum yield to account for heterogeneity in the calculated electron transfer rates. In addition the method was extended to calculate electron transfer rate constants for histidine quenching by conducting 1 microsecond long simulations of HP-35 and WH5. Calculated tryptophan fluorescence quantum yields for the single tryptophan proteins show better agreement with experiment than was previously reported. Simulations for HP-35 and WH5 indicate that the ability of histidine to quench the fluorescence of tryptophan is surprisingly controlled by the energy gap dependence on the distance that separates them. The energy gap dependence on this distance arises from water solvation around histidine. At large distances this solvation decreases the ability of histidine to accept an electron from tryptophan. Different tryptophan/histidine rotamers control this distance. Even when HP-35 is completely folded much of the time histidine does not quench tryptophan fluorescence contrary to the idea that histidine is only close when HP-35 is folded. The calculated fluorescence quantum yield is sensitive to the distribution of close and far conformations and the rate of exchange between these two conformations. This sensitivity gives credibility to the folding/unfolding rates derived from tryptophan fluorescence quantum yields.

Governmental and private institutions are promoting adoption of soil conservation practices such as construction of slow formation terraces, yet they lack accurate estimates of the private and social benefits and costs of these investments. The objective of this thesis is to provide a better understanding of the economics of terrace investments by (1) developing a method to conduct a sensitivity analysis of an integrated assessment model designed for the agricultural production systems in Peru, and (2) conducting an economic analysis of the effects of terraces on productivity and their economic implications. The Tradeoff Analysis software was used to implement an integrated assessment model and to conduct a sensitivity analysis of terrace investments in a watershed in northern Peru. Key parameters in the analysis are: erosion and terrace effects on productivity; interest rates; terrace maintenance and investment costs; and time to achieve terrace maturity. The analysis shows that the proportion of fields on which terraces are a profitable investment can be highly sensitive to key parameters, thus demonstrating the importance of sensitivity analysis to understand and interpret policy implications derived from integrated assessment models. The analysis also verifies the hypothesis that physical and economic heterogeneity are important determinants of terrace profitability. Terraces were found to be most profitable on more steeply sloped fields, implying that farmers have incentives to invest in terraces where both private and social returns are the highest.

Despite the variety of cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors influencing student learning within and among American Indian communities, common characteristics of learning styles and effective teaching practices have been identified. Though the wording in each definition varies, research based on a variety of theoretical frameworks and using a variety of methodologies and instruments suggests that among American Indian students, there is a tendency to learn better when the following three strategies are used: contextualization, modeling and demonstration, and joint productive activity. Despite the general agreement in education research that the beliefs that teachers hold about mathematics teaching and learning greatly impact their instructional decisions in the classroom, few, if any, of those studies have examined teachers' beliefs regarding effective strategies for American Indians in mathematics. The main purpose of this study was to add the voices of four teachers to the research community conversation about effective teaching strategies for American Indians in mathematics. Two elementary and two high school teachers from two schools in Montana were selected for this study for their experience with and commitment to the mathematics education of American Indian students. Two are American Indians and two are White. Using a combination of classroom observations and a modification of videoclip interviews, the beliefs of the four teachers were identified with particular focus on the three teaching strategies mentioned above. The study shows that teachers' definitions of research-based strategies often differ from those intended by the research. Teachers' views about these strategies seemed to be idiosyncratic to individual teachers and appeared to be shaped by multiple lenses. In this study, some of those lenses emerged including, among others, school structures and teachers' cultural backgrounds. In light of the results of the study, future efforts for constructive bi-directional communication between the research community and practitioners are recommended.

What began with an attempt to document a dying/evolving culture in Flaherty's Nanook of the North led to a century of debate about how closely documentary film could come to achieving the ultimate goal of representing our historical and social world accurately, objectively, and truthfully. The stem cell research debate has produced three documentaries that illustrate two models of filmmaking process: engaged filmmaking and non-engaged filmmaking. Within these two models, the filmmaker may utilize certain aesthetic techniques of vision and voice that reveal subjective manipulation. I intend to show how the rhetoric of the filmmaker presides over the content even when he presumes to maintain an objective stance.

Communism was distorted by human nature to create a powerful and oppressive tyranny by which many suffered in Eastern Europe. Architecture was and remains one of the primary ways to display power. It can oppress the masses by raising fear and suspicion from the governing as well as from the governed. In the mid 60's Romania gained autonomy from Russia and began to practice its own form of communism. The power of propaganda remained, creative individualism perished, and the commune prevailed. The private domicile was assigned to the individual based on the number of family members. But in reality the quality of one's home was purely based on ties to the communist party. Most people had to give up old family homes and move in ""bloc"" system apartment buildings. These structures were built on a grid with the efficiency of a machine. Expanded within the grid were the cells of private life. Effort was not given to comfort or individuality. Although these structures have a resemblance to the projects of New York there is a certain nostalgia for these concrete neighborhoods. They represent a time when people were drawn together against the greater evil and a time when children took first steps. It was also a time of invisible resources such as food and heat, yet Bucharest would be a different city without these neighborhoods. The banishment of individuality in public and private life created a social change in Romanian culture. Whether it became an underground affair to express individuality, spirituality, homosexuality or whether its suppression abolished certain traits in the Romanian people is of great interest to me. I would like to focus on one neighborhood in Bucharest, Romania which is comprised of the communist style apartment buildings in order to figure out what course of action would be most suitable for bringing back the sense of pride and identity in peoples' living spaces. Should the buildings be renovated, destroyed or would a community center be more effective?"

This study explains the objectives, principles and developments of the CAP. Wheat and barley acreage response under the CAP is examined for eight production regions in the UK using time series-cross section data for period 1975-1995. This is the first study to examine the individual effects of prices and yields on cereals acreage in the UK separately. Attention is focused on alternative models of price and yield expectations. The performance of the resulting alternative price and yield forecast variables in estimation models are then compared. The study also examines the impacts of revenue uncertainty and recent changes in the CAP, including the set aside programs of 1988 and 1992, on wheat and barley planted acreage. Models in which expected prices were forecasted using ARIMA models and expected yields were forecasted by nonlinear time trend models provided most satisfactory results. The empirical findings indicate that wheat and barley acreage response is mainly explained by changes in the ratio of expected wheat yields to expected barley yields, by changes in relative prices and by variables that account for the set aside programs. The increasing gap between the wheat intervention price and threshold price together with developments in bread-making and wheat-washing industry also have had a significant positive impact on acreage planted to wheat and a significant negative impact on acreage planted to barley. The results further indicate that the CAP set aside programs have had a larger negative impact on barley acreage than on wheat acreage. Barley acreage planting decisions have been also more sensitive to changes in expected prices and revenue uncertainty than wheat acreage planting decisions.

The theorem has been analyzed in the literature under the assumption that the prices of the goods are exogenous. This thesis presents a spatial equilibrium model that drops this restriction. The comparative statics analysis developed in this thesis does not support the theorem proposition in the general case. The theorem is then tested empirically on U.S. hard wheat exports. Transport costs, represented by ocean grain freight rates, are not found to have a significant influence on the average quality of U.S. wheat exports for the group of importing countries with a high per capita incomes that have not received U.S. export subsidies. However, transport costs are shown to be positively related with the average quality of U.S. wheat exports for the group of low-income importing countries. Additionally, it is shown that there exists an inverse relationship between the relative price of high quality wheat and the average quality of U.S. wheat exports for high-income countries.

Recent advances in ecological theory reveal that biodiversity at regional to continental scales is strongly influenced by available energy (i.e. factors influencing vegetative growth such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, soil fertility). We hypothesized bird species richness (BSR) exhibits a positive or unimodal relationship with energy across landscapes and the relationship between energy and BSR within a landscape is positive in energy limited landscapes and flat or decreasing in energy rich landscapes. Additionally, we hypothesized that structural complexity explains a lower percentage of the variation in BSR in energy limited environments and higher percentage in energy rich environments and that the slope of the relationship between structural complexity and BSR is greatest in energy rich environments. Ours is the first study to test the relative influence of energy and vegetation structure on BSR at local scales, and to offer predictive theory on how these influences differ across energy gradients. We sampled bird communities and vegetation across a matrix of seral stages and biophysical settings at each of 5 landscapes. We analyzed the response of BSR to structural complexity and energy covariates at each landscape. We found that (1) BSR had a unimodal relationship with available energy across the PINW region, (2) the landscape-scale relationships between energy and BSR were positive or unimodal in energy limited locations and were flat or negative in energy rich locations, (3) forest structural complexity explained more of the variation in bird species richness in energy rich landscapes, and (4) the slope of the relationship between forest structural complexity and BSR was steepest in energy limited locations and negative in energy rich locations. In energy rich locations, forest managers will likely increase landscape-scale diversity by providing all seral-stages and a range of forest structural complexity. In low-energy environments, biodiversity will likely be maximized by managing local high-energy hotspots judiciously and adjusting harvest intensities in other locations to compensate for slower regeneration rates.

However despite this attention, many critics from inside and outside the higher education community do not believe preparation programs have gone far enough or have made the necessary changes to insure that principal candidates gain the skills and knowledge necessary for the demands of leadership in contemporary schools. Bandura (1997) found that people's self-efficacy, the judgments of their personal capabilities, rather than their actual skills and knowledge, is what drives them to achieve goals they set for themselves. Since little research exists that examines principal self-efficacy, or how preparation programs contribute to self-efficacy, preparation program faculty have limited understanding about how program elements positively influence self-efficacy development. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to: examine principals' perceptions of the effectiveness of their preparation programs, determine the underlying factors that contributed to principal self-efficacy, understand how program elements contributed to self-efficacy, and suggest ways that preparation programs might more purposefully design experiences that promote self-efficacy development in aspiring principals. Quantitative questionnaires were sent to 538 practicing principals in Montana to rate the effectiveness of their preparation programs and their principal self-efficacy. Principals who rated their programs as effective and who also rated themselves as self-efficacious were chosen for qualitative interviews to determine how preparation program elements contributed to their self-efficacy development. The findings suggest that: (a) four factors - leadership experiences, motivation, authentic learning experiences, and self regulation contributed to self-efficacy development of aspiring principals; (b) self-efficacy was developed through experiences that caused relationship building and learning from others, authentic experiences working with others and persistence and perseverance; (c) preparation programs can more purposefully create efficacy building experiences through: designing experiences that cause students to master the art of working with other people, developing internship and field experiences of breadth and depth, encouraging principal candidates to obtain prior leadership experiences, and to monitor students in ""grow your own"" programs to insure that loss of self-efficacy does not occur as a result of broken relationships."

Sampling during the darkness of winter is logistically difficult and expensive, and my study is an important step towards understanding the year-round ecology of the dry valley lakes. Bacterial productivity, measured as protein synthesis and DNA replication, and bacterial cell numbers were measured 10-12 times between October 2007 and April 2008 in Lakes Fryxell (FRX) and the east and west lobes of Lake Bonney (ELB and WLB). Lake Fryxell was the most productive (bacterial) lake on average by an order of magnitude (average = 1.24 mg C m -Â²d -Â¹; range = 0.00 to 3.29 mg C m -Â²d -Â¹), and also contained the greatest bacterial biomass (~10 â¶ cells ml -Â¹) by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. If bacterial production were directly linked to organic carbon supplied by photosynthetic primary production, a decrease in bacterial production would be expected during the sunset; however, no statistically significant change in bacterial production (a=0.05) was observed during the summer-fall transition. A distinct decoupling of bacterial protein production and DNA replication was detected in FRX and ELB of the lakes as the season progressed, and was present in WLB throughout the season, indicating either a shift towards a lower growth-rate in response to decreasing light or nutrient supply, or a mechanism for dealing with the perennially low temperatures, low light, and nutrient poor conditions in the lakes. Overall, it appears that bacterial communities remain active during the darkness of winter, when the lakes enter a period of ""net heterotrophy"", which cannot be sustained unless the carbon balance of the TV lakes is reset by climatic events."

This thesis first presents an introduction to the NMR experimental concepts and data analysis. Several experimental systems are then described in detail: biological reduction of uranium; biofilm growth in porous media; and solutions and gels of alginate, a polymer molecule commonly found in the biofilm polymeric matrix. Bioremediation of heavy metal contaminants such as uranium around nuclear waste storage sites is an important environmental problem. Uranyl (UO 2 Â²+) is soluble in water, while uraninite (UO 2) precipitates as nanoparticles. Certain types of bacteria are able to use uranium as the electron acceptor and reduce uranyl ions to uraninite. The experiments presented used a solution of uranyl ions that was reduced by a sulfur reducing bacteria and were studied using images and relaxation measurements. The growth of biofilms in the subsurface may also be used for bioremediation. Biofilms form when bacteria attach to surfaces and then produce and live within a polymeric matrix known as the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Experiments were done on a biofilm grown through the pore structure of a model bead pack. During the biofilm growth, displacement-relaxation correlation experiments were performed which were able to separate the biofilm phase from the bulk fluid phase using relaxation information. The results presented show that during biofilm growth very little convective flow occurs through the biofilm phase, while pore clogging causes channeling that increases the flow through non-biofilm filled pores and increases hydrodynamic dispersion. The EPS matrix of a biofilm contains DNA, proteins, and biologically produced polymers. Some biofilms such as those produced by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa contain the polymer alginate. Three biologically produced alginates were compared: alginate produced by algae, alginate produced by P. aeruginosa FRD1153, and alginate produced by P. aeruginosa FRD1. A diffusive reaction gelation process was used to produce heterogeneous gels which were analyzed both during and after gelation. Homogeneous gels and solutions were studied using relaxation dispersion techniques. Differences in hydrogen exchange processes, polymer conformation, and gel structure were analyzed.

The problem addressed in the study is that wildlife managers need to know if tolerance for grizzly bears can be predicted based upon education levels (formal education and self-initiated education) and financial compensation to livestock producers living in or near the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. A survey questionnaire was mailed to a sample of 700 livestock producers with a response rate of 55.4%. Relationships were computed using multiple regression, bivariate analysis, t-tests, and chi-square. Results indicate there is statistical significance when correlating formal education and financial compensation with tolerance. However, there was no correlation between self-initiated education and tolerance. Three of the four null hypotheses were rejected, concluding that formal education and financial compensation (for losses of livestock only and losses of livestock plus other costs) are predictors of tolerance for grizzly bears.

Through a postmodern analysis, informed by environmental cultural studies, I critique a relatively new genre, the environmental memoir, to theorize the ways interconnections between nature and culture are either resisted or revealed. Environmental memoir is a genre-hopping exploration of both personal narrative and environmental literature. Critiquing the literary constructions of nature, culture, environmental philosophy, and the autobiographical subject in David Oates' Paradise Wild: Reimagining American Nature and Janisse Ray's Ecology of a Cracker Childhood I question why we think about nature and culture in the ways that we do and what are the implications. This project exposes how problematic any postmodern critique of nature is. We assume that our ideas about nature are straightforward. We claim that nature is anything not-man-made and it often becomes represented through a literalized version of 'nature' as a pure and pristine Eden. Ideas about nature, however, are always informed by culture and we often dismiss the need to theorize and question what factors contribute to our ideas about nature, who benefits from these ideas, and who does not. When we essentialize and naturalize nature we set up dualisms and binaries between nature and culture that reduce the real complexities we face in dealing with environmental philosophy, politics, and literature. These dualisms encourage rigid and extremist thinking that cloud our vision. Theorizing nature breaks down and complicates the binaries that separate nature from culture. Seeking the middle ground in the contested terrain of nature requires us to acknowledging that our narratives about nature, culture, and environmentalism are products of multiple sociohistorical factors. Resisting dualistic thinking offers us a new way to think about the interconnections between our lives, wildness, culture, and nature.	['culture', 'nature']

With the advent of the automobile social energy has consistently drained from our urban cores, forming the sprawling and disarranged suburbs with which we are confronted today. In accordance with this physical isolation caused by personal necessity, there is the dilemma of digital media. Though such technology was developed to facilitate communication with others, our devices have inadvertently caused people to become cognitively irresponsive to their surroundings. Personal necessity has come to diminish social interaction. By assessing the transition and communication between disparate groups of people, and developing a cohesive transportation system that plays off these assessments, people will be compelled to interact with one another while in transit. However, there still remains the issue of the personal device. By developing a scheme that actually responds to the current social media trend, people will be compelled to interact with their environment - and, in turn, with each other. The idea is to deter people from wanting to travel in isolation, while concurrently drawing them together through the actual digital media applications that currently draw our attention so profoundly. The institution of an appropriate public transit system that is linked with social media networks will inherently provide the external stimulus necessary to get people to surrender their devices and interact with one another. The conclusion is to strategically develop a multi-modal transportation hub that is centrally located in a specific urban context that will begin to provide an alternative method of travel other than the personal vehicle. Upon manipulating the existing transit network and developing a public transit center, the entire system is to be linked with digital media kiosks that will provide another means of connectivity between people.

Relay stations can be deployed in a WiMAX network to extend its coverage and improve its capacity. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) enables better channel utilization and exploits the benefits of channel diversity and user diversity. A smart adaptive antenna provides multiple Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) for intended communications and interference suppression, which results in more efficient spatial reuse and higher throughput. In this dissertation, we discuss how to combine those aforementioned technologies in a WiMAX relay network (WRN), and study the routing, scheduling, channel assignment, and antenna DOF assignment problems. It has been shown by previous research that the performance of wireless scheduling algorithms usually depends on the interference degree. Therefore, we study the interference degree in WiMAX networks and show that it is at most 4 in any 2-hop WRN and at most 14 in any general WiMAX network. Next, we consider routing and scheduling in WRN with smart antennas. We formally define the Interference-aware Tree Construction Problem (ITCP) for routing, which offers full consideration for interference impact and DOF availability. We then present an algorithm to optimally solve it in polynomial time. As for scheduling, we first present a polynomial-time, optimal algorithm for a special case in which the number of DOFs in each node is large enough to suppress all potential secondary interference. An effective algorithm is then presented for the general case. We also study a scheduling problem for throughput maximization in OFDMA-based WRN with consideration for multi-user diversity, channel diversity and spacial reuse. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to provide optimum solutions. Furthermore, we show that both the simple greedy algorithm and our proposed weighted-degree based greedy algorithm have approximation ratio of 1/5 for 2-hop WRN and 1/15 for any WiMAX networks. In addition, we present 3 other efficient algorithms, namely, the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) algorithm, the sequential knapsack algorithm and the LP rounding algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of all proposed algorithms.

The urbanization in China has its very own characteristics due to its special political structure and cultural and historical background. Meanwhile, China has faced the transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy. Facing the rapid urban growth and socio-economic change, however, the urban planning in China is actually far behind the development pace and needs reforms in both institutional and philosophical aspects. In addition, urban planning should have innovation to guide the unexpected fast urbanization process and to achieve a sustainable development in the new century. In this paper, the urban development and urban planning in contemporary China will be examined by the case study of Chengdu-one of the largest metropolises in Western China. In this research, historical materials were collected to show the historical background of China and Chengdu's changing urban development and urban planning practices from 1949 to 1976. Statistical data and government documents were collected to assess the economic development and demographic transition in Chengdu. In addition, GIS (Geographic Information System) were using in this study for spatial analysis. Land use and urban planning maps were applied in ArcGIS to reveal the detailed urban land use changes and urban growth patterns in Chengdu in the past two decades. Also, some important urban development projects and programs are discussed and illustrated by photos in this study as the results of the urban planning and various government strategies. The purpose of this research is to show the result of the 'Go west' program that launched by the national government in 1999, also, to reveal the great economic and urban development potential of western Chinese cities in the near future. The case study of Chengdu will provide a better understanding of the driving forces behind urbanization in contemporary China and the factors shaping this process. A better understanding of the economic and urban development in western China could improve the government's decision-making process for lessen the differences between eastern and western China in the future.

Located on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana, Poplar offers an ideal setting to better understand how economic restructuring affects the lives of residents in northern Plains reservation communities. Loss of businesses, consolidation of services, and general economic restructuring continue to challenge communities on the Great Plains. For Great Plains Indian reservations, however, these problems are compounded by additional variables such as persistently high poverty rates, a dynamic relationship with the federal government, and increasing populations. Archival research, landscape analysis, and interview data are all used to better understand the influence of economic restructuring in shaping Poplar. This study demonstrates the value of historical and cultural geographic approaches in understanding the past evolution as well as the contemporary challenges of reservation communities in the American West.

The fragmentation of the television market place with the growth of cable television has pushed science documentaries into a headlong pursuit for higher viewer ratings in a medium dominated by works of fiction. In response to this, science documentary has steadily been pushed to alter the techniques it uses, and adapt its content to become more dramatic. Varying market pressures have led to the rise of two dominant methods of dramatization; narrative imposition and visual spectacle (typically CGI). However, in addition to making science shows more dramatic these two techniques have acted to create a hybridized format, blending subjective speculation with traditional expositional documentary techniques. The result of such hybridization has been to blur the lines between fact and fiction and to allow for the creation of dubious subjunctive documentaries, and almost entirely fictive narrative documentaries. This has acted to uphold the cultural practice of misinterpreting science in order to support fantasy and fiction, and has led to a rise in pseudoscience, which could be potentially very damaging to society. The growth in the public misinterpretation of science could leave our societies woefully unprepared to make informed decisions about the future. To avoid this, I suggest that we find ways to adapt science for television that are more accurate in showing the true nature of science. Instead of bending science to conform to preconceived, linear dramatic narratives, I suggest we look at alternative narratives such as those seen in discursive 'essay' films. And, instead of stretching spectacle and visualization so far as to create fantastical dramatic fictional worlds, I believe we should focus on creating shows that use metaphor and analogy to help us visualize the real, hidden nature of science. By utilizing scientists as guides and peers rather than as heroes and elitists, by choosing discourse over teleology, and by incorporating visually rich metaphors and analogies into science shows, we can render the strange and unfamiliar understandable and engaging.

In addition, this inquiry investigates the development and evolution of the Wylie Camping Company in Yellowstone and the company's connection with the advancement of tourism to the American West. Furthermore, within the context of changing ideas of work and leisure time in the past two centuries, this study explores the advancement of the idea of nature appreciation in America, and the interaction of Yellowstone's tourists with the natural environment. Through a cultural lens this examination aims to illuminate an understanding of tourists' complex emotional, physical, and ideological encounters with the mythic West and the equally fabled Yellowstone. With an eye on nineteenth-century middle-class cultural ideals, this study provides insight into the stagecoach-era tourists' experience of Yellowstone with the Wylie Camping Company. Finally, drawing on archival documents, published literature, and unpublished photo collections, this thesis demonstrates that the Wylie Camping Company played an important role in the establishment of Yellowstone as a legendary tourist destination and in the creation of a model of touring that set a precedent for camping and touring operations in other national parks around the West. To date there is no existing study of the Wylie Camping Co. in Yellowstone National Park.

Where experimental psychologists generally ascribe to scientific realism, searching for the ""clearest"" explication of a subject by employing scientific methods, documentary filmmakers follow any number of personal interpretations of what might best characterize an individual or social story. This philosophical contrast between filmmakers and psychologists parallels the clash between postmodernists and scientific realists. The ""Science Wars"" of the 1990s were a series of miscommunications between these two schools of philosophy, and there remains to be reconciliation, or at least clear dialog, between proponents of the two views. This thesis compares experimental methods in documentary film and in psychology, and proposes the exploration of why the two fields parallel as well as differ from each other in their methods of accommodating uncertainty. I propose that such an exploration of contrasts among experimental methodologies in film and psychology can offer an alternate route to dialog where verbal dialog has previously failed, as between postmodernists and scientific realists."

One potential approach for non-invasively measuring blood flow dynamics in the LV is particle image velocimetry (PIV) using microbubbles. To obtain local flow velocity vectors and velocity maps, PIV software calculates displacements of microbubbles over a given time interval, which is typically determined by the actual frame rate. In addition to the PIV, ultrasound images of the left ventricle can be used to determine the wall position as a function of time, and the inflow and outflow fluid velocity during the cardiac cycle. Despite the abundance of data, ultrasound and PIV alone are insufficient for calculating the flow properties of interest to clinicians. Specifically, the pressure gradient and total energy loss are of primary importance, but their calculation requires a full three-dimensional velocity field. Echo-PIV only provides 2D velocity data along a single plane within the LV. Further, numerous technical hurdles prevent three-dimensional ultrasound from having a sufficiently high frame rate (currently approximately 10 frames per second) for 3D PIV analysis. Beyond microbubble imaging in the left ventricle, there are a number of other settings where 2D velocity data is available using PIV, but a full 3D velocity field is desired. This thesis develops a novel methodology to assimilate two-dimensional PIV data into a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation with moving domains. To illustrate and validate our approach, we tested the approach on three different problems: a flap displaced by a fluid jut; an expanding hemisphere; and an expanding half ellipsoid representing the left ventricle of the heart. To account for the changing shape of the domain in each problem, the CFD mesh was deformed using a pseudo-solid domain mapping technique at each time step. The incorporation of experimental PIV data can help to identify when the imposed boundary conditions are incorrect. This approach can also help to capture effects that are not modeled directly like the impacts of heart valves on the flow of blood into the left ventricle.

There are ways to detect and reduce or eliminate these hazards, however members of the household would have to initiate this action. Self-efficacy, defined as ""an aspect of self-perception that pertains to one's belief in his or her ability to perform a given task or behavior,"" is a driving force in initiating this action (Vennes & Thomas, 1997, p. 1947). In this study, self-efficacy was quantified and evaluated from a sample of 33 low-income and rural family members. The participants scored their self-efficacy on a numerical scale of 1-100, 100 representing very confident. This secondary data was utilized from the ERRNIE study conducted by Dr. Wade Hill and Dr. Patricia Butterfield. Self-efficacy for five environmental hazards was evaluated: radon, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), well water, lead and carbon monoxide. General self-efficacy for household environmental risk reduction was also evaluated. Mean and standard deviation were calculated utilizing SPSS version 18 to create descriptive statistics. The highest mean for reported self-efficacy was for ETS (89.2). It is likely that this hazard had the highest mean due to being able to smell and see this hazard. The lowest mean for reported self-efficacy was for radon (66.2). This hazard is on odorless gas that requires special testing to detect. Interventions to decrease radon can be expensive and may be viewed as overwhelming and therefore decrease self-efficacy. The overall mean for all items evaluated was 76.5, showing that there is a need for greater attention on this topic. This could be completed by nurse practitioners and would focus on increasing awareness of these hazards, the possible health consequences of exposure to the hazards, and what interventions are available to decrease or eliminate this exposure."

In addition, the estimated direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. for 2007 were $431.8 billion. Anticipated barriers to health promotion behavior have been shown to affect intentions to engage in and execute the behaviors. Exploring individual's perception of the benefits of health promotion behaviors is equally important when addressing barriers to making lifestyle changes. CHD is strongly associated with modifiable risk factors including physical inactivity, poor diet, and tobacco use. Although CHD risk factors have been studied extensively, few studies have assessed individuals' combined perceptions of barriers and benefits as reasons for non-adherence to recommended health promotion behaviors related to CHD risk and most of these studies included only women. The purpose of this research study was to examine perceived barriers and benefits to CHD risk modification in men and women living in a rural western state. Two survey tools were used to collect the data from a convenience sample of persons seen in the cardiac care areas at a local hospital in a rural western state. The findings of this study provided important information about the perceived barriers and benefits to CHD risk modification of persons previously diagnosed or at risk for CHD. Results from this study imply that in order to develop effective interventions, it is important to understand the individual and his or her unique characteristics including gender, socioeconomic status, and education level in relation to his or her perceived barriers and benefits to health promotion. Nurse practitioners and other primary care providers can incorporate this knowledge into future strategies to reduce or eliminate barriers, increase perceived benefits, and promote health promotion behaviors in individuals who are at risk for developing CHD. Advocating for health promotion behavior adoption and CHD risk modification offer a very important and practical tool for providers to help individuals address and lower risk factors as well as prevent CHD and treat individuals with established CHD.

One possible way to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere is through the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide. During geologic sequestration, supercritical carbon dioxide is injected into different types of underground formations. Inherent cracks in these formations may lead to the upward leakage of CO 2, and a controllable engineered strategy is needed to reduce this potential leakage. Currently, biomineralization has been used in many different environmental applications but not for the sequestration of carbon dioxide. The goal of this research is to establish biofilm communities of ureolytic bacteria that promote CaCO 3 precipitation in a pulse-flow porous media column system with the intent of reducing the porosity and permeability of the porous media. Pulse-flow column systems were inoculated with different species of ureolytic bacteria: S. pasteurii, B. sphaericus #21776, or B. sphaericus #21787. The bacteria were allowed to grow in the column for five days before a calcium-containing medium was introduced. Flow rate, pH, ammonium concentration, calcium concentration, culturable bacteria, and protein concentration were monitored over the course of the entire experiments. It was shown that all ureolytic species were capable of growing, utilizing urea, and creating an environment that facilitated calcium carbonate precipitation in 1mm diameter glass bead packed columns at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. To better understand the effect of pore space on biomineralization columns packed with 0.1 mm diameter glass beads were constructed and inoculated with S. pasteurii. Within days of calcium introduction, the permeability of the columns was reduced to the point where no more fluid would drain from the column. These results indicate that the ureolytic bacteria are capable of surviving, facilitating calcium carbonate precipitation, and reducing the permeability of the pulse-flow porous media column system. While further study is needed, the precipitation of calcium carbonate through ureolysis may offer a controllable engineered strategy to reduce the permeability of underground formations used for geologic sequestration.

Little data specific to rural primary care provider diabetes teaching resources was available. This project was designed to provide rural primary care providers in Montana with a quick initial diabetes education resource. A Diabetes Education Guide using a pamphlet format was developed and sent to 50 rural primary care providers in Montana. Providers were asked to evaluate the Diabetes Education Guide by completing a six-question evaluation tool and by offering suggestions for improvement to the Diabetes Education Guide. Evaluation tool responses and suggestions for improvement were incorporated into a revised Diabetes Education Guide using a booklet format. Rural primary care provider evaluation responses supported the premise for a Diabetes Education Guide in the rural setting.

Note taking, in some form, will be required of students beyond high school if they pursue higher education. High school students sometimes have difficulty taking notes during a lecture and are not always engaged. In an ideal situation, an instructor would provide an inquiry approach to all new concepts to allow students to build their own model of thinking. Unfortunately, the reality is that time and resources are limited and thus some material must be delivered through lecture to cover all concepts dictated by state standards. Delivering some short lectures are necessary in order to cover all the required material, but students are not always actively learning during lectures whether or not they are taking notes. Would more formal note taking strategies and instruction on note taking skills benefit students? This question led me to my action research topic and research questions. The main research question asks what impact different note taking strategies have on conceptual understanding. Three different note taking strategies were implemented: self-generated, partial (empty-outline), and guided. Formative assessments, summative assessments, surveys, interviews, and a teacher journal were used collectively to gather data. Not only did most students prefer guided notes, but most performed best on formative assessments when guided notes were in place. While guided notes were not a perfect solution, this strategy keeps more students engaged during lecture and their formative quiz scores were positively affected.

The transition occurred because of the addition of a planetarium and computer lab to a new campus science building and the instructor's desire to update his course. This paper discusses the process of transition, including a conceptual framework for the transition, establishing course goals, finding and implementing labs, and examining and analyzing student assessment data to measure the effectiveness of the labs. Instructional and pedagogical changes are also presented. The most significant finding of this study was the increase in student engagement in the astronomy content due to the implementation of a lab component.

Despite this, scholars of both fields rarely address the two media as they act on each other. Cognitive studies give an interesting window on the way the brain processes music and image, but again, they do not address the intersection of the two. A few studies, most notably by Marilyn Boltz, do exist that deal with music/image joint processing, and the effect of one on the other. Boltz's work reveals the great potential of further work, both scientific and scholarly, into the synthesis of music and film. A theory of the interaction of the two is clearly needed.

The effects of teacher collaboration on both students and teachers of Earth science in a high school environment were investigated in this project. Particularly, the project examined the effects of collaboration of Earth science teachers on student understanding, student motivation, and teacher motivation. Earth science teachers collaborated on instructional strategies that included student labs and subsequent formal reports. The materials that were evaluated by a collaborative team were then used to measure how collaboration impacts students and teachers in the classroom. A comparison of a unit that was taught without guidance from collaborative members was made with two units of instruction that implemented materials that were evaluated by a collaborative team. Pre and postunit assessments, concept interviews, and surveys were used to evaluate student understanding. Additional data was collected through teacher interviews and teacher journals to assess student motivation. My own level of motivation and that of my cohorts was evaluated through my journal and observations made by my administrator. Results indicated that student understanding and teacher motivation increased, while the results on student motivation were mixed. The data showed a large gain in student understanding as a result of collaboration on instruction, whereas the level of student motivation was deemed negligible. Teachers in the collaborative group were observed to have increased levels of motivation as a result of the group's collaborative efforts. The project was an enhancement of my own level of motivation as well.

This lack of preparedness may cause these instructors to remain apprehensive about teaching a subject they donÎ±t understand very well. Also, the full-fledged grammar classes which a pre-service English teacher might be required to take in college may further intimidate through an immediate, in-depth explication of the subject with complex diagrams and theories before the teaching candidate is even fully aware of the definition(s) of the word grammar. This text functions as an introductory primer to the subject, giving the numerous surface-level definitions for the word grammar, as well as illustrating several of the important second-level connotations which attach to the word, preparing the English teaching candidate for a full-length exploration of the grammar of the English language and its accompanying theories in a college classroom. Critical theories are applied to the subject of grammar in order to shed light on the denotations and connotations of the word, as well as the reasons why this subject is so important. The resulting aim of this text is that new or pre-service English teachers will gain a full understanding of the multiple meanings of the word grammar, the unspoken connotations which follow this word and subject, the ways in which critical theories can bring a new perspective to an old subject, and the necessity of sharing with students these underlying issues in order to revitalize the study of the subject. The conclusion reveals that rather than closing off discussions and hemming in subjects, definitions may be used to open up a subject to endless possibilities.	['grammar']

Notably, NO was identified as the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in the blood. NO is capable of complex redox chemistry and interaction with a host of protein families. Among these proteins is hemoglobin (Hb) which can interact with NO at the level of the heme and can bind NO at Cys93 on its Ã¢ subunit to form S-nitrosylated Hb (SNO-Hb). NO bound as SNO-Hb is chemically labile and thus preserves bioavailability of NO. However, when NO reacts with oxyHb or deoxyHb NO bioavailability is quenched by conversion to nitrate or by tightly binding the heme, respectively. Therefore, the question is raised as to how NO can be EDRF in the presence of such high Hb concentrations in the blood. One way NO availability can be preserved is by exploiting the redox chemistries of both Hb and NO. Human Hb(NO)4 oxidation by K3Fe(CN)6 was studied and products and intermediates were identified by UV-Vis and EPR spectroscopies. Periodically, samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixture for nitrosylation product and/or EPR analysis. Reaction spectra converted to heme species concentration vs. time plots through leastsquares fitting of five basis spectra. These data were then utilized to generate a de minimis model of the oxidation reaction. We demonstrate that the oxidation of Hb(NO)4 by K3Fe(CN)6 1) leads to the production of SNO-Hb, 2) occurs preferentially at the Ã¢ heme, and 3) proceeds through an HbFeIIINO intermediate.

This project looks at using social constructivism in the high school biology class and its effects on student attitudes, understanding of biological concepts, and long-term retention. This project used three units of study done with the same class. One was done in a traditional biology classroom manner with hands-on labs and teacher lectures. The other two units contained lessons designed to build social relationships with classmates as part of the learning of the unit. Each unit lasted two weeks. Students were assessed before, after, and again two weeks later for each unit. The unit topics were genetics, biotechnology, and evolution. Students took short-answer quizzes, answered essay questions, and filled out survey questionnaires for each unit. Some students did in-depth interviews with the teacher about both the content and the methods of learning. Assessments from each unit were compared with some mixed results. Students did build relationships with their classmates and enjoyed the changes in teaching style. Long-term retention of biological concepts also occurred. The use of the same assessment for the study helped the students show improvement and may not reflect actual improvement. Teacher and student attitude did show improvement.	['teaching']

There may be other tests or combinations of both lab- and field- based tests that are better able to determine sprint performance. PURPOSE: To investigate correlational relationships between a battery of test variables as predictors of skate roller skiing sprint performance in male and female junior and collegiate Nordic skiers. METHODS: Eleven female (MeanÂ±SD; Age (yrs): 19Â±2; Height (cm): 167.6Â±5.5; Body Mass (kg): 64.9Â±7.0; Relative VO âMAX (ml/kg/min): 56.9Â±3.3) and nine male (Age (yrs): 18Â±1; Height (cm): 180.1Â±6.6; Body Mass (kg): 69.9Â±2.2; Relative VO âMAX (ml/kg/min): 70.6Â±4.8) competitive junior and collegiate skiers performed several lab tests including a maximal ski-striding treadmill test to exhaustion (VO âMAX, lactate threshold, TTE). Additional lab tests included upper body power (UBP) tests of 10 and 60 seconds, and lower body power (LBP) tests using a timing pad (1-jump, 4-jump, 60-jump vertical jump tests). Field-based roller skiing tests (40 m flying sprint, and 400 m sprint on a 200 m indoor track) were also completed. Skiers then performed a 1200 m skate roller ski sprint time trial on the indoor track. Pearson-Product Moment correlations assessed the linear relationship between all lab- and field-based variables and average race speed (m/sec) for time trial variables. Correlations were evaluated for both statistical significance (a = 0.01) and practical meaningfulness (r > or = 0.60). RESULTS: Treadmill variables correlated moderate to high with skate roller skiing sprint speed (r = 0.78 - 0.80) as did the indoor skate roller ski testing (r = 0.74 - 0.78). Recovery parameters of blood lactate measured 3 minutes post trials correlated moderately (r = 0.59 - 0.78) as well as both the UBP 10- and 60- second tests and the jump height variables of the vertical jump testing (r = 0.63 - 0.68 and r = 0.59 - 0.71).

Participants completed a battery of three attentional control tasks and also performed a lexical decision task with symmetrical (e.g., brother, sister) or asymmetrical associated items presented in either the forward (e.g., stork, baby) or backward direction (e.g., baby, stork). Results indicated that individuals higher in attentional control showed greater priming for forward associates, but no priming difference in attentional control for backward associates. Further, equal priming occurred for symmetrical associates regardless of attentional control. Results thus illustrated that both high and low attentional control participants used a retrospective semantic matching strategy, while participants high in attentional control used an expectancy generation strategy. Implications are discussed in terms of existing strategies of attentional control and semantic priming.

However, recent conservation efforts have placed a focus on restoring prairie stream systems, and water management decisions require more information regarding the effects of these ponds. This thesis addresses the unknown impacts of stock ponds by modeling Box Elder Watershed located just north of Fort Peck Reservoir in north central Montana. The hydrologic model helped quantify the peak flow rate and runoff volume changes caused by 28 stock ponds on what would have been the undisturbed watershed's flow regime. HEC-HMS was employed to model the watershed. Parameters for the model were abstracted from a GIS and measured in the field. The HEC-GeoHMS extension for ArcGIS 9.3.1 was used to construct necessary model files and create the model components. Measured runoff events from spring 2010 and spring 2011 were used to calibrate non-measurable parameters. To determine the ponds' impacts, frequency storms were run in the model for a watershed with all of the ponds included and a watershed with no ponds included. Results showed that the stock ponds are reducing peak flow rates by 12.66% to 24.08% and reducing runoff volumes by 10.1% to 16.84% depending on the return interval of the frequency storm modeled. In order to apply these results to other watersheds, an attempt was made to find a simplified relationship between pond parameters and an individual pond's influence on the system. This was unsuccessful. The results showed complex model interactions dictating runoff, and some degree of modeling may be required to determine a pond's importance to the hydrology, especially regarding peak flow rate. Finally, the ponds on Box Elder Watershed were ranked in a single list according to their influence on peak discharge and runoff volume. The list will help to prioritize the ponds on Box Elder Watershed for removal since cost and animal water requirements will prevent the removal of all ponds.

Formative assessments were given throughout this period after each section of a chapter was read. Pre and post tests were given before and after each chapter. The next 12 weeks followed the same pattern except for the fact that the students read the textbook silently. Students' surveys were given at the beginning of the school year, after the 12 weeks of reading orally, and again after the 12 weeks of reading silently. Silent reading showed better results in both the formative and summative assessments. The survey showed that students don't particularly enjoy reading orally, but they feel it improves their learning.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery was combined with ancillary predictors of wetland occurrence including habitat type, cover type, landform type, bedrock geology, soil attributes, terrain measures, and climate data. Classification trees were used to predict the likelihood of palustrine wetland occurrence across the Yellowstone landscape. Wetland maps generated by this study are intended to address shortcomings of the National Wetland Inventory in Yellowstone; namely, errors-of-omission and the temporally invariant nature of the inventory. Relative importance of Thematic Mapper imagery, image texture information, terrain measures, and thematic spatial data were assessed by comparing the accuracy of classification trees trained with different subsets of predictors. In general, classification trees using all available predictors exhibited the greatest accuracy. Classification tree structure was similar in models generated with satellite imagery from different years. Also, similar accuracy rates were found across years. The results indicate that the method could be applied to annual wetland monitoring. Average producer's accuracy for the palustrine wetland class was approximately 0.92. Five palustrine wetland classes were discriminated with an average overall accuracy of approximately 0.83. A wetland map derived from a 1 August, 2003 Thematic Mapper image was field-verified in late-summer and early-autumn of 2003. The classification tree methodology appears to be sensitive to within-season wetland condition and yearly wetland variability. Satellite remote sensing located wetlands not mapped by the National Wetland Inventory and also identified upland sites erroneously classified as wetland. Methods developed by this study are general enough to be applied in other physiographic settings and should prove to be useful to amphibian conservation efforts over large geographic extents.

Fisheries scientists and managers must understand the ecology of fishes at multiple spatial scales for effective conservation. Statistical models designed to explain distributions of fishes using environmental characteristics measured at multiple scales have provided this critical information. The objectives of this study were to: i) identify the reach- (i.e., physicochemical and biotic) and watershed-scale characteristics that affect the distribution (i.e., presence or absence) of fishes in prairie streams of Montana; and ii) identify which scale best explains the distribution of fishes in Montana prairie streams: reach, watershed, or a combination of variables measured at either scale (i.e., combined models). Reach and watershed information from 120 sites sampled between 1999 and 2004 was used to model the presence or absence of 20 species using tree classifiers. Models were evaluated by strict criteria in this study as compared to similar studies of prairie fishes. In this study, variables used in models had to reduce a significant amount of the deviance in species distributions before they could be evaluated for their predictive ability; other studies have only examined whether reach- or watershed-scale variables could be used to predict the occurrence of species. Only six reach, four watershed, and seven combined models were found to be significant, suggesting that explaining and predicting the distribution of fishes in eastern Montana is difficult. Significant models did provide information that could be used to guide conservation efforts. Most of the reach- and watershed-scale variables used in these models described large-scale ecological gradients. Additionally, results indicated that significant models could predict individual species distributions with a high level of accuracy. Previous predictive modeling studies have indicated that GIS-derived watershed characteristics better explain fish distributions than reach-scale characteristics. However, this study did not find that watershed-scale variables were significantly better at explaining or predicting fish distributions in eastern Montana. Results from this study suggest further information is needed to understand how spatial scale affects the distribution of fishes in warmwater streams of Montana.

The protective mechanisms are not fully understood. Physiological heterogeneity within biofilms is thought to contribute to the low susceptibility and was therefore studied. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), induction of alkaline phosphatase (APase) by phosphate starvation, and the cell viability assay using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability stain were performed to visualize the spatial patterns of growth and viability within 5-d-old Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The capillary reactor and the drip-flow reactor were employed to obtain biofilms of a range of thickness. Biofilms cultivated in the capillary reactor were usually thinner than those grown in the low-shear drip-flow reactor. The former were examined by in situ confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) whereas the latter were cryoembedded and cryosectioned prior to conventional fluorescence microscopic observation. P. aeruginosa PAO1 with the plasmid pAB1 carrying an inducible, stable gfp was used to identify zones of active protein synthesis. The induction of gfp proved suitable for the visualization of spatial growth patterns within biofilms. Greater GFP activity was evident at the surface of clusters and was not as bright in their centers after induction. Activity appeared more uniform in smaller clusters and less uniform in larger clusters. The APase activity induced by phosphate starvation showed a sharply delineated band of active APase synthesizing cells close to the biofilm-bulk fluid interface and some local APase synthetic activity in the depth of the biofilm. The results of biofilm viability staining using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit turned out to be puzzling and cast doubt on the methodological validity of applying the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability staining method to P. aeruginosa biofilms. The findings of the spatial growth patterns illustrate the physiological heterogeneity that is present in these biofilms. Such variation in the metabolic activity probably contributes to the reduced susceptibility of these biofilms to antimicrobial agents.

A theoretical and two distinct empirical models using monthly data are developed to understand and test the potential of this litigation to affect the national market for lumber. The results of an econometric framework indicate that Northwest public timber fluctuations have affected the Northwest lumber industry, but provide no evidence that the effects are felt in other regions of the United States. A time-series approach indicates that the Northwest lumber market is affected by these timber fluctuations, and that regional lumber markets are interdependent, but again, there is no direct evidence that Northwest public timber fluctuations have affected the lumber markets of other regions. Using each of these empirical frameworks, intervention analysis is performed to test the significance of individual litigation events on regional lumber markets. Econometric-model intervention results provide no evidence to suggest that individual litigation events have influenced these markets, but time-series intervention results suggest that lumber prices may have been influenced by some of the litigation in question.

Experiments within this domain have dubbed the result of optimal complex decision making after delay in which conscious thought is distracted, relative to no conscious distraction the 'Unconscious Thought Effect' (Strick et al., 2011). However, skeptics of unconscious thought processes assert that the 'unconscious thought effect' may be an artifact of conscious or memorial-based processing (e.g. Lassiter et al., 2009; Reyna, 2003). The current experiment hypothesized that measuring individuals' working memory capacity (Unsworth et al., 2005), or attentional control, would clarify whether controlled memorial processes or unconscious thinking produces this effect. Namely, the control and effortful direction of attention influences conscious processes, but unconscious thought processes do not require attention (Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006). Specifically, it was hypothesized that individual WMC would moderate decisions within conditions where conscious thought processes and attention were necessary to car evaluations. This thesis' specific interest is the 'unconscious thought condition.' Results indicating that individual WMC moderates car evaluation following a distraction period would support a memorial-based explanation for unconscious thought effects. Conversely, results indicated no effect of individual WMC on object evaluations following a distraction period would support the existence of independent, sophisticated unconscious thought processes (e.g. Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006). Although this experiment failed to clearly support either hypothesis regarding WMC, several possible explanations of the null and inconsistent results were identified. Attending to experimental issues and theoretical inconsistencies in future research may improve the understanding of the existence and boundarit.es of unconscious thought.

Authors also attempt to unveil and profit from sensitive spiritual and personal secrets, and offer explanations that do not match reality, leading to grave offenses, and the continuation of harmful stereotypes. In this respect, Lolita Last Star intentionally avoids discussions of spiritual and cultural traditions, or the actual personal lives of ""real life"" people, because these areas are guarded for good reasons, and instead focuses on native presence in contemporary American life, in the surprisingly complex, globalized space of the Rocky Mountain West. In other words, the final product is a narrative of Survivance; a concept first explored academically by Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor, in his book Manifest Manners: Postindian Warriors of Survivance. Survivance, I would argue along with many others, may not be as theoretically complex as it first appears. At its most basic level, ""Survivance is a practice, not an ideology, dissimulation, or a theory."" The concept of Survivance only becomes difficult when we look to the spectrum of responses to conditions that inspire the need to do more than survive. Survivance is coping, but it is also subversion, creation, amusement, ingenuity, reimagining, the provision of new explanations, and recapturing one's own destiny. The characters and their actions in Lolita Last Star respond in illustrations of full human vibrancy that transcend space and time, definitions, borders, accusations of authenticity, oppression, domination, petty moralities, victimry, and they move us all one step closer to self-sovereignty and human dignity. They show that if anything westerners contain cultural universes and are better for it. The only frauds are the people too scared to step out of their narrow focus of what a westerner, an Indian, a firefighter, or a cowboy is. They are never afraid to ask, ""Where the hell are we supposed to go from here?"""

Producers and filmmakers alike recognize that this powerful combination bolsters the appearance of objectivity in the piece, and thusly the scientific credibility of the presentation. Critics Carl Gardner and Robert Young argue that this type of stylistic self-containment hurts the advancement of science, and call for a new method of presentation that would encourage discourse and openness instead of closure. This essay highlights the atypical science films of Charles and Ray Eames, Errol Morris, and Jean PainlevÃ© to show how the incorporation non-redundant visuals can facilitate a personal, critical reading amongst their viewing audience.

Furthermore, this analysis contrasted local trends for types of disabilities with national trends. Additionally, there was an analysis of how local and national trends may have been impacted by five recent watershed events. The five events include the No Child Left Behind Act; the Higher Education Opportunity Act; the Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act; the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) and Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The results of this study revealed that non-traditional age students are the majority of students with disabilities at MSU- Billings. Additionally, they are enrolled in proportionally larger numbers than their nondisabled peer age group, which is consistent with national data. Based on results there was also a total increase in numbers in almost all of the types of disability categories including a clear trend in the increase in students diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. These increases are consistent with national trends. Additionally, a comparison of watershed events with local and national enrollment trends of certain types of disabilities reveal that legislation in 2008 broadened the definition of intellectual and cognitive disabilities for students in higher education. Also, funding for veterans was increased with the New GI Bill. This has resulted in increases in enrollments of diverse groups of students including those with intellectual and/or cognitive impairments, TBI, and psychological impairments. Locally, the shift of students with disabilities at MSU Billings from orthopedic and mobility impairments to mental, emotional or psychological conditions has also been demonstrated by a large increase in number of students with ADHD, TBI, Asperger's Disorder and psychological impairment since 2008. The results support an annual review of these groups by policymakers in high education to provide accommodation and mental health support services to those with specific types of disabilities such as veterans with TBI or students with psychological disabilities.

They provide a flexible workforce with specialized expertise, often prefer to work part-time and frequently teach large introductory courses. Concerns about their treatment and the environment in which they work are often investigated because their attitudes about their jobs and the workplace can have an impact on their students and institution as a whole. This study seeks to further investigate the psychological health of this diverse group of faculty and more specifically studies the job satisfaction (JS) and organizational sense of belonging (OSB) of NTT instructional faculty at a public research intensive university. The study used survey methods to determine the distribution of different NTT faculty types at the institution, obtain demographic information about their employment and determine their level of JS and OSB. An electronic survey was sent to 397 identified NTT faculty and 194 responded to a 77 item survey. The respondents self-selected themselves into one of four previously determined NTT faculty categories. A variety of methods were used to analyze the data including descriptive statistics, ANOVAs and multiple linear regression analyses. Results indicate that this institution has three different types of NTT faculty and that their JS and OSB vary. One of the groups has significantly more job satisfaction but lower sense of belonging scores than the other two groups. The other two groups have significantly less job satisfaction but have a greater sense of belonging to their department and university. These results support previous findings that NTT faculty members are a complex group of faculty who have different motivations and expectations for teaching. This diverse group of faculty should not be treated uniformly and distinct group variations should be considered when initiating recommendations for improving their professionalism.

The exhibition prompts viewers to question contemporary agri-business and reflect on the methodology of genetically modifying seed. In my artwork, I aim to express what agriculture used to be, speak about where it is today, and question where it is going because of this technology. Traditionally in the past, seed was passed down from generation to generation. Specific vegetables and fruit were grown at specific times and locations, depending on the season and environment, creating the term 'in-season.' Today, through the development and advancement of technology, and because of the exponential population growth, the American farmer is now producing enough to feed himself and many others. In the twenty-first century we can transfer genes between unrelated organisms; offering no limitations and no restraints. Farmers quickly became scientists, and, today, scientists have now become farmers.

Unfortunately, knowledge of these viruses is limited. Attempts to study the structure of the replication/transcription complex of these viruses using physical methods like X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have been largely unsuccessful due to the large size of this complex, as well as the amount of disorder these proteins show when isolated. The goal of this Bioinformatic study is to investigate sequence conservation in relation to evolutionary function/structure of the nucleoprotein (N), large subunit polymerase protein (L) and phosphoprotein (P) of the Order Mononegavirales. In the combined analysis of 63 representative viruses from the four viral families (Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Filoviridae, and Bornaviridae) were predicted using a developed Disorder, Intra-residue contact and Compensatory mutation Correlator, (DisICC) pipeline. The N protein results indicate conservation for disorder in the C-terminus region of the N viral proteins important for interacting with P and L during transcription and replication. Portions of the N-terminus are responsible for N:N stability with interactions identified by the presence or lack of co-evolving intra-protein contact predictions. Correlations between location and conservation of predicted regions reveal strong divisions between families while highlighting conservation within individual families in L. Suggesting L Domains are conserved across the Order with strong intra-sequence pressures for conservation, while hinge regions lack these pressures. Conserved disorder is reported for: the amino-terminal of L for L-L complex formation across all families, Domain V for capping activity across Paramyxovirinae and Vesiculovirus, and Domain VI for cap methylation is conserved across Paramyxovirinae, Rubulaviruses, Avulaviruses, Ferlavirus and Morbilliviruses. The P sequences show a strong conservation of disorder within viral families that corresponds to their binding Domains with little intra-sequence pressure. Validation of these predictions by current experimental and structural information illustrates the benefits of the DisICC pipeline for characterizing protein disorder and intra-residue contact that can reveal likely residues as disruption targets in these viruses that are infectious to humans.

Thus, children growing up in situations with fewer economic resources have a higher risk of adult obesity. The Cumulative Stress Model suggest that the confluence various stressors associated with childhood poverty, results in chronic stress, which, in turn, leads to adult obesity as a result of consumption of high fat and high sugar foods that serves as a coping mechanism. The current study investigated the whether chronic stress during childhood was a better predictor of adult obesity than other proposed models. These included the Food Choice Constraints Model, the Neighborhood Affluence Model, and the Feast and Famine Cycle Model, as well as a model based on health disparities at birth. This study used of a novel retrospective survey to examine the influence of various childhood circumstances on adult body mass index (BMI) among a group of college students including as subgroup oversampled for childhood poverty. Results failed to confirm the predicted relationship between childhood poverty and increased adult BMI or other measures typically associated with BMI, including dietary fat intake, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity. The best childhood predictors of adult BMI were low birth weight and father's overweight. SNAP participation was positively associated with increased fruit and vegetable intake, which provides tentative support for the Feast and Famine Cycle Model. This model predicts overeating of all types of foods as food becomes more plentiful. Future research is needed to elucidate those specific aspects of childhood poverty that predict adult obesity. Such data may suggest the most effective approaches to avoiding the life-long negative health consequences of child poverty, including obesity.

For example, some fuel tanks in U.S. Navy vessels utilize seawater to replace ballast lost to burned fuel. This introduces a consortium of aerobic and anaerobic fuel-degrading organisms that form biofilms on the tank's inner walls. These biofilms create oxic gradients; allowing aerobic and anaerobic organisms to live in synergistic alliance. The presence and activity of these organisms influence degradation of fuels and corrosion of tank materials. This thesis focuses on corrosion of iron under strict anaerobic (anoxic) sulfidogenic marine environments. Manganese sulfide (MnS) inclusions are known sites of pitting corrosion in carbon steel in aqueous environments. This work investigates pitting corrosion of carbon steel under exposure to sulfate-reducing organisms in anaerobic marine environments. It was found that pitting was initiated in the boundary regions of MnS inclusions at normal pH. Corrosion in general was more pronounced in the presence of a biofilm of sulfatereducing bacteria than in abiotic sulfide medium. It is proposed that the initiation of an anodic reaction leading to the dissolution of the Fe matrix and subsequent pitting of steel in the boundary regions of MnS inclusions is due to strain exerted on the Fe matrix by MnS minerals mixed within the Fe matrix at the interface due to metallurgical processes. We discovered that on the average only 1 out of ~2200 inclusions (or ~2 pits per mm Â² area) are activated to initiate pitting corrosion at normal pH. This increases very rapidly and reaches to pitting densities of ~4200 pits/mm Â² at acidic conditions (pH <4). The main reason for this is because MnS inclusions start dissolving at low pH conditions via MnS+ 2H + --> H 2S + Mn Â²+. This mechanism produces H 2S abiotically, which auto catalyzes the pits to grow along the long (hundreds of microns) micro-wires of MnS inclusions. At certain locations these micro-pits join together to give rise to macroscopic pitting in metals.

The aim of this integrative literature review was to provide information and direction to health care professionals, including nurses, who deliver care to the AI/AN youth across Indian Country. An integrative review, including a comprehensive computer-assisted search of three separate databases, and a subsequent review of the reference lists of selected articles was completed. Forty-one articles met the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. The findings, recommendations and practice implications were documented in a chart (Appendix C) and then organized according to the biological systems theory model (Appendix D), which allowed for illustration of the multi-layered risk unique to Native youth, the importance of considering the social context in which Native youth suicide occurs, and assisted in identifying practice implications specific to Native American youth. The risk factors ranged from individual and family ""day-to-day realities,"" to factors that were a part of the adolescent's environment but not necessarily a direct influence, to cultural, economic and political issues, and historical events that remain active as factors affecting the lives of Native youth. The results of this integrative literature review provided the evidence for the need to develop a collaborative approach that is culturally anchored in the world of the Native youth. The need for increased research related to addressing the Native American youth suicide crisis is described as imperative with suggestions to focus on studying current culturally appropriate, holistic care in attempts to determine its effectiveness."

Rain, snow and ice can reduce pavement friction and increase the potential for crashes especially when vehicles are traveling too fast for conditions. Under these circumstances, the posted speed limit at a location may no longer be safe and appropriate. Inclement weather can also have considerable impacts on the operations of highways, lowering the capacity of highway system and decreasing the efficiency of the system for drivers. Consequently, new approaches are necessary to influence motorists' behavior in regards to speed selection when inclement weather presents the potential for reduced pavement friction at a given location. Among these approaches is the use of weather responsive variable speed limit (VSL) systems. This thesis reviews the current state of practice of weather responsive VSL systems and other similar systems. It also characterizes the problems faced at a potential weather responsive VSL system location through the analysis of crash, speed and weather data. This effort also includes the concept development of a system for the proposed location. A critical component of these systems (the non-invasive weather sensor) is also evaluated to determine its capabilities for use in these and similar systems. Current practice showed the use of weather responsive VSL systems for rain, snow, ice, fog, and wind. In general, these systems were found to have positive effects in reducing crashes and speeds. The proposed study site experienced crashes at a rate higher than expected for similar locations. Also over 60% of crashes at the location occur during wet pavement conditions, but the pavement at the site is only wet approximately 6% of the time. Speed data analysis shows that drivers at this location don't reduce their speeds much during wet conditions. A system concept for the proposed location is presented. The sensor evaluation determined that the sensor is capable of producing valuable information for VSL and similar systems. A calibration is also evaluated and proven to greatly improve the accuracy of the water depth measurements produced by the sensor.

Therefore, I intend to defend this thesis through an examination of movement's origin and development within American culture over the past three decades, encapsulated by a primary case study on craft beer in the state of Montana, with specific emphasis on the narrative of the Bozeman Brewing Company in Bozeman, Montana. In addition, I present the film Crafty as a visual companion to this written argument, with the ultimate intention of effectively communicating the thesis on multiple levels of textual representation. While the film itself seeks to dissect cultural inferences from the Montana case study in order to extrapolate norms applicable to the larger scale of the American craft beer movement, Crafty is meant to be the first installment of an ongoing series of programs that give credence to the individuality of each brewing company (both micros and macros). Therefore, Crafty should be viewed as a pilot episode of sorts; it exists as both a stand alone visual statement of the thesis and an introduction to something that is to be continued, something worthy of the continuing evolution of the craft beer and craft brewing companies in America. In addition, the intended episodic notion of Crafty will serve to punctuate the micro-narratives within the modern American craft beer movement because each brewery is the product of its own ongoing history that deserves recognition as a component of American culture.

Significant levels of phthalates, parabens and lead have been detected in many cosmetics. Almost all humans tested have some level of phthalate, paraben and lead body burden. These three chemicals represent a few of the many chemicals prevalent in cosmetics. Human and animal studies link these chemicals with several negative health consequences including endocrine disrupting effects. A review of epidemiology reveals an increasing trend in the prevalence of associated health consequences. In the United States, the cosmetic industry is independently responsible for the safety of cosmetic products. The Federal government has regulatory oversight through the FDA, but does not have authority to test product safety. The Toxic Substance Control Act from 1976 and the Food, Drug and the Cosmetics Act of 1938 represent the most current legislation addressing regulatory standards for personal care products. Nurses advocate for legislation that protects public safety and intervene where public exposures to environmental health hazards are identified.

Correctly performing an antisaccade requires the ability to inhibit an automatic response (look away from a flashing cue) as well as maintain the task goal to look opposite the cue. Past research has shown that this ability relates to Working Memory Capacity (WMC). Goal maintenance is assumed to occur before trial onset, during presentation of the fixation stimulus. Yet, there has been little research investigating whether there is an optimal time for preparing to execute the goal of inhibiting the automatic response. Furthermore, little has been done to discover how mind wandering might interfere with goal maintenance and saccade performance across the delay period. Three experiments tested the prediction that increasing the fixation duration during saccade tasks will differentially impact performance between individuals higher and lower in WMC. In Experiment 1, correlations between antisaccade accuracy and WMC increased across fixation duration, with high-span participants' performance increasing across the delay, but no effect of delay for low-spans participants. In Experiment 2, prosaccade accuracy plateaued for high-span individuals from medium to long delays, but decreased for low-spans individuals. In Experiment 3, reports of mind wandering were correlated with WMC and antisaccade accuracy, yet impacted high-span participants more than low-span participants. The results are interpreted in terms of the required preparatory and maintenance processes mentioned above.

No research existed that represented the exclusive experience of women who take SGA. A qualitative study of the experience of adult women between the ages of 19-44 with the diagnosis of schizophrenia was conducted. Participants were recruited through the distribution of flyers by physicians at two mental health centers in the Northwest. One participant contacted the interviewer by phone and an interview was completed in a private setting. The interview was transcribed and analyzed using Luborsky's method for thematic analysis (1994). Topics and patterns were identified and then subsequently compared with the Health Promotion Model (Pender, Murdaugh & Parsons, 2011). Topics included: a) getting to know the illness, b) experiencing the effects of medications, c) appreciating the therapeutic effects of medications, d) feeling irritated with the illness, and e) learning how to manage the illness. Difficulties with recruitment indicate a need for further study to determine the best way to access this unique population.

If there is a lack of consensus about what integration means, what then are these teachers doing when they say that they integrate? Surprisingly, few researchers have taken the time to explore the descriptions and practices of elementary educators. This study investigated five cases in an effort to establish how teachers view the domain of subject area integration. Qualitative data was collected through interviews with the participants and observations of the integrated lessons they taught. The data revealed a healthy mix of commonalities within and differences between the teachers' descriptions and practices. These similarities and differences revealed a model of integration that goes beyond the linear continuums common in the literature. The conclusions of this study propose a model of the domain that consists of four variables. These variables can be used to describe with great detail an individual practice of integration and allow educators and administrators an opportunity to consider and plan for growth in the practice of subject area integration.

For sustainable production, harvesting, and soil protection, technology is needed that can quickly, accurately and non-destructively measure biomass. Remote sensing of vegetation spectral responses, which tend to be highly responsive to changes in biomass, may provide a means for inexpensive, frequent, and non-destructive measurements of biomass at management relevant scales. A valuable resource for land managers would be a biomass measurement model that could non-destructively measure biomass at different phenological growth stages across multiple growing seasons. The objective of this study was to compare remote sensing-based biomass measurement models using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and bandwise regression remote sensing techniques to determine which model best measures biomass at different phenological growth stages over multiple growing seasons on CRP pastureland in central Montana. Biomass and plant spectral response measurements were collected over the 2011 (n = 108) and 2012 (n = 108) growing seasons on an 8.1 ha CRP pasture. Measurements were stratified by phenological growth stage and growing season. Half of the data was used to build each measurement model and the other half was used to test the power of each model to measure biomass. Remote sensing-based biomass measurement models were constructed using NDVI measurements from an active ground-based sensor, NDVI measurements from Landsat images, and band combination measurements from Landsat images. All biomass measurement models showed no difference between actual and estimated biomass values (p-value > 0.05). The biomass measurement model using NDVI measurements from Landsat images had the smallest margin of difference between estimated biomass and actual biomass (22 kg/ha + or - 96 kg/ha), followed by the combination of individual spectral bands from Landsat images (128 kg/ha + or - 71 kg/ha), and NDVI measurements from a ground based sensor (182 kg/ha + or - 94 kg/ha). Results indicate remote sensing-based biomass measurement models are accurate at measuring biomass at different phenological growth stages across multiple growing seasons. Land managers can implement remote sensing-based biomass measurement models into their land management strategies to quickly, accurately, and non-destructively measure biomass across a landscape.

In typical experiments supporting this idea, participants receive complex information about target objects and then report judgments on those targets immediately, after 3min in which to think, or after a 3min distraction task that arguably disrupts conscious thinking but not unconscious thinking. Typical results demonstrate that individuals form better judgments in the latter condition relative to participants in other conditions, a finding dubbed the Deliberation-Without-Attention effect. This effect is predicted and well explained by Unconscious Thought Theory. However, an alternative explanation derived from the Fuzzy-Trace Theory of memory may account for observed patterns of results without assuming an active, sophisticated unconscious thought process. To date, no published research directly tests these two potential alternatives. The current experiment intends to conclusively test between Unconscious Thought Theory and Fuzzy-Trace Theory as alternative explanations for the effect by shifting the goal for successful judgments after the information is presented. According to Unconscious Thought Theory, an active unconscious thought process should be able to reevaluate information according to an updated goal. A passive memory process, on the other hand, is by definition unable to engage in this type of active reevaluation. Data show both memory and unconscious thought processes are at work. As predicted by Fuzzy-Trace Theory, decisions tend to generally reflect overall evaluations rather than updated goals. However, participants who are comfortable with ambiguity do reevaluate information during a distraction period when they have the goal to do so. This finding cannot be rectified with Fuzzy-Trace Theory, strongly suggesting that Fuzzy-Trace Theory is not a viable comprehensive explanation for the Deliberation- Without-Attention effect.

Aspen clones regenerate if sprouts are produced that grow into recruitment stems (>2 m tall) and replace the mature overstory. Beaver were reintroduced to the Eagle Creek drainage on the NYWR in 1991 in an attempt to facilitate recovery of riparian aspen communities by removing aspen overstory and increasing sprouting. However, intense ungulate browsing, primarily from the Northern Yellowstone elk herd, was preventing aspen recruitment in Eagle Creek in 2005. Wolf predation has contributed to a 56% decrease in this elk herd from 2005 to 2012. I investigated the effects of beaver reintroduction and ungulate herbivory on aspen recovery in the Eagle Creek drainage in 2012. Aerial photos taken of Eagle Creek in 1990, 2005, and 2011 showed that although beaver activity stimulated aspen sprouting, the mature overstory of many aspen stands has not been replaced 21 years after beaver reintroduction (p>0.05). Sprouting and recruitment were investigated using 4-m radius circular vegetation plots (n=31) established in aspen stands throughout Eagle Creek in 1997 and monitored annually until 2012. Beaver activity stimulated increased sprouting in 71% of these plots, and 77% of the plots had > or = 1 recruitment stem in 2012. Prolonged flooding and high browsing levels contributed to lack of recruitment in 23% of the plots (p<0.05). In 2012, 75% of the paired plots associated with aspen exclosures had unfenced aspen stems with an average stem height > or = 2 m. Recent increases in aspen recruitment in Eagle Creek indicate that aspen communities are regenerating. This is likely the result of decreased browsing pressure on aspen saplings from 2005 to 2012. These findings are consistent with the predictions of a density-mediated trophic cascade following wolf reintroduction.

As a cost-effective way to do both, I propose developing a video for a museum website that can be easily adapted for use in an exhibit. The priorities and ideologies of science museums differ radically from those of science and nature television networks. This paper explores the needs of museums, identifying key contrasts with television, and shows how those needs are reflected in the content, form, and style of the two-part science video Living in Pele's Paradise. Through the story of the spectacular 1959-60 eruption of KÄ«lauea Volcano, the video shows how research and monitoring contribute to helping communities prepare for volcanic hazards. I highlight the characteristics that make the video appropriate for a science museum through comparisons with recent volcano documentaries for television. I also discuss the changes needed to adapt the web video for a museum exhibit.

This morphology is often the weak layer responsible for full depth avalanches. Previous research primarily focused on quantifying the conditions necessary to produce depth hoar. Limited work has been performed to determine the underlying reason for the microstructural changes. Using entropy production rates derived from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, this research shows that depth hoar forms as a result of the snow progressing naturally toward thermal equilibrium. Laboratory experiments were undertaken to examine the evolution of snow microstructure at the macro scale under nonequilibrium thermal conditions. Snow samples with similar initial microstructure were subjected to either a fixed temperature gradient or fixed heat input. The metamorphism for both sets of boundary conditions produced similar depth hoar chains with comparable increases in effective thermal conductivity. Examination of the Gibbs free energy and entropy production rates showed that all metamorphic changes were driven by the system evolving to facilitate equilibrium in the snow or the surroundings. This behavior was dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. An existing numerical model was modified to examine depth hoar formation at the grain scale. Entropy production rate relations were developed for an open system of ice and water vapor. This analysis showed that heat conduction in the bonds had the highest specific entropy production rate, indicating they were the most inefficient part of the snow system. As the metamorphism advanced, the increase in bond size enhanced the conduction pathways through the snow, making the system more efficient at transferring heat. This spontaneous microstructural evolution moved the system and the surroundings toward equilibrium by reducing the local temperature gradients over the bonds and increasing the entropy production rate density. The employment of nonequilibrium thermodynamics determined that the need to reach equilibrium was the underlying force that drives the evolution of snow microstructure. This research also expanded the relevance of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by applying it to a complicated, but well bounded, natural problem.

Scop.) are changing and degrading North American rangeland ecosystems by replacing native grasses and forbs. Conventional control methods are often not cost-effective. Using livestock to manage invasive species offers a potentially cost effective alternative. The objectives of our first study were to determine if: 1) cattle trained to consume spotted knapweed and Canada thistle in 2004 retained their training in 2011, 2) calves and yearlings of the 2004 trained cattle consume more spotted knapweed and Canada thistle than calves and yearlings from untrained cows, and 3) yearlings trained to graze Canada thistle in mid-July consume more of the weed than untrained yearlings in late July and late August. In our 2011 study, trained cattle did not spend more time grazing spotted knapweed or Canada thistle than untrained cattle. In 2011, calves and yearlings from trained cattle did not spend more time grazing spotted knapweed or Canada thistle than those from untrained cattle. Yearlings trained to graze Canada thistle consumed similar amounts as untrained yearlings when grazed in July and less than untrained yearlings in August. The objectives of our second study were to determine if: 1) individual cattle spent similar amounts of time grazing spotted knapweed in 2011 and 2012, and 2) individual yearlings affect time spent grazing spotted knapweed of their peers. Individual animals tended to spend similar amounts of time grazing spotted knapweed in July of 2011 and 2012. Grazing yearlings, that tended to spend high or low amounts of time grazing spotted knapweed, together did not affect their time spent grazing this weed. Cattle innately grazed spotted knapweed (20-50% of their time grazing) and, to a much lesser extent, Canada thistle (0-17% of their time grazing); training did not result in greater amounts of time spent grazing these weeds. Individual cattle with the innate behavior to graze spotted knapweed can be identified and retained in herds to potentially increase grazing of spotted knapweed. With proper grazing management, cattle grazing can be used as one tool in an integrative approach to control spotted knapweed on rangelands.

In 1872, the United States created the first National Park, Yellowstone by and act of Congress. By 1876, the community of Cooke City, located near the Northeast corner of Yellowstone National Park, had developed into a mining community, but faced the major problem of providing cheap access to transportation. A railroad would provide cheap and easy transportation from Cooke City to the eastern markets. However, both Yellowstone National Park, and the mountainous terrain surrounded Cooke City and would plague the development of a railroad route. Between 1884 and 1894, the supporters of the Cooke City mines developed proposals to build a railroad to serve the mining community and petitioned Congress to grant a charter. The Northern Pacific railroad was among the corporations interested in developing a railroad to Cooke City. To access the mining community, four different railroad routes were proposed to be built. Out of the four different railroad routes, the route through Yellowstone National Park generated the most controversy. By examining primary source documents from the time frame including; newspapers, magazines, Congressional records and reports along with the corporate records of the railroad companies an in depth study of the railroad proposals was created and why the railroad was never constructed. By the middle of the 1890's the value of the mining claims was discovered to be less productive than first thought, and the railroad proposals slowly disappeared. To this date, no study has been done regarding the history of the Cooke City railroad developments. The railroad proposals not only developed the history of Cooke City, but also challenged the identity of the new national park and what conservation meant to Yellowstone National Park.	['history']

Postpartum depression has been identified as the ""most common complication of childbearing"" (Teng, Blackmore, & Stewart, 2007, pg. 93). It is estimated that between 10% and 20% of all childbearing women will be affected by postpartum depression (PPD) (McCarthy & McMahon, 2008). This disorder not only affects the well-being of the mother, but of the infant as well. As many as 50% of all cases may go unrecognized and untreated. Barriers to care that have been identified include stigma, lack of child care, finances, poor past experiences with healthcare providers, language barriers, failure to recognize own symptoms as PPD, and providers' lack of understanding of the condition (McCarthy & McMahon, 2008). Increasing awareness of these common barriers among primary care providers may enable them to assist patients in a way that will improve health outcomes for both the mother and the infant."

The nature of magical realism as a literary mode as it fits into postcolonial thought and engages with reader response theory allows for an analysis of the ""apocalyptic"" endings of these novels that shows that they engage in ontological disruption and conscientization on the part of the reader with reference to their role as reader, or consumer, of texts."

Microbial consortia are capable of cooperating in a coordinated fashion to extract mass and free energy from their environment. Chemical and biological engineers have long been keen to harness microbial processes for the development of technologies with applications ranging from energy capture to environmental remediation to human health. The pursuit of novel microbial biotechnologies has given rise to the relatively new discipline of microbial consortia engineering, which differs from and expands upon more traditional monoculture based practices. Many successful examples of applied and/or engineered microbial consortia mimic fundamental ecological strategies observed from nature, highlighting the importance for engineers to study natural biological phenomena. The overarching goal for this dissertation was to observe and quantitatively characterize interactions and physical phenomena occurring within select microbial consortial systems. The technical research presented here explores microbial consortia on three main fronts: (i) metabolically engineered heterotrophic systems, (ii) photoautotrophic-heterotrophic biofilm systems and (iii) naturally occurring thermo-acidophilic microbial mat systems. The metabolically engineered systems were designed to mimic a common ecological strategy involving syntrophic metabolite exchange via primary-productivity coupled with secondary consumption of potentially inhibitory byproducts (i.e., acetic acid). This system exhibited enhanced biomass productivity as compared to monoculture controls. The primary-productivity concept was also explored, in a more traditional sense, by characterizing production, consumption and exchanges of oxygen within photoautotrophic-heterotrophic biofilm systems. Tight spatial coupling of oxygenic-photosynthesis and aerobic-respiration was observed in both biofuel producing and waste-water remediating biofilm communities. The role of oxygen as an important terminal electron acceptor was also investigated in pristine Fe(III)-oxide microbial mats from geothermal springs located in Yellowstone National Park (USA). For these systems, oxygen availability defines ecological niche environments that spatially govern specific community member abundances and activities. Classical chemical engineering reaction and diffusion analysis was used to model concentration dependent oxygen consumption kinetics and establish that these mats are likely mass transfer limited. Both primary-productivity and microbially mediated oxygen reactions are interrelated, cross-cutting themes throughout this dissertation. The research described here is interdisciplinary chemical engineering that utilizes fundamental microbial ecology as a foundational platform.

Much has been learned about sustainable water use and human effect on water quality, but not all efforts to disseminate this knowledge to the general public were successful. This author reviewed and categorized select water education initiatives implemented in the last 40 years and examined their long-term efficacy. Within the first generation, the author looked at the Chesapeake Bay cleanup and the Lake Erie cleanup along with associated education efforts. Chesapeake Bay was relatively successful as an educational effort, while Lake Erie has not had the same kind of long-term public involvement or success mitigating nutrient loading to the lake. The second generation was identified by emphasis on nonpoint source pollution and respective education efforts. Voluntary nonpoint source education was not received nor effective at the rates originally anticipated, largely because of the economic uncertainty associated with implementing best management practices. The third, and current, generation has focused on technological advances and their impacts on water rights, use and mitigation. Agricultural and environmental educators must strive to provide fast, fact-based information and to increase individual self-efficacy by modifying cultural and perceptual norms regarding historic water use. Additional research is needed on impacts from and to specific demographic water users as well as the most effective content and contexts for water resource and educational programming.

Three factors are predicted to be important determinants of national park visitation rates. These factors are entrance fees, travel costs (represented by driving costs), and income. Both travel costs and income have been shown to be significant determinants of national park visitation rates in the economic literature; however, the effect of entrance fees on visitation rates is inconclusive. Determining how the factors of interest influence visitation rates is accomplished by first developing a theoretical demand and supply model of park visits. The theoretical model informs the empirical model with predictions for how changes in entrance fees affect the quantity of visits when fees are above, below, or at the market-clearing level of the fee. These predictions are tested empirically by estimating a linear model of both annual and monthly park-level visitation to a sample of 165 national parks. The main results of the analysis show that income is not a significant determinant of national park visitation rates, but that both travel costs and entrance fees have a negative effect on visitation. Further, more detailed estimation procedures that analyze visitation to parks pooled based on designation and level of use show that the effect of entrance fees on national park visitation rates is both park-specific and season-specific.

The project was designed to determine if credit-deficient students in a self-paced, online biology course would learn more and become more engaged learners if active learning opportunities were added to the normal online program. Students in these courses normally receive only passive instruction and occasional tutoring when requested. The students involved in the study were enrolled in the Virtual High School program in Clarksville-Montgomery County, Tennessee for the 2012-13 school year for the purpose of catching up to the required 22 credits necessary for on-time graduation. Each of these students was considered credit deficient to the point of not completing the graduation requirements before being dropped at the end of their fourth year of high school, as per district policy. Student learning using the traditional online program was compared to student learning using the online program combined with both interactive online activities and hands-on, small-group activities. Results indicated that student understanding was increased, but there was little effect on long-term memory. Data also indicated a negative impact on both teacher and student attitude and motivation due to the increased structure and time requirement for the additional activities.

This capstone project looks at the effect of inquiry-based instruction (hands-on learning) on students' abilities to communicate and collaborate while measuring student engagement. Students of all reading levels were actively engaged in designing and carrying out investigations. Student communication was measured through a variety of mediums. Student collaboration took place in partner, small group and whole group activities. By allowing first grade students to ""do"" science rather than read about science, they were able to capitalize on their natural curiosity and thereby learn vital science skills while developing a working knowledge base. Inquiry-based instruction provided a positive learning environment for students of all reading levels. Struggling readers benefited from inquiry-based instruction because the students did not have to rely on reading skill and were able to be successful in the science classroom. Conversely, by not being able to read the answer, on grade level readers experienced a learning disequilibrium and had to rely on less used skills during inquiry-based instruction. It was refreshing to see a different set of student successes."

In order to engage students and hopefully improve test scores, Qwizdom student response clickers were used during the first semester of the 2012-2013 school year in a high school biology classroom. The results from the chapter tests as well as the mid-term exam were compared to the results from the previous year's class, when clickers were not used. The clickers were shown to have a significant positive impact on assessment scores as well as student participation. Students and teachers felt that the clickers not only improved participation in class but also made the students focus more on the material.

A new teaching strategy called Science Talks was designed to focus on these skills and it was administered for twenty minutes each day for one week. A total of three weeks of Science Talks were administered, and they were alternated with three weeks of science instruction that did not include a Science Talk. These talks began with a science question being posed that included two variables and the students worked with a peer to develop a testable investigation or question. Overall, the Science Talk teaching strategy showed improvement in both the students' observation and questioning skills during the mid-data analysis and a more dramatic improvement during the post-data analysis. The peer-peer communication and class discussions during the three-week treatment phases were also found to be beneficial to the students' learning and aided the teacher's instructional strategies.

San Diego Zoo Education staff provided materials for activities to be conducted in the classroom by teachers both before and after a field trip to the zoo for the Life Cycles program for second grade students. Data collection instruments included student artifacts and attitudinal questionnaires supported by teacher surveys and researcher observations of student participation. Students in classes using the pre- and post-visit activities were compared with students in classes who participated in a Life Cycles program but who did not receive the pre- and post-visit activities. Results showed students had a considerable amount of prior knowledge about animal life cycles and that they were overwhelmingly positive about their visit to the zoo. Students who completed a pre-visit activity in the classroom showed a higher percentage of participation in the educational presentation at the zoo. Teachers bringing students to the zoo did not value post-visit activities but highly valued the opportunity for their students to see live animals.

The study was conducted with two sections of physics. Students in both sections of physics initially responded to conceptual questions independently and then responded following peer discussion. One section was provided option-based grouping for peer discussions while the students in the other section were grouped based on their initial responses, called evidence-based grouping. Using CRS formative assessment data to facilitate the instantaneous grouping of students with different responses facilitated the evidence-based grouping. Results revealed that evidence-based groupings enhanced the effectiveness of peer discussion, as noted by improved conceptual understanding and increased student motivation for seeking answers. However, the positive, moderate correlation between pre-assessment scores and post-assessment scores for both treatment groups showed the benefit of using technology to support peer discussion in enhancing learning.

Traditional science teaching often seems removed from the work that ""real"" scientists do. By participating in project based learning, students had the opportunity to do the work of a scientist and then apply their learning to a real world problem. During a unit of study on evolution where the focus question was ""Do humans affect the evolution of organisms?"" students were presented with a scenario asking them to determine the impact humans are having on the natural environment. To accomplish this task, students learned how to do field studies focusing on biodiversity. Using birds as a focus, they took data on campus and at a nearby public park. Using their data, students evaluated the frequency of native birds species on campus and compared this to the frequency of bird species at a local park. Using their understanding of evolutionary concepts, students hypothesized about the reasons for the results of their data. Based on their conclusions, students made recommendations about how an open space on campus should be modified in order to better support the native bird population. The results of this study showed that project based learning is effective for teaching complex science concepts and promoting the learning and use of scientific practices."

69764	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2779	The effect of incorporating the science writing heuristic approach to inquiry activities in a high school science classroom	Students often come to a high school science classes without the skills they need to be successful in an inquiry based science class. These skills include the ability to write about science procedures and findings, read about and connect science content, and work collaboratively through science inquiry processes. This research used the Science Writing Heuristic to provide students with a template for inquiry based activities. With the SWH, students worked collaboratively on in inquiry based activity and then wrote about the science they did including procedures, observations, data, and results. Students then compared their findings with the findings of other groups. They used this information to make a claim about the content and supported the claim with evidence or data. Students were then asked to make a connection between the content and the activity through a reading assignment that explained the concept further, described a model of the content, or was a real-world application of the content. The goal of SWH was to improve students' understanding of science by reading, writing and collaborating about science. After a nine week pre-treatment and treatment phase data was collected to compare the skills students had gained and to determine if their understanding of science content had improved. Various methods were used to collect and analyze data including student surveys, field notes with observations about student collaboration, exam, quiz and lab grades, and a teacher reflective journal. Based on the data gathered, the students' ability to collaborate improved and they learned more through guided collaborative work. Student quiz grades did not change based on the SWH template, but exam grades did improve. The reading component of the SWH template did not produce the results I expected and students did not relate the reading to any of the content questions and many students did not read the assignments. In conclusion, the SWH approach provided me with information I can use as a teacher in the future. Despite the approach not being a complete success, parts of it can be used to help increase the skills students need to be successful in a science classroom.

Prior to this treatment, students spent the majority of their academic time indoors. In past years, students were becoming less and less motivated in their science courses as the school year wore on. Students seemed apathetic at times, disinterested, and did not believe that the science they were learning had any relevance to their daily lives. The purpose of this study was to gather evidence from students who were frequently exposed to the outdoors to see if they will be more motivated and display higher levels of achievement than students who spend the majority of their academic time indoors. Data Collection Instruments for this study included an Outdoor Attitudes Questionnaire, a Science Motivation Survey, Time on Task Check Sheets, Pre and Post Assessments, informal Student Interviews, Student Journals, and a Teacher Field Journal with daily reflections and observations, all included in the appendices for review. The data gathered from this study indicated that a positive relationship existed between the amount of time students were engaged outdoor activities and their level of motivation. Results from this study suggest that higher levels of student motivation lead to greater student achievement. The data from this study also support the conclusion that students felt less stress when exposed to the outdoors, and this reduction in stress resulted in more positive feelings toward their educational experience.

Since students learn best when they make connections between scientific concepts and real-world issues that interest them, integrated science service learning is an effective and engaging way to teach. My fifth grade students at National Presbyterian School in Washington, DC learned about climate change through a service learning project to help the environment on campus. My class of 28 fifth-graders investigated environmental variables affecting our campus. They brainstormed ways they could help the environment and decided to focus on reducing idling in the school carpool lane. Students researched the relationship between automobile exhaust and climate change, acid rain, and health. Students crafted a tally sheet to record the number of cars and their idling times. Over an average week with pleasant weather, 35 of 165 cars (22%) which arrived early for carpool idled for a total of 509 minutes. This put out 75 kg of the greenhouse gas, CO â, and cost $34.00 in fuel. Students used this research to develop an anti-idling campaign, which they presented to the whole student body and posted on the school website and e-newsletter. Students showed improvement on climate science knowledge and realized typical or better marks on benchmark assessments. They also became more confident in their knowledge, moving from an average 3 before the project to an average 8.5 afterwards on a 10-point Likert scale. Students also demonstrated a change in their view of science. Before the project they drew chemists with bubbling test tubes but after the project they drew themselves as a variety of different scientists helping to solve problems in the world. This project attests that science service learning can make science more concrete and relatable, teaching students not only about the concepts and techniques of science, but its role as a tool for the public good.

This project looked at the effect of using brain-based strategies in the classroom on understanding, motivation, and long-term retention of biology concepts. This project spanned three units in two biology classes. The first unit was taught using traditional lecture, videos, diagramming activities, and PowerPoint shows. The other two units incorporated brain-based strategies such as team building activities, positive feedback, use of multiple intelligences, and student choice. Pre- and post assessments were used to evaluate student learning and constructed response essays were used to determine long-term retention of concepts. Student attitude surveys along with pre- and post interviews were used to determine whether there was an increase in motivation as a result of treatment. Overall, the use of brain-based strategies had a positive effect on student understanding, motivation and long-term retention of biology concepts as well as had a positive impact on the classroom environment and peer interactions.

Learning academic vocabulary can be just as difficult as learning a new language. In order to help students build a strong foundation for science content and literacy in a classroom with mixed abilities and languages, this action research focused on differentiated vocabulary strategies. Students were divided into three groups based on proficiency level in the classroom and English Language Learner status. Four vocabulary strategies were implemented repeatedly during a four-week unit on Evolution. Strategies varied in level of cooperative grouping and modality. Although no increase in average test scores were measured, the strategies utilized did increase student understanding of content vocabulary. It was found that each student group responded differently to each vocabulary strategy. Overall, the majority of students expressed preference for fewer words and concepts, more study time and repetition, addition of illustrations and other visuals, and work in small cooperative groups.

Students participated in a series of discussion board topics. Data were collected by analyzing scores on pre and post assessments, surveys, interviews, and discussion board data such as number of posts. In addition to the effectiveness of these discussions, the study aimed to determine how involved the instructor should be in the discussions. As the instructor, I varied my level of participation throughout the study. The use of discussion boards showed little impact on learning the content. Students preferred and discussions were more in-depth when the teacher was an active participant in the discussions.

Many teachers either struggle with using inquiry learning or believe they are using inquiry learning due to lack of understanding. This paper set out to consider the effectiveness of guided inquiry in the middle school physics classroom. This project spanned a total of two months, where students were taught introductory physic concepts using one investigation that used traditional methods of instruction and three investigations using guided inquiry learning. Data collected identified the effects on understanding content, long-term memory, and student and teacher motivation using preunit, postunit, and delayed assessments, interviews, concept mapping, surveys, teacher journaling, and peer teacher observations. The study results were mixed. Understanding content and concept mapping had a positive impact on guided inquiry learning in general, while long-term memory showed mixed results. Data also indicated that guided inquiry increased student and teacher motivation.

69778	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2795	The effects of science fairs on students' knowledge of scientific inquiry and interest in science	The purpose of this capstone project was to determine if science fairs increase students' knowledge of scientific inquiry and build positive attitudes towards the study of science. This topic was chosen because students in the sixth through eighth grade participate in a school-sponsored science fair each year. Therefore the effectiveness of using science fairs as a method of teaching scientific inquiry and promoting interest in science was tested. Students were given a pre-test on scientific inquiry before the science fair and a post-test on scientific inquiry after the science fair. Then these test scores were compared. Students were also given surveys to complete before and after their participation in the science fair to determine if their attitudes changed towards the study of science. Samples of students from each grade were also interviewed before and after the science fair. Other sources of data were questionnaires completed by teachers at the school. These data were collected in a six-month time span. This capstone project determined that the science fair increased knowledge of scientific inquiry in students, but not for all students. Students' attitudes play a role in what they find relevant and want to learn. The science fair was successful in promoting more positive attitudes towards the study of science for students who visited the fair. Participants who showed a more positive attitude towards the study of science were only students who previously expressed interest in science before their participation in the science fair.

Students in junior level Conceptual Science at Manteno High School consider science irrelevant and are not motivated to learn the content. The goal of this research project was to incorporate a learning strategy that would increase student perception of the relevance of science to their lives and thereby increase their learning of the content. Case studies were incorporated into the two sections of Conceptual Science at Manteno High School for two units during the spring semester of 2013. Pre- and post- assessments were given to the students to measure their understanding of the content. An online survey was given to the students before and after the intervention to see how it affected their perception of relevance. Student interviews were conducted following the treatment as well. Evidence collected during the study showed that while student learning increased during units when case studies were used, the perception of relevance of science was virtually unchanged. Students expressed in the survey and in the interviews that they like using the case studies in class because they feel it connects science to the real world even though no measurable difference in their perception of relevance of science was observed through the Likert style survey. Using case studies in a class like Conceptual Science increases student interest enough that it increased their learning. Even though student perception of relevance of science is unaffected, incorporating additional case studies in science courses should be considered because of the increase in learning.

69780	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2797	Textbook reading strategies in the middle school science classroom	The majority of middle school students have not been specifically taught strategies to read textbooks. My goals were: to determine whether learning a textbook reading strategy would improve the students' understanding of the content, to measure any shift in attitudes towards reading textbooks after being taught specific strategies, and to evaluate any effect that teaching these strategies might have on my teaching. Many of my middle school science students struggled to locate information within their textbook during coursework. This impacted their reading assignments, which were rarely read, and homework assignments, which had low scores. The Common Core Standards mandate that technical writing and reading of informational text be incorporated into science curriculum. Two textbook reading strategies, THIEVES (Manz, 2002) and PLAN (Radcliffe, Caverly, Hand, & Frank, 2008), have been used successfully with middle school students. Over the course of four units, teaching of the reading strategies was alternated with using no reading strategy. The quantitative data that were collected included; test scores, quiz scores, homework scores, and final class grades. The qualitative data that were collected included; student surveys before and after learning the reading strategies, student interviews, and my own journaling. This study's findings were that quiz and test scores remained relatively consistent throughout the investigation, but homework scores did show an improvement during the final unit that used the PLAN reading strategy. Final academic grades remained the same for some of the students, while most students' grades improved or declined. Survey results indicated that students shifted from extreme feelings about reading textbooks, i.e. that they either loved or hated reading them, to having more neutral feelings about reading textbooks. The majority of the students preferred the PLAN reading strategy because they felt that it made them more familiar with the content and that their final product in their science notebooks had value to them, as it aided them in studying for tests. I also preferred PLAN due to the ease of teaching the strategy, the writing component that is built into the reading strategy, and the creative final product from the students.

In this investigation a mixed approach to vocabulary instruction was implemented within a seventh grade life science classroom. This mixed approach included semantic mapping of unit vocabulary words, morphology and textbook reading strategy lessons, which were utilized instead of my standard curriculum. The results showed no statistical difference in the median of any of the data collection instruments from pre to post-test or between treatment and non-treatment groups. The treatment increased student comprehension of the unit concepts, but no more than the standard curriculum.

This new condition of childhood has many negative ramifications, such as poor social development, childhood obesity, and a lack of feeling connected to the environment. One instructional tool being used by some schools to address these rising concerns is a school garden. School gardens can provide an opportunity for students to experience learning in a real-world application, outside of the classroom walls. This qualitative multi-case study explores three school gardens in Southwest Montana and tells each of their unique stories. Through the process of participant observation, interviews, and the collection of multiple data sources, a thorough description is given of the history behind the gardens, how they have impacted the teachers and students, what challenges they have faced, and the common characteristics found in a successful school garden program. During the data analysis process, themes for each case study site were revealed. The results of this study found that each school garden was unique in character and purpose and that a number of dedicated garden supporters are essential to the success of a garden program. In conclusion, suggestions and resources were provided for practitioners interested in pursuing a garden program.

A three-week unit including the history of evolution, steps of natural selection, and evidence supporting the theory was used as the nontreatment unit and taught using regular teaching strategies. This was followed by a three-week treatment unit covering genetic variation, distribution, and speciation, and included metacognitive strategies like reflection journaling, QUAD notes, and peer justification. Data was collected using preunit and postunit assessments, student reflection journals, surveys, interviews, and teacher reflections. While the intervention seemed to have little or no effect on student understanding, student attitude, and teacher enthusiasm, it did improve student retention of concepts over time. It would seem that the use of metacognitive strategies led to a longer, more durable learning experience.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']
69784	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2802	The effects of intervention strategies on student awareness of science homework completion	The purpose of this action research project was to develop student awareness about late and missing assignments. The reason for developing student awareness was to help increase homework completion rates. Teacher interviews and surveys were used to determine what types of intervention strategies have been successful in the classroom to increase student awareness of homework completion. Two recurrent intervention strategies were selected from these interviews and surveys to create student awareness of how not completing assignments can affect the overall grade. The first strategy required students to fill out a grade sheet of the assignments, due dates, points each assignment is worth, and an area to record any missing assignments as a reminder for students to improve the total amount of homework completed. The second intervention strategy was to send an electronic progress report to parents that gave a grade-by-grade weekly progress report of how well the student was doing in class for the chapter that was covered. Both intervention strategies helped develop awareness of homework completion with the weekly progress report having slightly more influence in developing student awareness and completing more homework assignments by the due date. There was an improvement in the overall average grade in all classes; however, this improvement was not a result of turning more homework on time, but rather more late homework was turned in for a grade.

"English Language Learners in fourth and fifth grade often express poor attitudes towards science class due to limited English. Lack of English rather than science content knowledge seems to be the deterrent for their success on formal science assessments. I worked with first grade English Language Learners using inquiry-based learning to improve students' attitudes towards science class. Students were engaged in open-ended, student-centered language building activities. Students constructed their own knowledge in teams and explored topics they felt interesting. Quantitatively there was not a significant difference in the students' academic performance. Comparing the inquiry-based learning with a more ""traditional"" teacher-centered, scripted approach, there was a statistically significant difference in the students' attitudes towards the inquiry-based lessons. English Language Learners need this less formal approach where they can work together to build their knowledge. Working cooperatively, the students practice the informal science language associated with the content without the added pressure of speaking up in front of the teacher or the whole class. Teachers of English Language Learners should expand their own content knowledge as well as work towards being an inquiry-based teacher to provide less stressful learning environment for their Limited English students."

Data collected prior to the control phase of this research showed that 61% of the students in Algebra I classes at E. J. King High School completed less than 90% of their homework. With the development of newer technology and the exponential growth of Internet use, teachers have looked for ways to incorporate these into their classrooms. As a means to increase homework completion rates, test and quiz scores, and student confidence in algebra, a research study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the flipped classroom. In a flipped classroom, the day's lesson was recorded as a video and posted online for the students to watch as homework. Students took notes and completed a couple of practice problems to receive full credit for a homework assignment. Problems traditionally done for homework were then assigned as class work. Results from this study showed an increase in homework completion rates, test scores, and student confidence in regards to algebra.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

The project was designed to assess whether students who were required to access information needed in class by using a teacher created website showed academic improvement. Data on student and parent perceptions regarding the efficacy of the website were also measured. The intent was to see if students could become more independent learners as they are being prepared to enter the high school system in the fall of 2013. The results of this study demonstrated that there was a modest improvement in overall academic achievement of students required to use the website compared to those who did not. Parent and student perceptions regarding online education were more difficult to measure quantitatively due to low numbers of surveys returned. Qualitative methods led me to conclude that the website was not only effective, but it gave students a chance to experience mixing their academic expectations with their frequent use of online tools. Parents informally reported that the website provided a platform for them to oversee their student's academics while allowing the student to maintain some degree of autonomy.

A restructured curriculum was implemented to emphasize the 5E learning cycle model. Student assessments, surveys, and interviews were analyzed to see the change in student learning and motivation. Teacher journals, observation, and surveys were analyzed to see the change in teacher attitude. Results did not reveal an overall change in student learning, however student perception of their learning and motivation did improve. Teacher motivation and attitude improved but at the expense of time.

The purpose of this action research-based classroom project was to study the effects of planning and preparing for lab compared to not preparing for lab and how that affected student achievement. Students took part in four labs where they prepared ahead of time, and four labs where they were given the lab procedures the day of the investigation and asked to complete their work. Student achievement and success were measured using questionnaires, surveys, and teacher observations during labs. There were eighteen Bellevue High School students in the accelerated chemistry class who participated in this study. During both treatments, the students were engaged in labs and indicated that they felt comfortable with the material that they were learning in class and how it compared to the lab experiment. When students prepared on their own for lab they consulted books, YouTube, the internet, and peers more than they did when they didn't have to prepare on their own. The results indicated that students were more successful, comfortable, and prepared for lab when they prepared on their own vs. when they were given the lab procedures the day of class. Although the students were more successful and comfortable when they prepared, this study also indicated that students enjoyed the hands-on experience during all labs.

My 8th grade Earth science class worked on three chapters during the project. During the chapter on atmosphere the students did all assignments alone. During the chapter on meteorology the students did all of their assignments with a randomly selected partner. During the chapter on climate the students did all of their assignments with a randomly selected group of four. The data from surveys given to the students showed that they preferred to work with a partner or in a group. However, data from cumulative class GPAs taken before the project started and compared to cumulative class GPAs from each chapter showed GPAs going down. The largest decline was during the pair work chapter on meteorology, followed by the group work chapter on climate, and finally the individual work chapter on atmosphere. In conclusion, the students preferred to work with a partner or in a group, however, their cumulative class GPAs showed that they did better work on their assignments when they worked on them alone.

This Action Research endeavor looked at seven teachers as they were trained and subsequently asked to utilize two Classroom Assessment Techniques in their individual classrooms and record information on their successes, failures and ideas. It was found that teachers were willing to implement new formative assessment techniques provided they took little time to prepare, implement and analyze. However, the information gathered from the formative assessments did not necessarily lead to a change in instructional technique. The project also showed that the level of engagement in the project was correlative with the number of relationships each teacher had with the individual leading the professional development.

In this investigation, guided-inquiry labs and class activities were implemented with the purpose of improving student understanding in high school chemistry. Process Oriented Guided-Inquiry activities, guided-inquiry labs, and online investigations were completed during the stoichiometry and gas laws units in two chemistry classes with 57 students. Pre and postunit assessments, pre and postunit student interviews, pre and postintervention student surveys, unit tests, instructor field observations, colleague observations, instructor weekly journaling, and pre and postintervention teacher surveys were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Overall, students showed increased conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills, with low and middle-achieving students showing the most growth in those areas. While postunit assessments and unit tests did not show measurable improvement in higher order thinking skills following intervention, students demonstrated increased engagement during class activities. Both the students and the teacher also experienced an increase in motivation as a result of the guided- inquiry intervention. The results of this study encourage increased use of guided inquiry in all units of chemistry and the rewriting of existing labs and activities to promote more higher-order thinking and student-directed learning.

An additional area of focus was the effect games had on classroom climate. Prior to treatment, classroom games were not used in the classroom. Data Collection Instruments consisted of a Classroom Attitude Survey administered before and after treatment, assessments before and after treatment, student interviews and a teacher journal of reflections and observations. A variety of games were used during the teaching of a unit on digestion and at the end as a review before the summative assessment. The results showed little improvement in content understanding or student stress. An improvement in classroom climate was observed with students arriving on time to class with an excitement to play the games.

The purpose of this study was to implement Interactive Science Notebooks with the intention of improving student success in science. The notebook intervention format involved metacognitive strategies including student-designed reflect and connect pages. Data collection instruments included a Likert-style student confidence survey taken pre- and post-study, summative test score comparisons, teacher reflective journal notes, classroom assessment techniques, rubrics for student notebook entries, student and focus group interviews. The use of the interactive science notebook encourages independent thinking, metacognition, and student confidence in science. The results indicate that when students utilize the Interactive Science Notebook they are more confident in their academic skills, they are more organized, and they perform better on summative assessments. As a result of using the notebooks students demonstrate a stronger capacity to retrieve and apply the information in a variety of settings including real-life applications. When students are using the notebooks the teacher feels satisfied that her students are participating in an authentic and effective learning experience.

The project was implemented over a seven week period. The first treatment phase asked students to use the PBL process to actively engage the first two weeks of the ecology unit content. Students gathered data on a local invasive species, buckthorn, and then developed a PBL artifact, in the form of a scientific paper. The second phase consisted of three weeks of non-treatment instruction that adhered closely to traditional passive learning instructional and learning practices. The third and final phase again asked students to use the PBL process to actively engage the two week evolution unit constructed around a PBL case study, ""The Galapagos,"" developed by Herreid & Schiller (1999). Through the analysis of data collected, I was able to determine that students enjoyed their increased role in the course and the parallels of PBL to the true nature of science made possible through the PBL active learning process. Students were able to show marked improvement on non-traditional assessments without negatively impacting performance on traditional assessments. All in all, students responded positively on the Likert surveys that they would like to continue learning concepts via PBL."	['science', 'biology', 'life sciences']

How did the increased exposure to nonfiction reading affect students' attitudes towards science and students' attitudes towards reading nonfiction? After students were given opportunities to read nonfiction books related to the topics of study in science class, data was collected and analyzed to determine if increasing nonfiction reading opportunities improved students' posttest scores or changed students' thoughts regarding nonfiction reading. After this short study, posttest scores indicated the additional nonfiction reading did not improve student content knowledge. The data did show however, an increase in the number of students that choose to read nonfiction books. Results of this action research project also indicated students thought reading nonfiction sources was important to gain knowledge and understanding of science topics.

In this action research-based project, I used multiple methods including student interviews, student attitude surveys pre and post treatment, and multiple teacher interviews to measure effectiveness of journal-use during a fifth-grade science-specific field trip. It was also determined if journal use during this science-specific field trip allowed a measurable result in improved attitude towards science in general. Upon conclusion of the data reviewed, the results indicated journal-use is effective in increased awareness and improved attitude towards scientific thinking.

The students used simulations and virtual labs to learn concepts in electricity such as Kirchhoff's laws and electrostatics. The data collection instruments included pre and postunit assessments, surveys, concept interviews, self-evaluation, and observation by a colleague to determine the effects of using guided inquiry with technology in the understanding and long-term memory of physics concepts, students' interest, attitude and motivation, and attitude of the teacher. There was an increase in students' interest and motivation and also an increased enthusiasm and positive outlook on the part of the teacher after the treatment. The study of the effect of the treatments on concept understanding and long-term memory produced mixed results and was inconclusive.

This research was conducted over a span of six weeks. The three units covered during the course of this study were forces, work and simple machines, and energy. Collection instruments included student interviews, teacher assessments of the students' blogs, comparison of pretest and posttest scores, and student survey responses. Student participation, student blog responses, and blog quality all decreased over the course of this study although the student survey indicated a majority of students felt the quality of their blogs improved over time. Students indicated that they felt blogging did help them better understand Physical Science topics covered during the class. There was an increase between student pretest and posttests for each unit.

Group work activities were differentiated according to learner profile. Though performance on summative assessments did not show marked improvement following the treatment, the students did demonstrate improved formative assessment scores. The students also expressed a more positive attitude with regards to their level of self-confidence in the learning setting. A total of forty eight students from two regular chemistry classes were used as the sample for this study. The following instruments were used as the data collecting source: chapter test scores, percentage of completed homework assignments, student lab reports, student surveys, student interviews, parental surveys, teacher reflective journal, teacher survey, and teacher evaluation by the supervising administrator.

In the 5E model, students cycle through Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate phases of learning through the course of an entire curriculum unit. Each new phase builds upon and refers back to the previous phases. A nonintervention unit on chemical reactions was compared with two intervention units, stoichiometry and states of matter, which were taught according to the 5E model. While the data collected had mixed results as to the effect of the 5E model on student understanding of chemistry concepts, the data indicated that the 5E model may have a positive impact on student long-term memory of chemistry concepts. Students also became more engaged in the learning process during the intervention units, although they found the second intervention unit to be more challenging and frustrating. I was excited by the changes in my classroom, and frustrated when things did not go as planned. However, I look forward to trying to continue incorporating the 5E model into my teaching in the future.	['high school students', 'chemistry', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

Engineering has become an integral component of science education in the state of Indiana. Despite the recent inclusion of engineering standards in the Indiana's Academic Standards for Science, there is little information about how best to teach engineering in the science classroom. Ascribing to a belief that middle school students learn best from activities that engage them to the greatest degree, this study sought to determine what type of engineering activities seventh grade science students found most and least interesting. To ascertain an answer, students were presented with a sequence of four engineering lessons, two applied, or hands-on, and two virtual. Results were determined using data collected from pretests, posttests, student self-evaluations, student interviews, and a teacher self-evaluation. Initial results indicated a slight preference for applied activities.

This project examined the effectiveness of using a Plan, Do, Study, Act model in a Chemistry classroom to increase student scores. Plan, Do, Study, Act is a systematic method used in the classroom, involving the students in the planning and assessment of several Chemistry units. The classroom teacher and students spend time at the beginning of each unit planning how to study the material and then enact the plan. Frequent formative assessments are used to study how the plan is working and if adjustments are needed, the class will enact changes in the original plan. By examining the data collected with student surveys, exam scores and student interviews, it was found that this method of teaching increased the summative exam scores of the lower students, but not the class as a whole. I can conclude that by using Plan, Do, Study, Act in the classroom, the students at the bottom of the class gained a connection to the rest of the class, causing their performance to improve.

The study also looked into the effect of role-play on students' critical thinking, their motivation and attitude, as well as the teacher's motivation and attitude. During two treatment units students were assigned fictitious characters with an array of problems and situations and the students researched the assigned topic through the eyes of their character. At the end of each unit, students gathered for a debate that would take place while in character. A combination of pre and postunit assessments, surveys, interviews, pro and con grids, journal entries, and colleague observations were utilized to gather data about students and the teacher. Results showed an improvement in student understanding, critical thinking, and attitudes and motivation. The results also revealed an improvement in the teacher's attitude and motivation.

Teachers lecture the class and disperse information to all students at one time. The Thayer Method is an alternative learning model that has been used for over a century at West Point. A modified version of the Thayer Method was implemented in three Chemistry I Honors classes at Meade County High School. Students were given all notes and assignments prior to the beginning of the unit and were expected to prepare and practice the work prior to attending class. Assessment scores were compared between the three treatment classes and two non-treatment classes. In the treatment classes scores were at least nine percentage points lower on all assessments. However, student engagement increased during the implementation of this unit. The implementation of a longer study would be expected to yield more comprehensive results and I would expect, after an initial adjustment period, that assessment scores would increase.

The students used targeted, real-world, current events, and hands-on activities to facilitate their learning of scientific concepts. Many data collection instruments were used, including preunit, postunit, and delayed assessments, interviews, surveys, colleague observations, and a teacher's reflection journal. The study found students had a stronger grasp of the concepts after the treatment. However, the study showed mixed results regarding students' motivation.

Using surveys, interviews and communication logs, this study examined the usefulness of the Robotics Volunteer Training workshops using LEGO Mindstorms kits and software. The findings from this study showed that a positive, supportive environment can help volunteers overcome past fears and negative feelings toward science and technology and to become successful leaders of youth robotics activities. The research also revealed that takes ongoing support and communication from 4-H staff after the training workshop, in order for the robotics volunteers to gain enough knowledge to lead a youth robotics activity. How can we create a positive robotics training experience for 4-H volunteers? Will an experiential learning experience help volunteers to gain confidence, competence and expertise that they need to be leaders for youth robotics activities? Will these trained volunteers be motivated to carry out a youth robotics activity beyond the training?

Analyzing Fred Feldmanâs pure hedonism as discussed in Pleasure and the Good Life: Concerning the Nature, Varieties, and Plausibility of Hedonism, hedonistic egoism is defined as an extension of Feldmanian pure hedonism. Discussing the use of hedonistic egoism in modern society by certain societal groups, especially adolescents and young adults, as a means to seek freedom from certain societal authorities such as the law, or at least portions of it, the differences between negative and positive freedom are explored using Erich Frommâs Escape From Freedom. It is then argued that when hedonistic egoism is used by individuals to seek freedom, whether it be negative or positive, certain paradoxes arise. Firstly, negative freedom, if existent, will exist merely psychology while, secondly, so far that pleasure and pain act as new authorities and egoism is present, positive freedom becomes an impossibility.

A very few philosophers and social activists appear to be the only ones who have ever adopted the idea that one should, seemingly against his nature as a human being, seek to completely abandon his ânegative reactive attitudesâ, as P.F. Strawson coined them in Freedom and Resentment. The notion that one should suspend all negative reactive attitudes such as anger and resentment is based on the idea of determinism: that all events, choices, and actions are causally determined and thus they cannot happen in any other wayâevery event is predestined and must occur as part of an immutable sequence of events. Strawson does not refer to a specific type of determinism, but perhaps an explanation of the reasoning behind the main conception of determinism will be helpful.

Punishing a person prior to committing a crime is considered wrong due to the fact that the crime has not yet in fact been committed. It is punishing the innocent. Prepunishment, therefore, is morally abhorrent. In a series of recent papers, Saul Smilansky (2007, 2008a, 2008b) argues that compatibilists cannot, in any principled way, reject the temptation to prepunish, which shows compatibilism to be a much more radical view, since it runs counter to our ordinary moral intuitions. Further, Smilansky argues that the common-sense objectionânamely, that prepunishment is morally abhorrentâis unavailable to compatibilists because of the fact that one who has not yet committed a crime is a mere temporal matter bearing no moral significance (Robinson 2010, 590).

I will propose a Schadenfreude Objection to Sayre-McCordâs interpretation of Millâs argument and argue that unless it is deflected the Schadenfreude Objection will be devastating to Millâs argument. I will argue that the only way to deflect the Schadenfreude Objection is to deny the transitivity of goodness. I will conclude that by denying the transitivity of goodness we are no longer able to use Millâs theory to morally prescribe actions, although we can still use it to prove that happiness is a good.

69829	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2863	A Defense of Epistemic Intuitions	Since the very beginning, intuitions have played a crucial role in philosophical inquiry. When Socrates asks, âWhat is justice?â he appeals to an innate source of knowledge that inexplicably recognizes examples of justice, even those falling outside the constraints of a definition. Intuition, as this purportedly omniscient source has been deemed, appears not only to exist universally among people, but also to hold some sort of special weight in the evaluation of normative claimsâi.e. what the definition of justice should be. Likewise, epistemology in the analytic tradition employs intuitions in its conceptual analysis of knowledge. However, recent work in experimental philosophy, an emerging field that impresses the necessity of empirical data, threatens to overturn the foundations of traditional philosophy by proposing the unreliability of intuitions. According to data gathered by Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich in their paper âNormativity and Epistemic Intuitions,â intuitions are not universal and subject to 1) cultural variation, 2) socioeconomic variation, 3) previous philosophical exposure, and 4) the order in which cases are presentedâthat is, they are dependent on situational factors. Therefore, intuitions cannot be trusted to make normative epistemic claims. However, I plan to counter Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich by referencing the transparency of intuitions, proposed by Frank Jackson in his paper âOn Gettier Holdouts,â in order to reconstruct an understanding of intuition that does not threaten epistemology in the analytic tradition and, furthermore, can be reconciled with experimental philosophy. First, I will deconstruct Weinberg et al.âs argument that intuitions fail to satisfy the Normative Projectâthe division of epistemology dedicated to understanding how knowledge should be understoodâthrough their discussion of how intuitions vary. Second, I will explain Jacksonâs notions of transparent intuitions, representational structures, and the âintuition module.â The last sections of this paper will be dedicated to responding to Weinberg et al. and exploring the implications of experimental philosophy on the Descriptive and Normative Projects of epistemology.

In this paper I argue that a select few Medieval philosophers advanced the concept of the actual infinite from its largely Aristotelian conception to a stage that foreshadowed Cantorâs accomplishments. I emphasize, in particular, the contributions of the 13th century scholastic philosopher Robert Grosseteste, whose work in this arena seems especially under-recognized and deserving of tribute.

Until recently they have not been of interest to the public or critics. In an effort to validate animated documentaries as an art form and thus a genre for serious consideration, scholars are currently focusing on defining and categorizing animated documentaries. Unfortunately, this is resulting in overly restrictive boundaries that films must adhere to in order to fall into the animated documentary category.

The purpose of this study was to challenge those assumptions in light of observations on the intradigital proportions of the hands and feet of theropods compared to modern taxa. Linear measurements of elements from the hands of mammals and squamates, the feet of birds, and both the hands and feet of non-avian theropods were collected to observe clustering of taxa in morphospace. The evolution of each linear character was modeled for primates, birds, and non-avian theropods using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in the ""OUCH!"" software package. Brownian motion models were nearly universally rejected in favor of single and multi-optimum selection based models. Model testing indicated directional selection for the most proximal and distal non-ungual elements in each digital ray, and either stabilizing selection or brownian motion processes for intermediate elements. The results for models applied to non-avian theropods suggest selection for metacarpal proportions convergent with arboreal mammals, and proportions of the penultimate phalanx similar to the feet of birds that use clawed adhesion for vertical substrate use and predation. We propose that ""clinging"" as opposed to ""grasping"" is a more apt hypothesis for behavior leading to elongation of the penultimate phalanx, as is the case in most non-avian theropods. According to modeling results, microraptorine dromaeosaurids evolved proportionally long metacarpals relative to their manual phalanges convergently with birds, and were comparable to other non-avian theropods in pedal proportions. These results contradict previous hypotheses in the literature regarding arboreal substrate use within microraptorinae. The scansoriopterygid Epidendrosaurus was a slight outlier in both manual and pedal proportions from other non avian maniraptorans, but adaptation for an arboreal lifestyle in this taxon is not supported by this analysis. The ""Raptor Prey Restraint"" model for predatory behavior in deinonychosaurian theropods was rejected by this analysis, though it is likely that the evaluated traits fail to capture the necessary anatomical variation to more fully test this hypothesis."

Flipping means lecture content usually delivered in the classroom was instead presented through asynchronous videos via the internet in advance of class. This was done in a suburban high school chemistry course. Results from unit tests were analyzed to see the change in summative achievement; while student surveys and interviews were analyzed to see the change in students' attitudes toward chemistry. Results revealed no significant change in achievement with only marginal improvement in positive attitudes toward chemistry. Student comments and interviews showed that students did not have a positive response to using flipping to introduce new content but had a positive attitude towards using flipping in other roles.

Social science data makes up less than half that amount. The other, larger half is scientific data. While university libraries have made a considerable investment in social science data, little has been done about scientific data. If administrators, librarians, or others believed that more attention should be paid to scientific data, one of the suggestions that might naturally arise is that social science data specialists should be involved. Though some common ground between these areas should be acknowledged, the existence of very substantial differences must also be recognized. Those differences are especially significant because coping with them will require an investment of staff and financial resources by the data library.

Consequently, they seek ways to assess the value of their collections in relation to user needs. This study at a University seeks to understand what resources users (both faculty and graduate student) are citing in their research, the breadth of the information cited that is provided by the library, how the libraryâs proactive and reactive efforts might influence user satisfaction with the information resources provided, and how user perceptions align and differ from information realities. It takes a unique approach by comparing LibQual survey results and faculty and graduate student citation behaviors.

An introduction to NMR is given to provide experimental background and an understanding of the data analysis, followed by an overview of polymers and biofilms. The next chapters describe the experiments and results for biofilm growth in two different model porous media. The final chapter provides analysis of shear forces on the non-Newtonian fluid polyacrylamide. Biofilms are formed when bacterial cells attach to a surface and begin to grow in a phenotypically altered state. Observation of biofilm growth in porous media poses significant challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of the biofilm and the opaque nature of the surfaces on which biofilms form. In the experiments presented, displacement-relaxation experiments were performed while a biofilm grew in a model porous media positioned in the magnet. Separate analysis of the flow characteristics of the biofilm phase and the bulk fluid phase was possible within the same data set. The results indicate that convective flow did not occur through the biofilm and that biofouling of the pore space resulted in faster bulk fluid flow through the channels. Natural geological matter contains magnetically susceptible materials such as iron-bearing minerals and cannot be analyzed with a high-field NMR system. A benchtop low-field NMR system was used to perform relaxation measurements on highly magnetic natural geological sand samples mixed with sand and biofilm from a sand column reactor. Shorter relaxation times in the biofouled sample indicated the presence of a biofilm, demonstrating that low-field NMR systems can be used in the natural environment to test for the presence of biofouling. Polyacrylamide is often used in high-shear applications such as enhanced oil recovery and wastewater treatment. These shear forces could affect the structure, and thus the function, of the polymer. Rheo-NMR, a combination of rheology and NMR, was used to study the velocity field for polyacrylamide solutions in a Rheo-NMR Couette device under different shear rates. The data shows that the polymer exhibits shear thinning behavior.

A combinatorial multivalued map of the dynamics for each subset of the parameter range is computed using rigorous numerical methods and is represented via a directed graph. The dynamics is then decomposed into the recurrent and gradient-like parts by graph theoretic algorithms using an adaptive computation. The novelty of this thesis is to introduce a similar adaptive scheme in parameter space. Furthermore, it is proven that this scheme produces an output which is naturally coarser than the output of an original computation. Incorporating previous results, we make an estimate for the savings achieved by this adaptive scheme in the setting of a saddle-node bifurcation. Furthermore, we make an empirical comparison of how well our scheme approximates an original computation.	['science', 'mathematics', 'dynamics', 'mechanics, analytic']

Polymerase elongating along the DNA strand encounter frequent but short pauses which are incorporated into the transcription model as several traffic lights. These pauses result in a delay in the transcription time and a delay function is defined to quantify this effect. Numerical simulations of the PDE model are conducted using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DG) formulation. The entropy satisfying weak solution of the PDE model with a single pause is derived using the method of characteristics. This weak solution is used to show convergence of the DG formulation even though the flux function is not smooth. Once convergence of the DG solution is established for one pause, the numerical simulation for multiple pauses is used to calculate the delay due to the pauses and determine their effect on the overall transcription time. Preliminary parameter studies show a complex relationship between pause location and delay values. To determine the effect of pause clustering on protein production, an ongoing research goal is optimization of the delay function with respect to pause location. For preliminary work on this optimization problem, a DG formulation used to solve a sensitivity equation for a linear hyperbolic PDE with a spatial interface parameter is derived to gain insight for the more complicated nonlinear traffic flow PDE.

Many of these problems are based on matching geometric objects or finding paths through given points with polygonal curves. This work focuses on the study and application of polygonal curves with respect to the discrete Frechet distance. We look at protein backbone structure alignment, comparison, and simplification. Previous work has largely focused on using the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) distance measure. We build upon recent work demonstrating the benefits of the discrete Frechet distance in this area, and present the first alignment algorithm based on the discrete Frechet distance and compare our results with previous work. To address visualization, the chain pair simplification problem (CPS-3F) was proposed in 2008 to simultaneously simplify two chains with respect to each other under the discrete Frechet distance. The complexity of CPS-3F is unknown, so we present algorithms to address CPS-3F instances efficiently. We give a greedy backtracking heuristic and two factor-2 approximation algorithms for CPS-3F. We give empirical results for the heuristic and for one of the approximations, CPS-3F +. Further, we provide dynamic programming solutions for many other CPS-3F properties. Chain pair simplification based on the Hausdorff distance (CPS-2H) is known to be NP- complete, and we prove the constrained version (CPS-2H +) is also NP-complete. We then investigate the discrete map matching and discrete set-chain matching problems and variations of them. The map matching problem is to find a path in a graph with a minimal Frechet distance to a given polygonal line. The set-chain matching problem attempts to find another polygonal curve with nodes from a given point set. We prove the complexities of many of these problem variations when given a maximal number of vertices or points allowed, and when the paths are unique. Some of which are NP-complete and others we give a dynamic programming solution to. Finally, many of the algorithms that we developed have also been implemented and released as a software library, named The Frechet-based Protein Alignment & Comparison Toolkit (FPACT).

More recently, inventory appears to lack its typical periodicity, and herd numbers decline despite above-average cattle prices. Historically, producers responded to high prices by expanding herds and to low prices by contracting them. These expansions and contractions resulted in the cattle cycle. Yet, currently, the price of beef continues to increase and inventory numbers continue to decline. This thesis seeks to identify the factors responsible for the apparent change in producer response, and to determine whether or not inventory is still cyclical. Spectral analysis is used to examine the cycle and identifies the early 1980s as the point of change. Next, Granger causality tests and autoregressive distributed lag models are used to estimate national and state-level inventory responses to various factors. A change in producer response to feeder cattle prices, above-average hay prices, and expanded crop insurance use appear to be the primary factors that are causing changes in the cattle cycle.

One response of the coronal field to photospheric forcing is the creation of stress in the magnetic field, generating large currents and storing magnetic free energy. Using a topological model of the coronal magnetic field we will quantify this free energy. We find the free energy just prior to major flares in active regions to be between 30% and 50% of the potential field energy. In a second way, the coronal field may topologically restructure to form new magnetic connections with newly emerged fields. We use our topological model to quantify the rapid restructuring in the case of solar flare and coronal mass ejections, finding that between 1% and 10% of total active region flux is exchanged. Finally, we use observational data to quantify the slow, quiescent reconnection with preexisting field, and find that for small active regions between 20% and 40% of the total emerged flux may have reconnected at any given time.

Methods: Three-day diet records, body composition (DEXA scan), blood lipids, and performance measures were collected in redshirt football players (N = 15, age 18.5 Â± 0.6 yr) early season and after 8 wk of in-season training. Results: There was an increase (p < .05) from early-season to postseason testing for reported energy (+45%), carbohydrate (+82%), and protein (+29%) intakes and no change in the intake of fat. Fat intake was 41% of energy at the early-season test and 32% of energy at the postseason test. Increases (p < .05 for all) in performance measures, lean mass (70.5 Â± 7.7â71.8 Â± 7.7 kg), fat mass (15.9 Â± 6.2â17.3 Â± 6.8 kg), plasma total cholesterol (193.5 Â± 32.4â222.6 Â± 40.0 mg/dl), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL; 92.7 Â± 32.7â124.5 Â± 34.7 mg/dl) were measured. No changes were measured in triglycerides, very-low-density lipoproteins, or high-density lipoproteins. Conclusion: Increases in strength, power, speed, total body mass, muscle mass, and fat mass were measured. Cholesterol and LDL levels increased during the study to levels associated with higher risk for cardiovascular disease. It is possible that this is a temporary phenomenon, but it is cause for concern and an indication that dietary education to promote weight gain in a manner less likely to adversely affect the lipid profile is warranted.

Eight participants performed a high-force eccentric elbow-flexion exercise to induce muscle soreness and inflammation and then consumed carbohydrate (0.25 gÂ·kgâ1Â·hâ1) or an equal volume of placebo during hours 0â12 and 24â36 postexercise in a double-blind, crossover protocol. Muscle soreness; midbrachial arm circumference; blood glucose, IL-6, CRP, cortisol, and creatine-kinase (CK) activity; and maximal force production were measured preexercise and 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h postexercise. Plasma IL-6 increased, F(5) = 5.27, P < 0.05, 8 h postexercise, with no difference between carbohydrate and placebo conditions. Changes in muscle soreness, arm circumference, strength, and serum CK activity were consistent with small amounts of muscle damage and did not differ between conditions. The authors conclude that carbohydrate supplementation during recovery from soreness-inducing exercise does not influence the delayed IL-6 response temporally linked to inflammation or indications of muscle damage. Thus, increased carbohydrate consumption at levels consistent with recommendations for replenishing glycogen stores does not impair or promote the immune and muscle responses.

This study sought to determine if attenuation of the IL-6 response during a 32.2-km mountain trail race occurs for high compared to low ad libitum CHO intakes. IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatine kinase activity (CK) were analyzed from blood samples collected 12 h pre-, 0, 4, and 24 h post-race. Subjects were grouped into low (n =14, 0.4 Â± 0.1 g Â· kgâ1Â· hâ1) and high (n =18, 0.8 Â± 0.2 g Â· kgâ1 Â· hâ1) CHO intake groups. IL-6 0 h post-race (P < 0.05) was higher in the low (40.2 Â± 22.7 pg Â· mLâ1) compared to the high CHO group (32.7 Â± 22.1 pg Â· mLâ1). CRP and CK both increased post-race, but no differences were observed between groups. Attenuation of exercise-induced IL-6 is apparent across a range of CHO intakes.

This derivation permits an interpretation of Hegel in such a way that a moral structure of relations between two self-consciousnesses can exist. What would form a moral dimension of recognition? Delving further, what would be the nature of this inter-subjective context of morality?In this discussion, I claim that the morality of Spirit in Hegelâs master-slave dialectic is the recognition of another as a self-consciousness. This recognition, in turn, allows self-consciousness to become certain of itself as a being-for-itself. I argue that recognition is only possible with the psychological state I name the âslave mentality.â In order to derive recognition from the slave mentality, I will identify two psychological states in the dialectic. The first will be the primordial psychological state of self-consciousness, which precedes the initial and inevitable engagement of one self-consciousness with another. The second psychological state will be one that is fashioned in the enslavement of one self-consciousness by another, which will occur after the life and death struggle. Afterwards, I move beyond the dialectic and present a third psychological state, which I will determine to be the final psychological state that is necessary for Spirit and, consequently, for morality.

An Analysis of Three Community Forest Groups in Nepal	The introduction of community forestry in Nepal represents an attempt to decentralize control and instill democratic reform in the management of forest resources through the direct involvement of individuals in decision making and benefit sharing. Detailed analyses of community forest outcomes, specifically an understanding of the process of self-governance and the exercise of power, remains a critical gap. Using a purposive sampling methodology, we identified 38 forest users representing a diversity of interests in three communities of the middle hills of Nepal and conducted in-depth interviews focusing on perceptions of an ability to exercise power in forest management. Power in this context is defined as the ability to create rules, make decisions, enforce compliance and adjudicate disputes. Our results identify inferiority, vulnerability, and a lack of transparency as factors that keep forest users from exercising power. We conclude that while community forestry offers tremendous potential to practice self-governance, the behavior of individuals based on complex informal institutional arrangements, such as caste and gender, must be accounted for in such formalized policy initiatives. Opportunities to influence power through mandated processes alone fail to fully explain or affect the potential for community forestry. Instead, we note that genuine empowerment is related to capacities involving the skills and confidence necessary to exercise power.

This study details the development, delivery, and impact of a structured curriculum developed by the authors and used for citizen board training in Montana. The curriculum covers four key areas: (1) Foundations of governance (such as relevant statutes, including state constitutional provisions on the right to participate and right to know, and good governance principles); (2) effective meeting techniques, with a focus on procedural methods such as Robertâs Rules of Order; (3) conflict management; and (4) leadership and team-building skills. Curricular materials include a detailed handbook, case study exercises, relevant handouts and worksheets, and Web based resources such as podcasts. At the end of the training, we asked participants to self-evaluate their level of change in terms of knowledge and behavior, using both print and online surveys with Likert-scale items and open-ended questions. We used the responses to measure the impact of the educational program; analysis showed a positive change in participantsâ knowledge and behavior as a result of the training. Strengths, challenges, and implications of the current training curriculum, as well as further program refinement and its delivery in various contexts, are presented and discussed.

Students assessed their own learning through practice quizzes taken alone, with peers, and with notes. They recorded their mastery of learning objectives, assignment completion, and quiz scores on a portfolio. The hope was that students would become more invested in their own education and subsequently more successful through the use of these formative assessments. The participants in this study were lower-achieving students, the majority of which received special education services, social/emotional services, or both. Many of these students were only mainstreamed for biology. Summative quiz scores, summative test scores, and quarter grades from this year's classes were compared with similar data from last year's classes to determine whether or not the intervention improved student achievement. Survey, interview, and teacher observation data were used to determine whether or not the intervention improved student engagement.

Everest) National Park, Nepal	In this paper, it is argued that four distinct issues have prevented adequate management of toilets, water quality and sanitary conditions in Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) National Park. First, numerous interest groups, both government and non-governmental, have apportioned work requirements and responsibilities for the infrastructural obligations in the park thereby drawing accusation and criticism for unmet needs. Second, there lacks a strong sense of community in several of the densely populated and/or popular tourist sites and therefore these areas are either ill-equipped, do not have the necessary community will or all-together neglect certain public sanitation needs. Third, there is no regulatory body that consistently enforces sanitary rules from the original park management plan. Lastly, various development initiatives in the park have created a cycle of dependency and the expectation that sanitation structures will be built and maintained.	['public policy']

McSwiteâs challenge to become the new carrier of the social bond are formidable. This study argues that for public administration to successfully transition from a market-based bond to a social bond of discourse, it is the responsibility of citizens to first firmly established public discourse as a practice in civil society. This study asks: as a civic association, to what extent does a historical society have the capacity to reinvigorate the social bond? To answer that question this research uses a qualitative strategy in conducting an exploratory study of four rural Montana historical societies and their attendant museums. The findings show that rural historical societies, as active caretakers of community identity within the political realm of civil society, meet the benchmarks for the reinvigoration of the social bond: concern for community welfare; acknowledgement of a mutual dependence within civil society; recognition of a multiplicity of diverse views; and a commitment to public engagement in collaborative, consensus driven decision-making.

The ability to immobilize an individual bacterium opens up new research frontiers, as it not only enables us to conduct fundamental research on an individual living bacterium but also creates new opportunities for biosensor applications. A number of pathogenic organisms from Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli strains are used to develop bacterial immobilization, herein referred to as immunoimmobilization. Our findings suggest that the most efficient, specific and reliable immunoimmobilization hinges on the use of affinity-purified antibodies raised against bacterial surface antigens such as fimbriae, lipopolysaccharides, and flagella. This approach produces a full monolayer of densely packed living bacteria (limited only by steric hindrance) on an antibody-activated area on a flat surface. Immunoimmobilization does not influence the viability or cell replication of the bacteria. To the best of our knowledge, to this day this is the highest packing density of immobilized bacteria reported in the literature. For successful immobilization, a monolayer of antibodies with full freedom of motion must be covalently linked to a flat surface (typically a silicon wafer). This has been achieved through a carefully optimized series of chemical reactions. More importantly, it was essential to monitor the activated surface using surface-sensitive analytical techniques to verify each step of the linker chemistry. A new technique was developed for quantifying the initial rate of cell capture in terms of the number of bacteria immobilized per unit time per unit area per cell concentration in the physiological environment of the bacteria. This rate turned out to be (7.2 + or - 0.3) x 10 -6 cells/(min x (100 microns) 2)/(cells/mL) for S. Typhimurium, and (1.1 + or - 0.1) x 10 -6 cells/(min x (100 microns) 2)/(cells/mL) for E. coli, both expressing fimbriae. The lowest detection limit was ~3 x 10 4 cells/mL in 30 minutes of incubation. For the first time, immunoimmobilization studies were conducted in a number of Navy fuels, including biofuels. It was discovered that antibodies subjected to the fuel environment preserve their structure, functionality and stability. The immunoimmobilization process works as efficiently in fuels as in aqueous environments.	['microorganisms', 'bacteria', 'life (biology)', 'organisms', 'prokaryotes']

The lysine labeling CyDyes are limited by problems with over labeling resulting in protein precipitation and isoelectric point (pI) drift at high pH's. These limitations have been addressed by a family of highly water soluble and pI balancing zwitterionic BODIPY dyes, which were previously synthesized in the Grieco group. The absorbance maxima of the BODIPY fluorophores were tuned through extension of the pi system to produce a three color, spectrally resolved dye set. However the fluorescence of the green emitting BOPIDY suffered at pH's less than 3.5 and greater than 11, while the red emitting BODIPY was susceptible to Michael addition changing its emission profile. To address the limitations of the BODIPY family of dyes, a new family of zwitterionic 2DDIGE dyes based on the established CyDye fluorophores have been synthesized. A complete three dye zwitterionic minimal labeling set which features a cysteic acid motif, titratable amine functionality and an NHS activated ester group reactive towards lysine residues has been synthesized: Z-Cy2 (QY= 6.8% Â± 0.1, epsilon= 155,000), Z-Cy3 (QY= 11.1% Â± 0.4, epsilon= 124,500), Z-Cy5 (QY= 43.3% Â± 0.6, epsilon= 217,600). In addition, a complete three dye zwitterionic saturation labeling set which incorporates a cysteic acid motif and maleimide functionality reactive towards cysteine residues has also been synthesized: Z-Cy2-Mal (QY= 6.6 % Â± 0.1, epsilon= 104,500), Z-Cy3-Mal (QY= 12.4 % Â± 0.5, epsilon= 127,700), Z-Cy5-Mal (QY= 40.2 % Â± 0.4, epsilon= 217,400).

Building on the basic statistical thinking emphasized in an introductory course, a second course in statistics at the undergraduate level can explore a large number of statistical methods. This text covers more advanced graphical summaries, One-Way ANOVA with pair-wise comparisons, Two-Way ANOVA, Chi-square testing, and simple and multiple linear regression models. Models with interactions are discussed in the Two-Way ANOVA and multiple linear regression setting with categorical explanatory variables. Randomization-based inferences are used to introduce new parametric distributions and to enhance understanding of what evidence against the null hypothesis âlooks likeâ. Throughout, the use of the statistical software R is emphasized with all useful code and data sets provided within the text. This is Version 1.0 of the text that is an update of a book with a slightly different title from 2017. The final chapter connects many of the methods covered in the general framework of linear models before applying the methods to four case studies extracted from published papers.

This testing process was first investigated over 20 years ago, however it has been slow to develop due to the lack of understanding of the mechanical processes behind the heat generation and the inability to effectively control flaw heating. Vibrothermography is particularly suitable for composite materials due to their tendency to develop subsurface delaminations between laminating plies, which are undetectable using most other NDT methods. Increased use of composite materials in structures such as airplane components and wind turbine blades has contributed to a revived interest in vibrothermography. This paper investigates the use of the finite element analysis (FEA) method to model vibrothermographic systems. Physical samples of glass epoxy composites that contained large delaminations were tested using vibrothermography to create an empirical data set that is used to verify an FE model of a similar system The resulting surface temperatures in the FE model were compared to those observed in the physical test. Both the strengths and shortcomings of using FEA to model these systems are discussed and the proposals for how to improve the model accuracy are provided. The second of half of the paper describes the use FEA to create thermal models of vibrothermographic systems in order to generate a detection model that will indicate the excitation time required to detect a flaw according to it's size, depth, and heat generation rate. The model also accounts for measurement noise and camera distance, and is found to be accurate for flaws with short detection times, and less reliable for those with longer times. The connection between model accuracy and detection time is explained by the inherent issue of problem conditioning. Possible resolutions to this problem are described and further work is proposed on how to improve model accuracy.

Comparatively little information is available on the impact of these practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) in Montana's semi-arid climate. The objective of this research was to measure rates of change in SOC in cropland for north central Montana's Golden Triangle related to conversion of crop-fallow to annual cropping, conversion to no-till management, and the implementation of both simultaneously. A second objective was to measure differences in soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) as an ""early indicator"" for soil carbon accrual after six years of management. Field experiments were established at six farm sites in fall 2002. Soil organic C was not affected by the treatments at three of the six sites after six years (2002-2008). Three of the six sites had soil carbon accrual associated with annual cropping ranging from 0.19 to 0.53 Mg ha -1 yr -1. Only one site showed soil carbon accrual associated with no-till management, accruing 0.26 Mg ha -1 yr -1. It proved unreliable to make quantitative comparisons for samples from different collection times using SMBC because stored soil samples had diminished SMBC correlated with months in storage, making it impossible to compare accurately freshly obtained SMBC with earlier baseline values from stored soil samples. It was concluded that annual cropping is likely to increase SOC in many instances; however a longer study period may be required to understand SOC response to soil management in this region."

Midwives in Montana examines the historical context of the legalization of midwifery in Montana and identifies significant individuals, groups, and events in the confrontation over home birth in the state. Based on oral histories of legislative participants and drawn from primary and secondary source materials held by individuals and institutions throughout the state, this research compiles scattered documentary evidence to present the history of Montana midwives from territorial days through the legislative events of 1989 and 1991. The efforts of midwifery supporters in the Montana legislature prevailed over organized and well-funded opposition from individual physicians, medical organizations, and hospitals, and resulted in statutory changes that enabled the licensing of homebirth midwives. With a strong rural representation, the 1989 legislative body supported the availability of midwifery care for constituents unable to access urban medical centers. The lobbying strategy employed by midwifery advocates embodied a sophisticated understanding of the conflict between midwives and institutionalized medicine and utilized beliefs about gender and Montana identity to enable legislative success. Additionally, the individuals most closely involved in the lobbying process remained committed to a clearly defined agenda. As a result of their efforts, Montana became the ninth state in the nation to legalize and license homebirth midwives and remains a national leader in homebirth midwifery care.

The DIAL utilizes a custom-built lidar (light detection and ranging) transmitter system based on two commercial tunable diode lasers operating at 1.571 micron, an acousto-optic modulator, fiber optic switches, and an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier to generate 65 mJ 200 ns pulses at a 15 kHz repetition rate. Backscattered laser transmitter light is collected with an 11 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope where it is optically filtered to reduce background noise. A fiber-coupled photomultiplier tube operating in the photon counting mode is then used to monitor the collected return signal. Averaging over periods typically of one hour permit range-resolved measurements of carbon dioxide from 1 to 2.5 km with a typical error of 40 ppm. For monitoring a field site, the system scans over a field area by pointing the transmitter and receiver with a computer controlled motorized commercial telescope base. The system has made autonomous field measurements in an agricultural field adjacent to Montana State University and at the Kevin Dome carbon sequestration site in rural northern Montana. Comparisons have been made with an in situ sensor showing agreement between the two measurements to within the 40 error of the DIAL. In addition to the work on the 1.57 micron DIAL, this thesis also presents work done at NASA Langley Research Center on the development and deployment of a 2 micron integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar. The 2 micron system utilizes a low repetition rate 140 mJ double pulsed Ho:Tm:YLF laser developed at NASA Langley.

Two examples of important wireless internet infrastructure are long distance network backbone links and last-mile solutions to remote areas. Wireless technology already supplies a wide variety of consumer solutions including analog television channels (TVWS), cellular infrastructure for massive scale real-time communication, and computer networking for seamless global connectivity. Worldwide, there are an estimated 2.5B internet users and 6B cellular phone subscribers- and those numbers are steadily growing. Sufficient capacity for divergent wireless applications, along with their growing users, calls for a more efficient use of bandwidth. We present multiple resource allocation algorithms to address this challenge in various aspects of wireless networking. Each algorithm focuses on a single resource of wireless networking: antenna beam sector activation, directional antenna beam bearings and duration, joint routing and channel selection, and link-channel allocation. In terms of computation and memory, our topology control algorithms provide near optimal performance with significantly lower cost. For each algorithm, a rich set of simulation scenarios is presented that compare our novel algorithms performance to the optimal solution. Ultimately, we present a topology control algorithm that provides an efficient solution to the channel rental problem: finding the most cost-effective set of communication channels (for a wireless mesh network) at a minimum performance guarantee. This problem occurs in high-density traditional wireless networking, cellular networking, and rural sparse networking with last mile internet connectivity; topology control algorithms are well suited for all applications of wireless technology. These algorithms are shown to be robust against various network challenges including topology, frequency availability, and interference.

In the subsurface, this technology may help reduce unwanted preferential flow pathways thereby improving the storage security of geologically-stored carbon dioxide or sealing fractures caused by hydraulic fracturing. MICP has been researched for other applications, such as consolidating porous materials, improving construction materials and remediating environmental concerns. Injection strategies to control saturation conditions and region-specific precipitation were developed in sand-filled columns. Sporosarcina pasteurii biofilms were established and calcium and urea solutions were injected to promote mineralization. These injection strategies resulted in (1) promoting homogeneous distribution of CaCO 3 along the flow path, (2) minimizing near-injection point plugging, and (3) promoting efficient precipitation by reviving ureolytic activity. Additionally, a Darcy-scale model was calibrated and used to predict experimental results. The developed injection strategies were used to repeatedly seal a hydraulically fractured, 74 cm diameter Boyles Sandstone core under ambient pressures. To study meso-scale samples under relevant subsurface pressure conditions, a high pressure test vessel, rated to pressures of 96 bar, was developed. The hydraulically fractured sandstone core was loaded into the vessel and treated with MICP at 44 bar of confining pressure. After treatment, the permeability was reduced and the sandstone core withstood three times higher well bore pressures before re-fracturing compared to before MICP treatment. Additionally, MICP was promoted in three 2.5 cm diameter Berea Sandstone cores under 76 bar of pressure. The cores' permeabilities were reduced and their minimum capillary displacement pressures (MCDP) were increased. Exposure of the biomineralized cores to 24 hours of supercritical CO 2 did not negatively impact the permeability or MCDP achieved after mineralization. These studies suggest MICP may potentially seal and strengthen subsurface high permeability regions or fractures with the advantage that MICP technologies use low-viscosity fluids to penetrate small aperture pores that may not be reachable by traditional cement-based sealing technologies. These studies also point to the need for further research and development activities, particularly under subsurface relevant pressure conditions.

The size, weight, shape and economic considerations of wind turbine blades have dictated the use of low cost composite materials. Composite structure manufacturing quality is a critical issue for reliability. While significant research has been performed to better understand what is needed to improve blade reliability, a comprehensive study to characterize and understand the manufacturing flaws commonly found in blades has not been performed. The work presented herein is focused on performing mechanical testing of flawed composite specimen and developing probabilistic models to assess the reliability of a wind blade with defects. The analysis postulates that one should assess defects as a design parameter in a parametric probabilistic analysis. A consistent framework has been established and validated for quantitative categorization and analysis of flaws. Results from this effort have shown that the probability of failure of a wind turbine blade with defects, can be adequately described through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The two approaches detailed in this analysis have shown that, by treating defects as random variables, one can reduce the design conservatism of a wind blade in fatigue. Reduction in the safe operating lifetime of a blade with defects, compared to one without has shown that the inclusion of defects is critical for proper reliability assessment. If one assumes that defects account for some of the uncertainty in the blade design and these defects are analyzed with application specific data, then safety factors can be reduced. It has been shown that characterization of defects common to wind turbine blades and reduction of design uncertainty is possible. However, it relies on accurate and statistically significant data.

The 2011 growing season conditions were atypical beginning with above average precipitation in September and November. Winter precipitation was near average, while April through mid-June precipitation was much above average. Mid-June through August precipitation was below average. The Moccasin location was seeded in mid-April while the Denton was seeded in mid-May due to the wet spring weather. Ability to access the site quickly and using a double disk drill made if feasible to seed the Moccasin site much earlier than most spring seedings in the area. Leaf diseases were not an issue in spite of the wet May and early June weather due to the generally dry sunny conditions in mid-June through August. 2011 did not provide conditions for good evaluation spring crop performance potential. The late seeding coupled with abundant initial moisture followed by drought conditions led to shallow root placement and possibly reduced root growth. The warmer conditions at emergence may have reduced tiller numbers which resulted in improved test weight levels.

The Prototype Air Quality Decision Support System (AQDSS) discussed in this paper has limited its scope to portable sources to simplify the development process. Examples of portable sources are: Asphalt & Cement Concrete Batch Plants, and Crushing & Screening Plants. Portable Sources of Air Pollution are Subject to Various State and Federal Permitting Requirements Dependant Upon: the quantity and nature of emissions, the date of manufacture of equipment, the proposed location(s) and dates of operation, the hours of operation, as well as other factors that the decision support system (DSS) must address. An AQDSS for portable sources should accept air quality permit application data, and model the data to generate a recommendation. AQDSS permit recommendations are: Issue an Air Quality Permit (for a Portable Source), Issue with Permit Restrictions (Emission Limits, Hours of Operation Limits, Production Limits, ....), Application Incomplete - Request Additional Information, Do Not Issue Permit, Does Not Require Permit, Requires Operating Permit. An objective of this project, secondary to satisfying the requirements of a Master of Science Degree, was to construct a prototype AQDSS that attempts to satisfy the needs (requirements) of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Air Resources Management Bureau. With that perspective in mind, the AQDSS was intended to facilitate the issuance of air quality permits for portable sources, with the goal of improving DEQ response time and reducing engineer review time. The AQDSS should also, when fully completed, provide an opportunity for an air quality permit applicant to complete and submit an application online. A working prototype can also provide a useful template to expand the DSS to other types of source categories, as well as facilitate communication between the DEQ and the regulated community.

The application is envisioned as an environment where users with varied musical backgrounds can create music by 'sculpting' 3D objects that subsequently have their spatial characteristics mapped to sound parameters. The mapping between a 3D object and its sound involves using the object's silhouette to determine the shape of the ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain Release) sound envelopes associated with the object, thus affecting the object's sound parameters. The 3Dobjects with their associated sounds can then be used to build a 3D scene that represents a musical composition that the user can play. Manipulating an object's size, color, or position in the scene affects the volume, duration, and timbre musical parameters for that object. Literature relevant to the project is reviewed, similar available software products are surveyed and appropriate methodologies and technologies for implementation of the various project modules are proposed. Two different design environments are explored, one utilizing OpenGL and the other using the Smalltalk-80 implementation Squeak. A prototype with limited functionality that was developed in the Squeak environment is presented as a demonstration of Squeak's capabilities and as a visual representation of the project's concept.

In response to the demand for managing and storing large amounts scientific data, programmers at the Center for Computational Biology at Montana State University have developed client-side software that allows a user to access, edit, and query a remote database. To use this application the client computer must have a current version of Java installed, the application must be downloaded, and browser settings may need to be adjusted. While many of the end users are computer savvy, the setup process challenges other end users. The goal of this project was to develop a server-side, web-based interface for the application that allows users to browse, query, and edit a database by simply visiting a website and logging in. Principles of good design for user interfaces and interactive systems are reviewed and the resulting system is compared with three other database applications using these design principles as criteria. Results of the comparisons are summarized and recommendations for future work on the project are made.

The SE algorithm begins with a random initial solution or with a previously found good solution to the problem and simulates the evolution process by eliminating the bad characteristics of the older generation resulting in an improved newer generation solution. The SE algorithm achieves this using functions and operations which test the suitability of characteristics for the existing environment. Each characteristic of a species in the current generation has to prove its suitability under the existing environmental conditions in order to remain unchanged in the next generation. This process is repeated until a certain number of iterations is completed or until no significant improvement is noticed and the solution to the problem is obtained. In this project, the SE algorithm is studied and implemented to solve the very large scale integration cell placement problem, and the quality of the solutions and the running times of the algorithm are compared with those generated by the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. The SE algorithm after experiments shows that it produces results that are comparable to the results that were generated by the SA algorithm. The SE algorithm seems to be suitable in cases where the size of the input is considerably large. The SE algorithm starts consuming more time than the SA algorithm as the size of the input increases. The feature in the SE algorithm which increases the number of trials if the newer generation is better than the older could increase the running time of the SE algorithm considerably.

This trial was set up on both winter wheat and spring wheat. A farm scale exhaust injection system was used to establish wheat adjacent passes in fields of winter wheat and spring wheat. The first seeding pass was done without injecting the exhaust. The idea was to not have any fresh exhaust residues in the system when seeding the untreated check pass. The second pass was made with the exhaust injector system in operation. No start up fertilizer was placed with the seed. The moisture from the exhaust causes the granular fertilizer pearls to gum and build up on the opener. Therefore no starter fertilizer (NPK or S) was placed with the seed. Liquid N was applied sequential applications of 4 gallons per acre of 28-0-0 (11.2 lbs N)and 5 gallons of 24-0-0-0 ( 12.0 lbs N). This initial evaluation of injecting diesel exhaust into the soil along side the seed did not result in any positive results.

As naturally occurring resident antagonists, they can be managed or exploited to achieve the desired results. They are responsible for the âcrop rotation effect,â which is possibly still the single most important disease management tool used worldwide. On the other hand, the addition of organic materials such as compost, barnyard manure, and green manure is known to intensify the soil-sanitizing benefits of resident antagonists so much that it is sometimes possible to eliminate the need for crop rotation. Entomology is commonly used as the standard for success with biological control agents introduced into the environment. Compared case-for-case, plant pathology is a barely-visible distant second to entomology. In fact, we would have to say it is a distant third, since there are more successful cases with introduced biological control agents of weedsâherbivorous insects and pathogensâthan of plant diseases. On the other hand, if we narrow the comparison to biological control with introduced micro-organisms, plant pathology begins to look quite respectable. Examples of biological control sparked the current and much more successful effort with plant-associated microorganisms as agents introduced for biological control of plant pathogens.

Pseudomonas aureofaciens AB254 and Pseudomonas sp. AB842 were used for control of P. ultimum and P. oxalicum, respectively. Metalaxyl seed treatment for control of P. ultimum was used at rates from 100 to 0.01% of the recommended rate either alone or in combination with P. aureofaciens AB254. Imazalil seed treatment for control of P. oxalicum was used at rates from 100 to 1% of the recommended rate either alone or in combination with Pseudomonas sp. AB842. In field tests, combining a chemical treatment with the biological agent did not affect the efficacy of disease control. Nor did combining low rates of chemical with the biocontrol agent increase the efficacy or reliability of disease control.

The Geraldine site was abandoned due to variable stand establishment. The site was a no-till fallow site where the surface soil was strongly crusted. However, once through the crust the moist soil went to a depth greater than 48â. Sufficient moisture was received to sprout the seed, but insufficient to sustain some seed till the roots could penetrate the crusted surface and the seeding died. The farmer used an air seeder with hoe openers and had excellent stand establishment. The soil at the Winifred site was less crusted, but stand establishment and seedling growth was not as good as the farmer had around the plots. Early May spring moisture was good. However, the winter wheat crop ran out of moisture during grain fill causing the test weights to be light and erratic. The information generated is weak due to variation across the nursery.

Rhizosphere bacteria that adhered to hyphae of P. ultimum and were antagonistic to the growth of this pathogen were isolated from Bitterroot Valley soils. An isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens, AB254, provided superior seed protection from Pythium damping-off in naturally infested soils. At least 1 X 100,000,000 cfu per seed of AB254 was needed to achieve maximum protection. In a process we have termed âbio-priming,â dry seed was coated with P. fluorescens AB254 and allowed to imbibe water under warm temperatures until a 35-40% moisture content was achieved. During bio-priming, bacterial populations increased from 10 to over l0,000Â­-fold, depending on initial inoculum level. Bio-priming provided protection against damping-off as good as or better than seed treatment with metalaxyl when the seeds were planted in cold soil. This process may be of interest and value to growers who wish to plant sweet corn or other temperature-sensitive crops into cold soils where damping-off is a problem and the use of chemical seed treatments is not desired.

Center on land in its eighth year of continuous no-till annual cropping (since 1996).

Soil moisture conditions were fair to good at seeding. conditions were fair to good at seeding (soil moisture probe depth 10-12â). However, high post seeding temperatures and winds dried the soil late into the fall. Much above average April precipitation contributed to excellent yield potential. Return of severe drought conditions in early June resulted low test weights which deflated the yield levels. The droughty weather in combination with the variable shallow soils resulted in extremely variable yield results and low confidence results. No-Till recrop weather precipitation conditions were such that early maturity was favored. The later the maturity the greater the exposure to increased heat and reduced plant available moisture. The main factor missing was winter stress. The good performance of several numbered lines indicate the potential for improved varieties in the near future.

This private ownership has helped make many citizens rich throughout the countryâs history from strikes of precious metals and other minerals, as well as hydrocarbon resources. As the United States enjoys a Renaissance of oil production amidst the current high price environment, the ownership of oil and natural gas resources has reemerged as a critical economic force. Although private oil and gas ownership is acknowledged as an important contributor to innovation in development of unconventional resources and the technologies used to produce them (Yergin 2011), little is known about the aggregate value of private mineral interests. Usually private minerals are leased to developers in exchange for a royalty paid on the basis of gross production revenue as oil and natural gas are extracted. In this paper we estimate aggregate private oil and gas royalty incomes in recent years. The United States is the only country in the world with widespread private ownership of minerals. This private ownership has made many U.S. citizens rich throughout the countryâs history from strikes of precious metals and other minerals, as well as hydrocarbon resources. As the United States enjoys a Renaissance of oil production, the ownership of oil and natural gas resources has reemerged as an important factor in determining the course of the energy industry. Private oil and gas ownership is acknowledged to be an important contributor to innovations in the development of unconventional resources and the technologies used to produce them (Yergin 2011). Little is known, however, about the aggregate value of private mineral interests or the annual income derived from them. Private minerals typically are extracted under the provisions of leases with developers that specify the royalty rate to be paid on the gross revenues from the production of oil and natural gas. In this paper we estimate private oil and natural gas royalty gross incomes in recent years, for the continental United States and the individual states therein. Our estimates indicate that in 2012 an estimated 77 percent of oil and natural gas revenue from onshore sources in the lower 48 states was from private minerals. These are substantial pieces of an extremely large pie. We estimate that in 2012 total gross revenue from oil and natural gas production exceeded $220 billion for all U.S. onshore production. This represents about 1 percent of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The corresponding value of production from private minerals was about $161 billion in 2012, of which private royalty owners were paid $22 billion in gross compensation for their mineral property. At the state level, the largest private oil and gas royalties were received (in descending order) from production in Texas, California, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. These are states with a high proportion of private minerals, and all are among the largest-producing states. If private royalties are expressed as a proportion of total personal income in a state, a slightly different set of states is revealed to be heavily dependent on private oil and gas royalty income: North Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Texas. The leading role of the United States in worldwide oil and gas production and technology development is often attributed to the institution of private ownership that provides companies with willing partners for development of resources (Wang and Krupnick, 2013).

These indicators of enjoyment are part of a user's Quality of Experience (QoE), a measure which further includes additional metrics such as attention levels and ability to succeed. Players stop playing the game when it ceases to provide a high enough QoE, especially in cooperative and social games. [8, 18, 19]. Industry application development and current research both operate with the assumption that for any given individual in a group, that individual's QoE is affected only by their own network condition and not the network conditions of the other group members [4, 7, 8]. We show that this assumption is incorrect. Our research shows that the QoE of all group members is negatively affected by a single member's lag (communication delay, or loss caused by poor network conditions). Understanding a user's QoE as a function that includes other users' network conditions has the potential to improve lag mitigation strategies for multiplayer games and other group applications.

Often the network that separates user end-hosts from server back-end is to blame. To limit the impact of poor network performance on message delay, or lag, back-end logic and application data are deployed across geographically distributed servers and user requests are directed to the closest one [14]. Such nearby servers deliver content more quickly thanks to a faster expansion of TCP congestion window and more rapid retransmissions over low round-trip time (RTT) paths. Our early results, presented in this poster, show a high level of discrepancy between the available tools and motivate further measurement as well as the need to develop techniques for more accurate server replica selection.

OCD uses a dual decomposition of the global problem into local optimization problems in each nodeâs neighborhood. The local solutions are then reconciled to find the global optimal solution. While OCD is a descent method and thus may converge slowly in a static network, we show that OCD can more rapidly adapt to changing network conditions than previously proposed first-order and Newton-like network optimization algorithms. Therefore, OCD yields better solutions over time than previously proposed methods at a comparable communication cost.	['science', 'computer science']

An integral part of their success is the immense size of their global user base. To provide a consistent service to all users, Facebook, the worldâs largest OSN, is heavily dependent on centralized U.S. data centers, which renders service outside of the U.S. sluggish and wasteful of Internet bandwidth. In this paper, we investigate the detailed causes of these two problems and identify mitigation opportunities. Because details of Facebookâs service remain proprietary, we treat the OSN as a black box and reverse engineer its operation from publicly available traces. We find that contrary to current wisdom, OSN state is amenable to partitioning and that its fine grained distribution and processing can significantly improve performance without loss in service consistency. Through simulations of reconstructed Facebook traffic over measured Internet paths, we show that user requests can be processed 79% faster and use 91% less bandwidth. We conclude that the partitioning of OSN state is an attractive scaling strategy for Facebook and other OSN services.	['science', 'computer science']

The vision behind ParaNets is to have challenged network protocols operate over multiple heterogenous networks, simultaneously available, through one or more devices. We present the ParaNets architecture and discuss its short-term challenges and long-term implications.

Dry weather and other droughty conditions have been hard on the non-bloat causing perennial legumes.

Due to the unusually dry weather the past couple of years, hopefully it remains classified as âunusually dryâ rather than the beginning of a new norm, it is best not to make any conjectures about relative yield levels of the various varieties.

The performance of current DTN routing protocols is often limited by routing metric ââstalenessâ, i.e., routing information that becomes out-of-date or inaccurate because of long propagation delays. Our previous work, ParaNets, proposed a new opportunistic network architecture in which the data channel is augmented by a thin end-to-end control channel. The control channel is adequate for the exchange of control traffic, but not data. In this paper we present Cloud Routing, a routing solution for the ParaNets architecture. We motivate the need for such a solution, not only because of stale routing metrics, but also because of congestion that can occur in DTNs. Unable to use up-to-date routing metrics to limit congestion, existing DTN routing solutions suffer from low goodput and long data delivery delays. We show how Cloud Routing avoids congestion by smart use of forwarding opportunities based on up-to-date routing metrics. We evaluate our solution using extensive OPNET simulations. Cloud Routing extends network performance past what is currently possible and motivates a new class of globally cognizant DTN routing solutions.	['science', 'computer science']

Reeder was one of the top yielding varieties averaging 28.6 bu/a across the five locations, however differences in yield among the varieties were significant only in the Winifred and Moccasin recrop nurseries. Low precipitation levels resulted in lower than average yields at all locations tested. This was most evident at the Fort Benton site where yields were approximately one third that of the long term averages. Yields at the Winifred site were also significantly less than long term averages for that area.	['life sciences', 'handicraft', 'science', 'agriculture', 'occupations', 'agronomy', 'industrial arts']

Like most crops, soil fertility, variety selection and other cultural practices impact spring cereal forage yield and quality. Cereal forages are frequently utilized for two to three growing seasons to provide diversity in an alfalfa production system. Harvesting cereals as forages provides the opportunity to remove weeds prior to seed set without the use of herbicides. The firm soil and short stubble left after cereal forage harvest often provides an ideal seed bed for late summer and fall seeding of perennial forage species. Early seeding of spring cereal forages, particularly barley, is encouraged to maximize plant growth during cooler spring temperatures. Spring germinating weeds are less of a concern in cereal forages compared to cereals for grain because the crop is typically harvested prior to weed seed maturation. Plus, the weedy plants can contribute to the forage yield. However, dense weed populations can reduce robust growth and rooting depth resulting in reduced yields. Also, some weed species, such as kochia, may accumulate nitrates at levels higher than the cereal forage. Haybet, Hays and Stockford are three currently popular hooded barley varieties. Tables 4, 5 and 6 provide data showing the relative production of these varieties across several environments. Note the inconsistency of the yield rankings of these varieties.

Yields ranged from 47.3 to 59.7 bu/a at Moccasin and from 16.1 to 21.9 bu/a at Fort Benton. Yields at Fort Benton were well below average due to low rainfall. Dry spring conditions contributed to uneven germination at the Denton site and the nursery was abandoned. The yield of Xena was high at both locations harvested although differences in yield between varieties were not significant at either site. Stressful growing conditions contributed to the increased variability. The trial at Moccasin was planted re-crop after canola and the trial at Fort Benton followed winter wheat. Barley yields ranged from average to well below average depending on the location and the amount of rainfall received. Post harvest seed dormancy evaluations were conducted on barley seed harvested from the trials as a means of predicting weed potential from volunteer barley in cropping systems. Cultivars having the longest germination times are hypothesized to be problematic as this seed would remain dormant through the winter and germinate in early spring to present a weed problem. In September, seed from seven varieties and three locations was placed on wet blotter paper and incubated at 50Â° F. At three, four, five, and seven days, the percentage of germinated seed was recorded. Differences in germination between the three sites were generally insignificant.

Drought-like conditions persisted into the 2001 cropping year across much of Montana. Below normal growing season precipitation was recorded at all sites, with Sidney being the exception. However, Sidney had below normal moisture conditions at seeding and received much above normal precipitation in June. The Conrad-dryland site received only 2.28 inches of crop-year precipitation (April 26th - July 25th), of which 1.53 inches fell in June. The irrigated site at Conrad was abandoned due to a severe kochia (K. scoparia) weed infestation and deer pressures. Statewide dryland dry pea grain yields from 1999 through 2001 have averaged 1,457 pounds per acre (24.3 bu/acre), with Sidney-dryland (1,791 lbs/acre) having the highest four-year average dryland yield (Table 8). Statewide, Carrera yellow pea, with an average dry pea production of 1,919 pounds per acre, along with Eclipse and Victoria yellow peas (equal to Carrera at 5% level), has been the best dry pea grain producer under dryland environments (Table 9). Espace green pea (1,904 lbs/acre) has been the top producing green pea variety (not significant at 5% level). In two years of irrigated trials at Conrad, Swing yellow pea had the best performance, however was only significantly better than Carrera yellow, Melrose Austrian winter and Trapper small yellow peas.

Drought-like conditions persisted into the 2001 cropping year across much of Montana. Below normal growing season precipitation was recorded at all sites, with Sidney being the exception. The above normal precipitation that fell during June, followed by warm humid conditions, at the Sidney site accelerated an outbreak of Ascochyta blight causing severe damage to the chickpea trial. Low grain yields were reported at the Conrad site which received only 2.28 inches of precipitation between seeding date and end of July. By summarizing four years (1998-2001) of performance trials, statewide, Dwelley (kabuli-type) chickpea was out yielded by all other varieties of chickpeas evaluated, except for the one-year trial at Bozeman (Table 23).

In this thesis we discuss how LTE and non-LTE conditions affect the polarized spectral signatures of very small solar magnetic structures. Emergent spectra produced by atmospheres in LTE conditions are dominated by the integral along the entire line of sight, while under non-LTE conditions they originate from volumes on scales of the mean free photon path or longer. On scales approaching the mean free path, we expect non-LTE effects to result in a 'smearing' of the spectroscopic data. We examined magnetic and atmospheric features from numerical sunspot models created by Rempel (2012), which simulate the photosphere with spatial resolutions down to 12 km horizontally and 8 km vertically (Rempel et al., 2009a,b). Using a multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer code and a multi-level iron atom, we generated polarization profiles of small magnetic structures in both 2- and 3D. The common diagnostic Fe I line pair at 630 nm allowed us to investigate the implications for our ability to accurately measure small-scale kilogauss magnetic elements. We searched a Hinode/SOT 2006 observation of a sunspot for matches to the simulated polarimetric data and examined the results of the MERLIN Milne-Eddington inversion code in light of our findings.

The baffles in the steeppass fishway tend to reduce water velocity to magnitudes negotiable by many species. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed for common combinations of fishway slope and head pond elevation. Three-dimensional hydraulics information from the CFD model was used as a basis to predict passage success for American shad in the steeppass. The passage model considered six unique algorithms for swim path during ascent, and both the optimal swim speed approach of Castro-Santos (2005) and newly developed swim-speed information based on the laboratory study of Haro, Odeh, Castro-Santos, and Noreika (1999). The passage model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo framework to facilitate robust comparisons between the passage success predicted by the model and the experimental observations of Haro, Odeh, Castro-Santos, and Noreika (1999). The methods of Webb (1975) and Belke (1991) were then adapted to develop predictions of the energy expenditure of American shad. Findings included the observation that fish in the laboratory study did not tend to utilize the distance-optimizing prolonged swim speed of Castro-Santos (2005), but instead travelled at a faster velocity (more similar to the distance-optimizing burst speed) that resulted in significantly lower energy expenditures. The passage model did not indicate that the steeppass fishway presented a substantial velocity challenge to American shad. Comparisons of the passage model results with passage success in the study by Haro, Odeh, Castro-Santos, and Noreika (1999) led to the observation that other hydraulic factors (such as turbulence) or volitional issues should be the subject of further studies. The passage model was reformulated, creating a conceptual fishway of infinite length, to examine the distance at which model fish fail due to fatigue. The infinite-length model predicted that a fishway of 25 feet in length passed 99.0% of fish without fatigue failure. The velocity distributions from the CFD models also suggested that the zones of low velocity that existed near the bottom of the fishway under high head conditions may be desirable for successful ascent.

Drought-like conditions persisted into the 2001 cropping year across much of Montana. Below normal growing season precipitation was recorded at all sites, with the Sidney site being the exception. The Sidney site had below normal moisture conditions at seeding and received much above normal precipitation in June. The Conrad site received only 2.28 inches of precipitation during the growing season (April 26th - July 25th), of which 1.53 inches fell in June. Looking at multi-year variety yields compared to Laird green lentil at all locations, indicated that most varieties perform equal to or better than Laird, except for at the Huntley site, where Laird tended to do better than the majority of the other lentils evaluated (Table 16). By comparing yields from the 2001 field season to the statewide four-year (1998-2001) average (Tables 12 and 16, respectively), lentil production, under dryland environments, in 2001 was 91% of the four-year statewide trial average (923 lbs/acre and 1,019 lbs/acre, respectively). With an average dryland grain production of 1,159 pounds per acre, CDC Richlea green lentil has been the highest statewide grain yielding lentil over four years of testing. Moccasin lentil yields were the only dryland site where 2001 lentil production was greater than that sites four-year average (1,137 and 1,114 lbs/acre, respectively). Lentil yields in the 2001 season at Corvallis were 166% of that sites two-year average (2,255 and 1,361 lbs/acre, respectively) and over 700 pounds more production than the four site-year irrigated average of 1,512 pounds per acre. Over the four years of statewide lentil evaluations, the dryland grain yields averaged 1,019 pounds per acre, with Sidney, Bozeman and Moccasin having the highest average yields. Under irrigation, lentil production averaged 1,512 pounds per acre in from 1998 through 2001.	['life sciences', 'handicraft', 'science', 'agriculture', 'occupations', 'agronomy', 'industrial arts']
69906	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3291	2001 Canola Variety and Hybrid Performance Evaluations	This report evaluates the relative yield performance of spring canola varieties adapted to the northern plains and intermountain regions. Emergence was slow and very erratic due to dry weather conditions that persisted till early June at both locations. The Moore site was very slow to emerge with much of the emergence occurring in early June. Tyler seeded with a hoe drill and more uniform and much earlier emergence. The delayed emergence contributed to low yield levels at both locations. Extremely high levels of evaporative demand in July were also detrimental to the canola trial yields (See Tables sc35 and sc36). The Moccasin trials were further impacted by ground sparrows and Cashin finch feeding on the seed pods prior and during ripening. Intermountain 223 RR and 357 RR lines were top performers in both trials. These lines have been good performers other years as well. Late seeding and unusually dry weather with high evaporative demand resulted below average canola yields. The variation within the study due to factors other than the characteristics of the varieties themselves reduced the value of both variety evaluation nurseries.

Dry matter forage production averaged 3,086 pounds of dry matter per acre (Table 33). The pure barley treatment (#7) had the most dry matter forage production, with 3,915 pounds per acre (1.95 tons/acre), but was equal to (5% level) the Pea-Barley mixed treatments Nos. 4, 5 and 6. Dry pea stands were very similar to target rates, barley stands, however, were significantly less than their target rates. No differences in maturity or canopy heights were observed within the study. Based on the actual stand densities the data set was subdivided into three barley densities: 3, 6 and 9 plants per square foot and a supplemental analysis was performed to show the affect of barley density on pea forage production (Table 33B). Dry pea plant stand densities were not significantly different within the subset, while forage production potential was significantly impacted by increased barley density. At a plant density ratio of 2:3 (6 plants pea to 9 plants barley), dry pea production was only 707 pounds per acre, while at the same plant density (6 plants/ft2) the pure dry pea stand yielded 2,171 pounds per acre. Barley plants density and forage production increased at very similar rates. Overall, dry matter forage production was greatest when the barley density was highest, indicating barley plant density controls forage production of pea-barley mixes.

Dry matter forage production over the four seeding configurations averaged 2,376 pounds of dry matter production per acre (Table 31). The pure barley configuration under 120 pounds N per acre had the most dry matter forage production, with 3,437 pounds per acre (1.7 tons/acre), but was equal to (5% level) pea â barley mixed and pure barley plots, under 60 pounds of N per acre. The pure barley plot under 120 lbs N, also had the greatest protein yield (455 lbs) and canopy height (25â). When plots were compared to Pea-Barley mixed plots over all three N-fertilizer rates, the pure pea plots were the only treatment affect that was significantly different than the pea-barley mixed plot in forage production and protein content (Table 32). There appeared to be no significant differences when Nitrogen fertilizer rates were varied. A more thorough analysis will be written at a later date.

Same as the variety evaluation trial, Lupin-M1 kept green throughout the summer, we did not harvest this variety. Furthermore, there was herbicide damage caused by the residual herbicide from previous crop (it was suspected to be Tordon). The damage was especially severe in Replicate 1, therefore, only the replicate 2 and 3 were harvested. Data from two varieties and two replicates are presented as following. Yields were generally lower than the variety evaluation trial. There was no significant different between the drill types and varieties (Fig. 1). Seeding date and rate significantly affected lupine seed yield (Fig.2). The second seeding date (1 May) had higher yield than the first (11 April) and the third (29 May) seeding dates. Yield increased significantly when seeding rate increased from 100 la/A to 120 lb/A, but there was no difference when seeding rate increased from 80 and 100 and when seeding rate increased from 120 to 160 lb/a(Fig.2).

Drought-like conditions persisted into the 2002 cropping year across much of Montana. At the Moccasin site, crop-year precipitation (April through July) was 86% of normal, receiving 1.14 inches below the normal growing season precipitation. Dry pea grain yields for selected varieties that have been included in the Statewide Dry Pea Performance Trial at Moccasin for three (3) or more of the five years (1998 - 2002) the trials have been conducted, were summarized (Table 5). Dry pea grain production of these selected varieties has averaged 1,666 pounds per acre (27.8 bu/acre) and has increased since 1998. With an average dry pea production of 1,967 pounds per acre, Grande, smooth yellow pea, has been the best grain producer, but has not had significantly (p â¤ 0.05) higher production than CDC Handel, CDC Mozart and Swing smooth yellow peas. Compared with Trapper yellow field pea (a forage type), all varieties tested, with the exception of the Austrian winter pea Granger, have consistently out-yielded Trapper.

Droughty conditions of late 2007 persisted through early May and commenced again in mid-June following above average precipitation in May. Early spring weather consisted of frequent dry windy days with almost daily freezing and thawing of the surface soil through March and early April. The frequent freezing and thawing coupled with low relative humidity broke down the surface soil structure leaving it quite powdery. All five crops, camelina, canola yellow mustard, flax and safflower, had their highest 2008 yield from the April 17th seed date (Table 1). The germination and emergence of seedlings from the April 17th seed date occurred after area temperatures dropped below zero and wind driven snirt (snow & dirt) grated on emerged plant tissue. Earlier emerging seedlings experienced more weather related stress and some mortality. In general, Moccasin yields of cool season oilseeds, camelina, canola and yellow mustard are reduced when seeding is delayed till mid April (Table 2 & Fig. 1). The need to get cool season oilseed crops seeded in early spring may not be as critical in areas with similar growing season temperatures and deeper soils (greater plant available water) or more July precipitation.

Much of the current research has investigated the general use mobile devices such as smartphones rather than identifying the specific applications used by university students to support their learning. In addition, there is a lack of research investigating the influence of institution, gender and culture on university students' use of smartphones to supporting their learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate how US university students and university students from Saudi Arabia use smartphone for learning in the undergraduate teacher education courses. A total of 249 undergraduate teacher education students from Montana State University and 320 undergraduate students from King Kahlid University, Saudi Arabia were surveyed to assess their use of smartphone applications to support their learning. Results from the 43 item smartphone survey found that MSU students reported using their smartphones ""sometime to often"" during class and outside of classroom setting while KKU students on the other hand reported using smartphones ""Never or Rarely"" during class or outside of class. The most frequent use of smartphones by MSU students reported was for communicating and collaborating with others by texting or through email. The most frequent uses of smartphones reported by KKU students during and outside of class were for ""communicating with others by texting and ""accessing course information"". Although MSU and KKU students differed significantly on some of the items assessing smartphone use in and outside of the classroom, the differences were very small in magnitude. Both MSU and KKU students reported that they ""never or rarely"" observed others using their smartphones to dishonestly to complete assignments or during quizzes and exams. Results from this study indicate that smartphone applications are under utilized as a learning tool in higher education. As university students continue to have greater access to mobile devices, university faculty should consider ways to develop courses that are accessible by smartphones and other mobile devices to increase student learning opportunities."

Within hydrology, uncertainty analysis is commonly conducted using Bayesian inference or Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE). Bayesian inference is a statistically rigorous method for estimating uncertainty, but it depends upon a formal likelihood function that may not be available. GLUE utilizes a generalized likelihood function that can operate as a proxy for a formal likelihood function. While this allows GLUE to effectively calibrate hydrological models with intractable likelihood functions, the lack of statistical rigor may negatively affect the uncertainty estimations. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a family of likelihood-free methods that have been recently introduced for calibrating hydrological models. While these methods are implemented using formal Bayesian inference for assessing uncertainty, they do not require any assumptions regarding the likelihood function. Thus they have the potential flexibility of GLUE with the statistical rigor inherent in Bayesian Inference. The studies presented within this thesis demonstrate the theoretical links between GLUE and ABC. We then assess the efficacy of an implementation of ABC utilizing a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler (ABC-SMC) for calibrating Conceptual Rainfall-Runoff models. Two components of the ABC-SMC algorithm were evaluated. These included three classes of summary statistics used for evaluating model performance and post-processing techniques to adjust the final posterior distributions of the parameters. ABC-SMC was computationally efficient in calibrating a six parameter hydrological model for one synthetic and two real world data sets. Post-processing using local linear regression generated marginal improvements to the posterior distributions. Summary statistics measuring the goodness-of-fit between the observed and predicted hydrographs performed well for the synthetic data where the total uncertainty was low. A composite summary statistic based upon matching both hydrograph and hydrological signatures of a basin were more effective for the real world data sets as total uncertainty increased. The results suggest a properly implemented ABC-SMC algorithm is an effective method for calibrating watershed models and for conducting uncertainty analysis.

MS is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. The impact and damage is highly variable from one person to the next. Women are affected more often than men. Exercise is a pattern of physical activity and movement. Resilience is the ability to cope with change or misfortune, a fluid quality that acts to modify individual responses to risk. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between exercise and resilience in people with MS. A correlational study was used to determine if a relationship exists between exercise and resilience in a convenience sample, consisting of 74 MS patients at a neuroscience center. The hypothesis that there was a positive relationship between exercise and resilience in persons with MS was not borne out in this population. r= 0.094 indicating that there was no relationship between exercise and resilience in persons with MS. Characteristics that may have contributed to the lower GLTEQ scores and the higher RS scores include that the sample was older, substantially unemployed, had suffered the impact of the disease for many years, and may have been living at a lower income level from those who more recently were diagnosed with MS. The convenience sample was somewhat homogeneous, and was missing younger persons who were in earlier stage of the disease. Recommended areas for future study and emphasis include; Targeting prevention from initial diagnosis instead of waiting until an MS patient has already suffered many negative outcomes. Studying a more active, fit subpopulation of MS patients may indicate a positive correlation between resilience and fitness, and therefore underscore the need for more structured, rigorous, aerobic exercise programs that would maintain and lead to fitness for those with MS.

The performance of the null steering algorithms is validated through extensive simulation and hardware implementation. The results of the techniques of null steering, including controlling the complex weights, usually have to rely on simulations to study system performances, design trade-offs, and system optimization, which by itself can be quite complex and a time-consuming task. Even after extensive simulations, it is not easy to get insights as to what parameters determine system performance in different system parameters, and the interactions on system parameters. Therefore, experimentation and deployment on a real system is required. Few studies have proposed null steering algorithms studies using real implementations. With this motivation, this work presents comprehensive performance comparison of some of the available null steering techniques using an analog array. The contributions of this thesis are: optimize the performance of null steering algorithms taking into account realistic considerations in the simulations and demonstrating the benefits through extensive simulations; and verify the performance of the null steering system through experimental implementation using a simple, compact, lightweight, low cost, high gain, high throughput analog antenna array.

Activities such as hiking that are conducted under a fixed energy input or rations and can result in an energy deficit in the body. Continued energy deficit can result in a myriad of medical problems such as injury, muscle cramping, depression, dehydration, and reduced coordination, which can lead to collapse, hypoglycemia, energy electrolyte imbalance and depressed immune function. The purpose of this study is to define the energy expenditure balance among a sample of participants engaging in strenuous outdoor activities. Anthropomorphic, resting metabolic rate and body mass index measurements were taken pre and post course. Course diet logs were taken as well as trip route logs, which included kilometers traveled as well as meters climbed in elevation. Energy expenditure was calculated using distance traveled and climbed and resting metabolic rate. Energy intake was calculated from diet logs. Results suggest that subjects in the study operated in an overall energy surplus but significant differences over the 7-days course were found when comparing energy balance day by day. A repeated measure ANOVA (actual and results) showed significant differences in energy balance over the course of the seven days. Post-hoc analysis suggested energy balance deficits differed significantly between day one and day two, day one and day four, day two and day six, day three and day four, day three and day six, and day four and day six. Many variables could have contributed to deficits on these days such as human factors, stress, event timing and increased energy expenditure. Understanding the pattern of energy deficits may help prepare those planning to engage in strenuous outdoor activities as well as inform organization that lead such activities.	['energy consumption']

This thesis has been separated into three parts. The first part is an annotated bibliography of all of the sources that I used in the catalog and the essay. They give a summary of what the source contains whether it be a website, journal or book. The second part is the catalog that discusses eleven works of art and their relation to Henry VIII and the English armory at Greenwich. The armor is listed in chronological order from 1500 to 1540 before the armory was founded to the late reign of Henry VIII. Throughout the twenty-eight year reign of Henry VIII English armor design became its own identity, which had originated across the Channel in Southern Germany and Northern Italy. The third part of the thesis is the argument regarding a history painting of Henry's invasion of Northern France in 1513 titled the Battle of the Spurs ca. 1513. Incorporating the catalog and the annotated bibliography, the argument discusses the possible origins of who painted it and what armor the figures are wearing including Henry VIII. It is painting of a historical event, but we need to approach the painting as a mere representation on paint and not fact. That goes the same for the armor. The catalog is meant to help us differentiate German armor from English armor and to give the reader a foundation of what English armor is. The argument also looks to other paintings and prints from Italy, Spain, and Germany to compare the armor and the structure of the landscape, placement of figures and iconography.

Within the Big Snowy Arch, central Montana, reservoir units that are targets for carbon sequestration have experienced Laramide and younger deformation and widespread Eocene igneous activity, which introduced a heating mechanism for hydrothermal fluid flow and created anisotropy in Mississippian strata. One particular region of interest is the western flank of the Big Snowy Mountains, which contains a northeast-southwest striking, high-angle fault zone which has acted as a conduit for hydrothermal brine solutions into the overlying Phanerozoic rocks. Such fault zones often branch and bifurcate as they propagate up-section through the overburden, until a loss of thermally-driven hydrodynamic pressure terminates the upward movement of carbon dioxide-rich brines, leaving a distinct assemblage of collapse breccia rich in hydrothermal minerals, such as saddle dolomite and sulfide precipitates. To determine the degree of structurally-induced anisotropy within the reservoir units, field techniques (detailed structural measurements and lithologic descriptions) coupled with analytical methods (X-ray diffraction spectrometry, stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses, secondary electron imagery, and petrography) were utilized. These techniques presented concrete evidence of hydrothermal mineralization and episodic fluid flow within the brecciated region of the fault zone. These areas are major avenues of enhanced porosity and permeability in the subsurface, which has important applications at some sites in Montana where carbon sequestration is under consideration (e.g., Kevin Dome).

A mixed-method approach was used. Surveys were distributed to educators within the sampling frame; focus group interviews were conducted with volunteer educators and chosen secondary and postsecondary students. Descriptive statistics were conducted and themes were identified among the interview data. Independent t-tests were conducted to determine if the difference in high school English teachers' and college educators' perceptions were significant. The study revealed that all participants believed editing and proofreading, avoiding plagiarism, maintaining focus, providing organization with logical grouping, and using discernable introductions and conclusions were important in writing. Differences included high school English teachers perceived employing a writing process, providing students with examples of effective writing, representing different points of view, and using appropriate vocabulary as essential writing requirements and expectations. College writing instructors' foci were on presenting a thesis and supporting these claims with multiple and appropriate sources of evidence while also evaluating these source materials critically, and providing written feedback to students.

Nurses who are hired to a behavioral health facility often have no previous experience in psychiatry or with medications used to treat psychiatric patients. These medications carry specific risks and adverse effects that can lead to serious, life threatening complications if patients are not monitored or properly educated about potential side effects. Education on medications for nurses during orientation can easily be overlooked. The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a comprehensive training program about psychiatric medications to deliver to newly hired nurses in a child and adolescent behavioral health facility. The project was created from evidenced-based neuroscience research on psychiatric medications, adverse medication syndromes, and movement disorders associated with the use of psychotropic medications. The ninety minute training module included a posttest and an evaluation form. After implementing the program, the nurses expressed an enhanced knowledge base of medications used in psychiatry, an increased awareness of how to monitor for medication side effects or adverse events, and more confidence with teaching patients about their medications. The effectiveness of the program strongly suggested a permanent place for this training during orientation in a behavioral health facility, and one that would include the role of a psychiatric nurse practitioner as an educator and mentor to the behavioral health nurses.

Changes in agricultural management practices have shown the ability to sequester carbon by increasing soil organic carbon and include reduced tillage intensity, decreased fallow, and changing from monoculture to rotational cropping. All have become more common in portions of the Northern Great Plains; but, despite the growth of these practices, it is unknown to what extent farmers have adopted particular cropping sequences or how they have spread temporally or spatially. My purpose here was to investigate the patterns of changing agricultural practices in northeast Montana during 2001-2012 by focusing on the increased adoption of cereal-pulse sequences and the adoption of block-managed cereal-based sequences in lieu of continuous strip-cropping. A method to identify crops via geospatial data and Landsat imagery was developed, and annual crop maps were created. Crop classifications were extracted from the maps for each field to create a 12-character string for the temporal sequence of crops, and specific 2- and 3-yr sequences were identified with a string-matching algorithm. Finally, I examined the observed spatial patterns of sequence adoption to determine if observed spatial patterns were random or were they consistent with the spread and adoption due to social interaction as described in innovation diffusion theory, adoption based on environmental factors, or neither. The major findings were: (1) cereal-fallow rotations, whether managed in blocks or by strip-cropping, no longer dominate the region; (2) there has been a substantial increase in the adoption of cereal-pulse sequences; (3) producers did not adhere strongly to specific sequences; (4) using 3-yr sequences added no additional information than 2-yr sequences; (5) the adoption of these practices was not randomly located but clustered; and (6) the adoption of these practice are not well-explained by innovation diffusion theory, although social interactions might have played a role in the early stages; the patterns are more consistent with suitability of the physical environment since available water was strongly associated with whether or not a field was managed with either practice.

As a metalloid it is often found in the environment with Arsenic (As). Extended exposure in humans causes heart disease, lung disease, diarrhea, severe vomiting and ulcers. In plants, it inhibits early crop growth. A large body of data on bacterial response and mechanisms for detoxification also exists. In contrast, knowledge about how archaeal species respond to Sb is much less extensive. The model crenarchaeal organism Sulfolobus solfataricus, can survive in environments with high antimony concentrations, and the genetic and biochemical mechanisms responsible for antimony tolerance have yet to be reported. As a first step in bringing to light the biological response of S. solfataricus to antimony, a set of proteomic and chemical tagging experiments were undertaken. Two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) showed a limited response from intracellular and membrane proteins with respect to their abundance. In contrast, chemical targeting of cysteine residues revealed that extensive oxidation had occurred to both cytosolic and membrane proteins upon exposure to antimony. To remove any possible experimental artifacts that could alter the oxidation state of protein thiols, a method for labeling cytoplasmic proteins in live S. solfataricus cells was developed. This method used the recently described Z-dye probes for quantitative comparisons. Together, our results suggest that Sb response is primarily focused on a general stress factors likely stemming from oxidative damage to proteins. No evidence for a specific transport or bioconversion was present. Cysteine residues in membrane proteins displayed the most significant oxidative changes. The demonstration that chemical biology approaches can be applied to prokaryotic cells, even those growing at extremes of temperature and Ph, should have broad appeal for microbiologists well beyond those investigating archaea.

In order to help fill this gap in current research, seven pre-service teachers contributed interview data by answering eleven open-ended questions about which compositional skill and task proficiencies they considered most crucial during their preparation for an in-service career. This data was then compared to other current studies exploring writing skill and task competencies for pre-service and in-service teachers. Because this information was so scarce, data was also included from college-prep, college-remedial, and general college-level writing research as well as from study results from four university career preparation programs: psychology, business, history, and fundamental and applied sciences. Convergent and divergent themes were generated and analyzed. During the course of the interviews, pre-service teachers identified writing skill proficiencies that comprised mechanical, organizational, social, and cognitive aspects. Task competencies included professional, communicative, instructional, and personal compositional types. Compared to research literature, pre-service teachers exhibited a heightened concern with mechanical skills while underemphasizing cognitive writing proficiencies. This was also reflected in their task emphases; concern for correct mechanics when writing for colleagues, sending letters to parents, and modeling for students were frequently mentioned themes. Personal task proficiencies were also more highly regarded in some research literature than by the seven interviewees. Additionally, pre-service teachers agreed strongly with current studies suggesting that a single freshman writing course was insufficient writing preparation for career-oriented training in composition. Conclusions reached by this study emphasized meeting currently expressed pre-service teacher needs for mechanical instruction while also nurturing awareness of cognitive writing competencies. Support for social and organizational proficiencies should also continue throughout teacher training. It was suggested that desired skill proficiencies could best be developed by practicing authentic, career-specific writing tasks accompanied by instruction and positive, yet clear, feedback. Both skill and task competency development should be supported consistently over the entire course of the teacher training program, according to the interviewees and current research data.

However, many with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Montana may lack access to social support and illness-related knowledge needed to manage their disease successfully. If a viable, accessible, and beneficial opportunity were available, it would be crucial to have the endorsement of local physicians. The problem addressed in this study was that those serving individuals in Montana with IBD need to know how individuals participating in a Montana-specific, online support community for those in Montana with IBD assess and describe their experiences within the community, and how they report that their experiences have affected their HRQOL in the areas of social support and illness knowledge. Three research questions were posed: How do participants assess and describe their experiences within the online community; how have their experiences impacted their HRQOL as exhibited through impacts on social support; and, how have their experiences impacted their HRQOL as exhibited through impacts on illness knowledge? Ten participants were recruited from the membership of the online community, MontanasGotGuts.org. A 20-item, self-report survey instrument was initially used to obtain demographic data, website usage data, and data on participants' experiences. Next, qualitative research methods, using semi-structured interviews, were conducted to collect more insightful, descriptive data. Study findings consisted of four major themes with 14 subthemes that illustrated how the participants experienced the online community. The major themes included: participants expressed a need to meet others with IBD; participants reported low active participation levels; participants valued the community as a source of IBD-related information; and, participants valued the community as a source of social support. Recommendations were made to the researcher, the national IBD community, those with IBD and their physicians, and other online health community administrators.

It is unclear how prepared elementary educators are for the framework. This study sought to establish measures for assessing inservice educators' self-reported understanding of the new framework and readiness to implement the ideas in their science instruction. Designing and validating an instrument to assess these constructs followed procedures established in the literature. First, literature on science education was examined to identify themes that could be used in constructing instrument items. This item pool was examined and modified through expert review. Next, the modified instrument was piloted with a small sample, N = 13, of inservice educators. After final adjustments to the instrument, it was used in a large scale validation study. Inservice elementary educators from four states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah participated in the validation study, N= 167. Since understanding and readiness were determined to assess separate constructs, the two were handled individually during statistical analyses. Exploratory analysis on both scales, understanding and readiness, revealed stable factor models that were further validated through confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency reliability of the scales were determined through Cronbach's Alpha. With solid statistical evidence, conclusions were drawn from the study. Each instrument could be used in similar contexts to measure elementary educators' understanding of or readiness to implement the new framework for science education. The unique factor structures of the two scales suggests important differences between understanding and readiness. These differences should inform professional development efforts.

In this thesis both theoretical and empirical approaches were used to investigate the effects of environmental variation on niche structure. A mathematical model was developed to make predictions about the consequences of temporal frequency regime on optimal behavior. Three different time scales of environmental variation were studied: faster than the growth rate, slower than growth rate, and similar to growth rate. The model results predicted that (i) optimal behavior appears to be independent of fast environmental variation, (ii) niche width is largely determined by slow environmental variation, and (iii) biological clocks may have evolved from environmental variations that occur with a frequency that is comparable to the growth rate of the organism. Representatives of the predominant organisms inhabiting the microbial mats found in the effluent channels of Mushroom Spring, Yellowstone National Park, were cultivated, and the growth rates of the isolated strains were measured with respect to light, temperature, and availability of dissolved inorganic carbon. The growth rate measurements suggested that closely-related Synechococcus species with distinct ecological adaptations exist within the Mushroom Spring community, and may explain the genetic diversity found in situ. The results also suggested that the fundamental light niche is interconnected with other environmental parameters, such as temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon availability. To compare the results of the mathematical and microbiological approaches, environmental light data that were collected in the vicinity of Mushroom Spring were incorporated into the mathematical model. The optimal fundamental light niche that was predicted by the model and the measured light niche of one of the cultivated strains exhibited qualitative similarities. Collectively, this interdisciplinary approach has led to the identification of several environmental characteristics that are hypothesized to be important in determining niche structure.

In 2010 (O'Lynn), a literature review to determine the level of support for the SATL process resulted in a more circular model called the Symptom Action Process (SAP). An integrative literature review in 2012 was conducted to determine the level of support for the SATL and SAP models, resulting in a revision, named the Health Needs Action Process (HNAP) (Rasmussen, Winters, & O'Lynn, 2013). The HNAP differed from the SATL and SAP in that the term 'symptom' was replaced with 'health need' to reflect a broader spectrum of health demands including psychological needs. All three models, SATL, SAP, and HNAP, were based on studies in the United States (U.S.). The HNAP included studies with women-only and mixed gender samples. The lack of international and male-only samples in the previous work prompted this integrative literature review to determine support for the HNAP model. Key words from the models (rural, rural health, self-care, health needs, health/illness behavior, attitudes/beliefs about self-care, decision-making, self-assessment, alternative therapies, complimentary medicine, and home remedies) were used to search the literature published from 2004-2013 using CINAHL, MedLine, and Psych Info. International studies and those involving men only were included in the new search. Case studies, dissertations, and anecdotal reports were excluded from the integrative review. Inductive and deductive coding was used to identify existing and new concepts/themes. The sample consisted of 17 studies: 29% were from the U.S. (17 states); 71% were conducted outside the U.S. (10 countries). Study samples included 23.5% women, 11.5% men, 65% mixed gender; 29% elderly, 71% adult, 0% children/youth; 71% rural; and 29% compared rural with urban samples. This integrative review provides support for the HNAP model regarding the use of self-care, lay resources, and professional resources when responding to both physical and psychological health needs. Health care providers can use this knowledge to assist rural persons to successfully manage health needs both domestically and internationally.

Derided by some and praised by others, the genre takes many forms and continues to evolve. Since its modern inception, a debate has raged over the effects of reality TV on society. I continue this dialogue by exploring the ethics behind reality television production. I take a personal perspective, examining my own attempt to produce reality TV. I created 'The Art of War' as an experiment into ethically conscious reality TV production. 'The Art of War' specifically examines the choices I and other producers face in series design, casting, and pre-production. I investigate how my production differs from others in the industry, specifically Animal Planet's 'Call of the Wildman'. From this comparison, I draw an argument for including a wider variety of voices within the reality TV genre. I make a case for an alternative production format, based on personal responsibility for both reality TV producers and viewers. Reality TV wields cultural power and with that comes responsibility, not just for those viewing it, but also for those creating it.

Simultaneously, pressures continue to mount with regard to the expectation for lower costs with improved quality of care. These problems have drawn the attention of many researchers seeking ways to improve healthcare delivery. These efforts regularly identify two key issues requiring solutions: 1) Improving clinical outcomes by reducing adverse patient conditions due to medical errors, and 2) Improving care delivery by reducing staffing shortages and turnover within the nursing profession. Several studies have shown that workplace culture and incivility can be a material contributor to both of these issues. While many researchers have investigated the nature of nurse-physician interaction, and their effects on clinical and nursing outcomes, they mostly focus on the 'perception' of nurses and not physicians. Perhaps more importantly, these studies generally did not distinguish between descriptive and injunctive norms suggested by Social Norms Theory (SNT). This study seeks to close both of these gaps. This study developed a new survey instrument to measure these norms and performed a sample survey of the physicians and nurses of Montana and Denver area. This study used SNT to identify any gaps between descriptive and injunctive norms of RNs and MDs regarding their relationship culture and their effects behaviors on perceived nursing outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction, retention, etc.) and perceived clinical outcomes (e.g. medical errors, quality of care). The study sought to investigate these gaps because SNT suggests that people tend to behave in the way they believe is most typical of and accepted by their peers (perceived norms). Unfortunately, perceptions of others' behaviors are quite frequently inaccurate, with views of problematic behaviors tending to be overestimated and healthy behaviors tending to be underestimated. SNT offers an innovative approach for addressing such situations by changing perceptions. The findings of the study suggest significant differences between the perceived norms of physicians and nurses when compared to their actual norms. The findings are expected to be helpful for developing an intervention program to improve the relationship culture between physicians and nurses which can contribute to improve quality of patient care and nursing retention.

Casey Foundation. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) was created when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Several counties within Montana adopted the evidence-based Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) home visiting program under the direction of MIECHV. The NFP program delivers care to at-risk pregnant mothers and their children. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a review of the literature to investigate communication approaches that the NFP nurse uses or could use during a home visit with the mother, that strengthens the ability of the nurse to capture and empower the mother's voice as customer. Three databases were utilized with a total of ten search terms. A total of five qualitative articles were found that directly examined the voice of the mother receiving home visiting services. Trust was the key term used to examine components of the dyad relationship. Trust within the provider-patient relationship is important as it is tied directly to program engagement and positive outcomes. After analysis of the articles, six themes surfaced that the mothers expressed and included personality, friendship, availability, empowerment, reducing vulnerability, and testing. Additional sub themes included emotional support, knowing, control, verbal praise, advocacy, and respect. Little research exists that directly examines and seeks to garner the experiences of at-risk mothers participating in home visiting programs. Complicating the literature search was the finding that trust is poorly defined in nursing literature and the health science literature as a whole. Further research and inquiry is needed to understand, according to the patient perspective, how trust is built, maintained, broken, and repaired. Understanding the concept of trust according to the patient perspective is imperative as home visiting programs are implemented within the state of Montana. Capturing the voice of the customer is not only a mandate but is imperative to improve the health status of our State.

Hexavelent uranium is a common environmental contaminant that reacts with water to form the dioxo-uranium cation, UO 2 2+. Environmental uranium contamination is the result of a number of activities including uranium mining, production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes, storage and disposal of nuclear weaponry, and fuel for nuclear power plants. Despite the potential importance of the interaction of UO 2 2+ with biologically relevant molecules, only limited molecular insight is available. In a recent publication, the presence of UO 2 2+ in submicromolar concentrations was shown to affect ethanol metabolism in Pseudomonas spp. by displacing the Ca 2+ of the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor. Accordingly, the interaction of UO 2 2+ with PQQ is used here as a starting point to carry out both an in vitro and in silico analysis of UO 2 2+ and its interactions with biologically relevant cofactors and metabolites. This work represents a proposed molecular mechanism of uranium toxicity in bacteria, and has relevance for uranium toxicity in many living systems. The structural insights from modeling allow us to expand the scope of potential uranium toxicity to other systems by considering the favorable coordination mode to pyridine nitrogen adjacent to carboxylic and/or carbonyl groups. Consequently, the recent discovery of uranium toxicity at submicromolar levels in bacteria provides relevance to serious environmental and public health issues in the light of current EPA regulation of 0.13 micron uranium limit in drinking water.

Little research has looked into the potential benefits that working with horses can bring to normal functioning adolescents. Also, little has been studied about the academic benefits of working with horses. The purpose of this study was to examine the perception of boarding school students who are involved in a horse program and how their involvement impacts their ability to succeed academically. More specifically, the study investigated the perceived relationship of being involved in a riding program and working with horses and students' perceptions of success seen through the lens of self-efficacy, self-regulation, and academic motivation. Further, this study investigates whether previous equine experience has a relationship with boarding school students' perception of their self-efficacy, self-regulation, and academic motivation. The study found a common positive perception where 64 percent of the students viewed being involved in the horse program having a positive influence on their ability to succeed academically. Additionally, this research supports the utilization of a horse program in fostering the development of self-regulation, and promotes the transfer of cognitive skills into the academic domain.

To achieve these goals, high-temperature materials with high-strength, low-cost and non-strategic compositions are needed. In advanced turbine applications, combustor liners, blades and vanes are exposed to corrosive combustion byproducts, such as alkali salts, at temperatures up to ~1700Â°C with high gas velocities, entrained particulates, and other foreign objects at pressures of up to 3 MPa (30 atm). These extreme conditions can drive a dangerous phenomenon known as ""hot corrosion"", an accelerated form of oxidation that occurs when metals and metal alloys are heated in the temperature range 700-900Â°C in the presence of alkali salts. An increased understanding of the fundamental behaviors of common high temperature alloys and their degradation mechanisms is therefore critical for the production of reliable components. In this study a model substrate, Nickel 201, was coated on one side with Cr, Al, or Si thin films (~1 micron) via magnetron sputtering physical vapor deposition (PVD). Uncoated and PVD coated samples were then exposed to laboratory air at 700Â°C and 900Â°C and to an environment similar in composition to atmospheres found in post combustion turbine systems, comprised of air/SO 2 gas mixture, at 700Â°C. The exposures were conducted over time intervals observing coating-substrate interactions and surface oxide development. Identical samples were subjected to the same exposures with addition of a deposit of sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4), a model alkali salt. Sample mass gains were recorded and resulting oxide compositions assessed as a function of exposure time using microscopy techniques on sample surfaces and cross sections. The development of intermetallic species was determined by X-ray diffraction. At 700Â°C, coated and uncoated samples displayed different oxidation behaviors. Under laboratory air, no hot-corrosion occurred. While at 700Â°C in air/SO 2 exposures, evidence for hot corrosion on deposited samples was observed. When sodium sulfate was introduced at 900Â°C, coated and uncoated samples displayed rapid corrosion consistent with hot corrosion. The oxidation processes and coating/substrate inter-diffusion phenomena are presented and discussed in the context of establishing basic approaches to improve the fundamental understanding of hot corrosion, and the protection mechanisms of high temperature materials."

Exercise is a lifestyle factor that decreases risk of these conditions. The type of exercise performed might play a role in the insulin response to exercise as well as a recommended post-exercise meal. Eccentric exercise is shown to increase insulin resistance while concentric is known to decrease insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are differences in post-exercise insulin levels between eccentric and concentric exercise conditions with a post-exercise meal, and the relationship with waist circumference (WC), a measure of central obesity. Participants were women (n =24), stratified into low (LWC) and high (HWC) waist circumference groups. Participants completed three test conditions: a 45-minute walk at -10% grade at 3.0MPH, a 45-minute walk at +10% grade at a speed that maintained 60% of estimated VO 2max, and a control. A mixed meal was consumed thirty minutes after completion of the test. Finger stick measures of glucose were taken at 0, right before consumption, and then 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes following the meal. Insulin, C-peptide, and glucose were measured pre-test and immediately, 8 hours, and 24 hours after completion of the test. Muscle soreness was measured when blood was collected. The HWC group had higher (p< 0.05) insulin across time points compared to the LWC group in the control and uphill conditions. C-peptide was greater (p<0.05) across time points for the HWC group in the control compared to the LWC group. The HWC group had greater (p<0.05) insulin at 60-minutes in response to the meal during the control condition than the LWC group. The LWC had greater (p<0.05) insulin at 60 minutes in the downhill compared to the control. Muscle soreness was increased (p<0.05) the most in response to the downhill condition. We conclude that waist circumference influenced insulin levels following exercise, where uphill walking improved indices of glycemic control for those of greater waist circumference while downhill walking worsened indices of glycemic control for those of a lower waist circumference.

Some previous studies have found large, negative associations between alcohol taxes and fatalities. However, commonly used price data suggest little or no connection between alcohol prices and fatalities. These apparently conflicting findings may result from measurement error and/or endogeneity in the price data, which biases ordinary least squares estimators toward a finding of no price effects. Using alcohol taxes as instrumental variables, fatalities are found to be negatively related to prices. In addition, alcohol consumption is strongly positively related to fatalities. However, biases may still remain, because taxes are not entirely suitable as instruments.	['auxiliary sciences of history', 'civilization', 'economics', 'social sciences']

Are alcohol taxes quickly and fully passed on to consumers? Given the difficulties of accurately measuring beverage prices, are beer taxes a good empirical proxy for the price of alcohol? Using pooled cross sectionâtime series data on state and Federal alcohol taxes and beverage prices, beer taxes are found to be poor predictors of alcohol prices. Controlling for state and period effects, excise taxes appear to be overâshifted: Retail prices rise by more than the amount of the tax, and the rise occurs within 3 months.	['public policy']

The study involved a literature review and a practice survey, which was distributed to all state and selected local agencies in the United States. The literature review revealed the overall lack of knowledge about the operational and safety aspects of channelized right-turn lanes explaining, to a large extent, the lack of guidance in practice. Survey results suggest a heavy reliance on engineering judgment by highway agencies in the use of channelized right-turn lanes and the selection of traffic control. Further, results confirmed a general perception in practice about the safety benefits of signal control at channelized right-turn lanes, despite the fact that such benefits were not supported by studies or statistics. The study emphasized the need for further research on the operational and safety aspects of this right-turn treatment at intersections.

Specifically, the study focused on the effect of horizontal curve radii and sight distance on speed selection. Seven sites were examined in this study that are located along a 10-mile stretch of a rural high crash corridor, US 191 north of Big Sky in southwest Montana. Two of the study sites have no restrictive geometry representing base conditions, another two have restrictive curve radii, and the other three have restrictive radii and sight distances. Vehicle speeds, classification, and headways were collected at each site. The selected speeds for free-moving vehicles were compared to the legal speed limit, advisory speed, and the speeds dictated by curve radius and sight distance when applicable. Study results found that the vast majority of observed selected speeds are notably higher than the speeds found using the alignment and sight distance design equations. Results also showed that the perceived safe speeds selected by drivers are likely to be determined by the most restrictive geometric feature.

When a person is not aware that a duration judgment must be made until later (retrospective paradigm), remembered duration depends on incidental memory for temporal information. In the present article we describe two experiments in which durations involved with high-level, executive-control functions were judged either prospectively or retrospectively. In one experiment, the executive function involved resolving syntactic ambiguity in reading. In another experiment, it involved controlling the switching between tasks. In both experiments, there was a unique cost to the operation of control high-level, executive functions which was manifested by prospective reproductions shortening a finding that supports an attentional model of prospective timing. In addition, activation of executive functions produced contextual changes that were encoded in memory and resulted in longer retrospective reproductions, a finding that supports a contextual-change model of retrospective timing. Thus, different cognitive processes underlie prospective and retrospective timing. Recent findings obtained by some brain researchers also support these conclusions.

The study site was located on US Highway 287 between the town of Townsend and the City of Helena in the state of Montana. Traffic volumes at study site, while considered relatively low, were typical on two-lane highways in many rural states. Per-lane analysis of performance measures and lane utilization (volume split) were used to indirectly examine passing maneuvers and lane changing at successive locations within the passing lane section. For the case study site, it was evident that traffic performance became relatively stable beyond half a mile into the passing lane for the traffic volumes investigated. Therefore, results strongly suggested that most passing maneuvers already took place before the 0.5-mile station and that the actual passing lane length was well beyond the optimal length required for breaking up platoons and improving performance.

The Vibrothermographic method relies on high-amplitude vibrational excitations within a structure to cause frictional rubbing along flaw surfaces. Frictional heat energy dissipated between flaw surfaces diffuses through the material of the structure to a surface where heat signatures are monitored using infra-red thermographic camera technologies. Vibrothermographic testing methods, developed in the late 1970's with the advent of improved IR camera technologies, have been somewhat slow to develop, due in part to a lack of understanding of the physics surrounding damaged areas of structures. The focus of this research is on the use of Finite Element (FE) Analysis, using ANSYSÂ® software, to simulate the Vibrothermographic method. One goal of the research is to produce algorithms predicting the likely-hood of thermal detection of numerous delamination flaws within a fiberglass/epoxy composite plate. The FE modeling attempts accurately characterize harmonic responses surrounding the ""damaged"" regions (flaw areas) of the plate. Harmonic response analyses are performed on the FE plate model, and nodal harmonic displacement data is subsequently utilized within transient analysis sub-modeling procedures. Each of the nine delamination flaws are analyzed within these sub-modeling procedures and the rates at which frictional heat energy dissipation, due rubbing, occur at the flaw faces are derived. Each delamination sub-model is subjected to a high-resolution frequency sweep analysis, where frequency dependent heat generation data is collected over a frequency bandwidth of 800-30000Hz. The latter portion of the paper discusses the use of a novel finite element approach to estimating the likely hood of thermal detections for the flaws. The approach uses generic finite element model to predict thermal detection times for an expansive set of flaw and testing parameters. A response surface method of curve-fitting is applied to the collected detection time data, and the resulting equation is subsequently used to predict the heat-signature detectability for each flaw. The results of this method are ultimately compared to empirical vibrothermographic frequency-sweep data, and a preliminary assessment of the viability of the approach is made."

This study quantifies the effect of the physiography (elevation, potential incoming solar radiation, land cover, etc.) of a large (207 km 2) and complex mountainous basin on the spatial distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE) and snow density during peak SWE accumulation. SWE and snow density were sampled in areas of the basin that were physiographically representative (based on unique combinations of elevation, incoming solar radiation, and land cover) to the basin as a whole. Sampling took place over a variety of spatial scales (10m-400m) in a semi-random and structured manner acquiring over 1,000 direct measurements of SWE and snow density. Three modeling approaches were used in the analysis of the SWE data; regression tree, conditional inference tree, and mixed effects multiple regression. The three modeling approaches were similar in their estimates of total basin SWE (approximately within 1% of their averages) but provided very different patterns of how SWE is spatially distributed throughout the basin. All three methods showed elevation and potential incoming solar radiation to have the most significant influence on the spatial distribution of SWE, with land cover also being significant in the mixed effects and conditional inference tree models. Snow density was observed to vary widely throughout the basin with a standard deviation of 61 kg/m 3 around a mean of 349 kg/m 3. The spatial distribution of density was modeled using regression tree and multiple linear regression analysis. Both models estimated similar basin average snow density using elevation and radiation as explanatory variables, but displayed considerably different spatial distributions and ranges of value. This study demonstrates the importance of elevation and radiation for modeling the spatial distribution of SWE and snow density in a large and physiographically diverse basin and expresses the differences that exist between various methods of modeling these phenomena.

While consumer utilization studies are ongoing, a paucity of published literature exists to study health care provider's perceptions of the significance of these changes. The purpose of this research was to quantify health care provider's familiarity, utilization of SMT, and perceptions of benefits and barriers to use in professional practice. This was a non-experimental descriptive phenomenological study. The study population (n=310) included health care providers (M.D., D..O., ND, NP, PA) employed with a regional, Western health care system. This study was conducted using a concurrent, mixed-methods approach. A validated survey, developed using Pender's Health Promotion Model, was distributed to the target population by the organization's Nursing Research Council (NRC). Response rate was 20% with an age range of 27-70 years. Gender included females (50.8%) and males (49.2%). Tenure in practice included < 5 years (16.9%), 5-10 years (15.3%), 10-20 years (30.5%), and 20 + years (37.3%). Respondents were primarily M.Ds (62.7%), followed by D.O. (1.7%), N.D. (1.7%), NPs (16.9%), and PAs (16.9%). Familiarity with the term ""social media"" was 95% with personal account ownership (62.7%). Utilization of SMT in practice varied by application with 78.7% indicating no current use followed by health education (13.1%), practice promotion (6.6%), scheduling and appointment reminders by text (4.9%), interactive patient communities (4.9%), and patient self-management tools (1.6%). Smartphone utilization was 98.3% with 69.5% accessing health care applications. Sixty one percent perceived benefit of SMT in improving patient care, but 53% disagreed or strongly disagreed with benefit for clinical decision-making. Predominant barriers to SMT in practice included: uncertainty of legal implications, time commitment to monitor, and patient/provider confidentiality concerns. Power-users were younger, were 4 times more likely to utilize smartphones to access health care related applications, 3.4 times more interested in SMT benefits, and 3.5 times more likely to anticipate future SMT use in practice. SMT may be most useful as a complement to traditional delivery modalities."	['social media']

In places where mountain goats are non-native there are concerns over potential competition between the two species. The southern Gallatin Mountain range, within and adjacent to the northwest boundary of Yellowstone National Park has both native bighorn sheep and non-native mountain goats. Existing observations of both species for this area vary in spatial precision and there are no records of where observers looked for animals but did not detect them. To gain a better understanding of the relationship between bighorn sheep and mountain goats and their habitat, it is necessary to understand resource selection and the extent of overlap in resource use at fine spatial and temporal scales. I used logistic regression to relate existing presence-only bighorn sheep and mountain goat data for this area to landscape features I expected would be important to both species. Using resulting coefficient estimates, I constructed a relative habitat suitability map and used it to define four survey regions within the study area. The crew of four spent 113 observer days afield and hiked 210 miles recording occupancy data for both mountain ungulates within these four survey regions. Observers surveyed 6,603 100 x 100 meter grid cells, with 15 groups of bighorn sheep and 34 groups of mountain goats observed during surveys. Because there were more mountain goat observations available, I used only mountain goat data to conduct formal occupancy analyses. Mountain goat occupancy was positively associated with ruggedness at the 100 meter scale and there was an important interaction between distance to escape terrain and tree cover at the 500 meter scale. As the distance to escape terrain increased mountain goats were less likely to occupy treed areas. The ruggedness index used in my presence-only modeling effort was based on the rate of change in slope. By using a ruggedness index which included changes in slope and aspect I improved model performance. This research demonstrates the feasibility of conducting occupancy surveys in mountainous terrain and provides interesting biological insights regarding mountain goats and their habitat.

These algae exhibit a dynamic seasonal biomass fluctuation referred to as 'mat decline,' where viability drastically decreases as seasonal ultra-violet (UV) and visible (VIS) irradiance intensify. Temporal experiments coupling UV irradiance filtering with whole-community transcription profiling revealed significant cyanidial gene expression changes occurring as a result of exposure to UV, and that patterns of response adjusted across low and high irradiance time periods. Separate analyses examined genes responding to either increasing seasonal UV or VIS intensity, or by the combined effects of both irradiance wavelengths (UV and VIS). Results not only corroborated known physiological changes to solar irradiance, but also suggested the strategies employed to deal with excess VIS and UV intensity may be highly integrated. Comparative analysis determined that environmental microarrays are highly sensitive in their detection of transcript diversity, and in situ gene expression changes. Proteomic work identified several dominant cyanidial proteins which were also abundantly transcribed, suggesting there is good correspondence between highly abundant proteins and gene transcriptional activity for these algae. Additionally, a study is presented which examined the biodiversity and distribution of the Cyanidiales in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Phylogenetic reconstruction using the rbcL gene sequence identified two well-supported YNP lineages: Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria-A, and showed the separation of taxa based on ecophysiological conditions. Galdieria-A phylotypes were found exclusively in soil and endolithic habitats. Cyanidioschyzon was the sole phylotype found in aqueous environments, but was also detected in all soil and endolithic habitats investigated. Culturing efforts demonstrated that moisture availability controls cyanidial viability and distribution in soil habitats, while alternative environmental factors influence endolithic populations. In addition, autotrophic and heterotrophic viable cell counts in combination with rbcL gene sequencing determined that Galdieria dominates the species composition in soil environments, while the endolithic habitat contains both Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria.

Highway agencies expend significant resources on the installation, upgrading and maintenance of traffic control devices. To ascertain that those resources are well invested, it is important to know whether traffic control devices serve their intended purpose. The answer may be easy for some traffic control devices such as traffic signals, regulatory signs and guide signs, but it may be more difficult for other devices such as warning signs in general and those intended for occasional hazards in particular. Examples of these occasional hazards are railroad crossings, icy bridges, unexpected alignment and/or geometry, falling rocks, wildlife crossings, etc. For regulatory and guide signs, drivers feel an âobligationâ to use the information provided by those signs; in the case of warning signs, the use of information and driversâ reactions seem to be based more on perception of risk. The effectiveness of static warning signs for occasional hazards is questionable because those signs typically are posted with out the hazard being perceived by drivers. Subsequently, highway agencies have begun to question the feasibility of expending significant resources on the installation and maintenance of these signs when little evidence exists regarding their effectiveness in improving highway safety. Knowing the effectiveness of these signs in improving safety is important for highway agencies to assess the feasibility of using conventional signs and whether alternative warning devices are required for a safer highway environment.

He asks Sally to keep the information confidential because important federal documents have yet to be filed. Sally agrees to do so. Two days later, a coworker asks Sally if she knows anything about the rumor regarding the grant status and possible layoffs. When Sally hesitates, the coworker says, âLook, this is serious. People could lose their jobs. Do I need to cut back on spending? Do you know anything?â What should Sally do? Should she be honest? She does know something, and she feels a sense of loyalty to her coworkers. Or should she say nothing? She does have a duty to maintain confidentiality, and she agreed to do so. This situation, adapted from Joseph Badaraccoâs 1997 book Defining Moments: When Managers Must Choose Between Right and Right, illustrates perfectly the not-so black- and-white area of ethics. With ethics, you often have to choose not between right and wrong, but between right and right (or right and good). And what is right and what is good are not always the same thing.

Crop producers whose yields are highly correlated with county yield are most likely to use this product to insure that the combination of yield and price results in a particular level of revenue. Unlike the related Risk Management Agency-approved Group Risk Plan insurance, either a price or yield decline may result in a producer being indemnified. If total revenue (price times yield) in county is less than a producerâs trigger revenue, the producer will be indemnified for revenue losses due to insurable causes. But producers need to recognize that they could incur reduced revenue from the insured acres of a crop and not be indemnified if there is not a commensurate decline in county per acre revenues for the crop.

Forty-seven college students completed a 24- hour dietary recall and Dietary Awareness Survey measuring demographic characteristics of participants, knowledge of the Food Guide Pyramid (FGP), support for federal dietary guidance, and self-efficacy for eating healthy. Adherence to FGP recommendations was low among participants, as were knowledge, support, and self-efficacy scores. No significant correlation was found between knowledge and intake. While there was no evidence of association between support, self-efficacy, and adherence, support was significantly correlated with increased fruit intake, and self-efficacy was associated with decreased intake of soft drinks. Lastly, those adhering to overall and dairy FGP recommendations had higher BMI scores than those not adhering. These results suggest limited retention of nutrition guide recommendations, as well as psychosocial determinants of adherence beyond intrapersonal factors. Limitations included, self-reported weight and dietary intake data, which may have introduced response bias, as well as a small, homogenous sample, limiting external validity. Future research should examine the role of interpersonal and environmental constructs in affecting dietary intake, as well as the association between dairy intake and weight status.

The project was implemented over an eight week period. The first intervention phase was a teacher-oriented lecture-based environment on the topic of motion. No technology was accessible during the first phase. The second phase introduced the students to the PBL model and engaged them in the process of understanding speed through questioning, research and collaboration using Web 2.0 tools. The second phase, also referred to as intervention one, lasted 12 school days. Students had full access to computers and were directed through the stages of inquiry. This intervention phase was both teacher and student-directed with the teacher acting as facilitator for the latter portion of the lessons. The final intervention lasted 14 school days with full use of technology for all aspects of the class. Students studied Newton's laws, completed research, and collaborated on the development of a moving car that modeled Newton's Third Law. Following the PBL model students led the discussions, freely engaged in the learning, openly discussed and argued the points of their project research as well as the models that they created. Students showed improvement in assessments without any negative performance impact and in general responded positively on the Likert surveys that they wanted to continue to help with the project research, continue learning in the PBL inquiry model, and continue to have access to technology as a tool for learning.

Students in such classes are expected to learn these outcomes, as well as, participate in classroom assignments and activities. Cooperative pre-activities and cooperative learning structures were used to foster student curiosity, encourage dialogue and question asking between students. The pre-activities allowed students to gain some prior knowledge that would not only enhance cognitive development, but increase self-confidence and motivation to become more engaged in the learning environment. The additional cooperative learning structures improved cognitive development, as well as, social development in the classroom. In addition, teacher motivation and improved pedagogy also impacted the learning environment in a positive manner.

Data was collected over four units of study; one of which acted as a non-treatment group, two were treatment groups that used CBL once during the unit to help solidify the information being taught, and one treatment group used CBL as the main method to teach the students the content of the unit. Surveys, interviews, classroom monitoring, pretests, and posttests were all used as means to collect data. They compared the engagement levels, the skills developed for career and college readiness, and critical thinking skills of students using traditional methods versus CBL. From the data collected, there was no conclusive evidence to support an improvement in college preparedness. Student motivation and engagement increased slightly for CBL and there was a definite improvement in higher-order thinking skills after the use of any CBL throughout these units.

69966	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3542	The effects of documented problem solutions on problem solving skills for introductory college physics courses	My students struggle to solve physics word problems when the solution is not explicitly given to them. They can understand abstract concepts and repeat a problem that is solved correctly for them but cannot solve word problems that are new. The ability to solve problems should be a skill that a student acquires or improves at as a result of taking a college physics course. Over the past several years of teaching I have noticed that despite my best efforts, I have not observed any measurable improvement in my students' abilities to solve physics problems. As a physics teacher, I needed to find some way to help my students become more comfortable and learn to enjoy solving physics problems. This capstone projects investigates the use of formative assessments on determining what changes can be implemented in teaching that might help students become more proficient at solving physics problems.

In order to address this, I created several 'preflights', which students completed after watching video lectures, but before coming to class. Two of my classes comprised the treatment group and two others comprised the comparison group. I wanted to determine the impact of preflights on student learning, including whether they help students understand video lecture material more effectively and whether they increase student confidence in their learning. I also wished to try out various formats of preflights to see which was most effective for student learning. I found that preflights had a positive effect on student learning overall, and modestly increased student confidence in their learning. Based on student interviews and other data, I determined that the most effective and preferred format of preflight was a guided tutorial, where I led students through a problem, and then asked them to perform a similar task. I concluded that in general, preflights were an effective way to increase student performance and confidence in their learning.

The initiative began with the dissemination of laptop computers to each student in grades 9 through 12 combined with training for the teachers on how to use the technology. I gathered data for the investigation through surveys and interviews in order to ascertain the efficacy and success of the initiative from the perspectives of the students and teachers. The feedback from students and teachers alike was mixed, but showed an overall neutral feeling about the initiative. The data suggests that greater technology implementation can have a positive impact on the quality of education but only if it is implemented with adequate support.

This action research project was designed to test if strengthening a word's meaning by increasing exposure time through visual representation would allow for comprehension of the overall concept to follow. It also takes a look at the effects visual representation has on a child's attitude towards vocabulary. The treatment unit consisted of additional exposure time of vocabulary words through visual representations and a day of review before the chapter test. The visual representations took place in the form of a concept wheel, Venn diagram, word map and web. Results of the study indicate that there was not significant growth between the treatment unit and the non-treatment unit.

The need for a strong vocabulary background is evident especially for at-risk students who might have very little support at home. Students were not scoring well on assessments due to the lack of understanding of scientific terminology and poor study habits. The school system provided an afterschool homework help, but a majority of the eighth grade students did not take advantage of this. To provide additional support, I restructured my class period as well as my teaching style to encompass a stronger vocabulary base by making vocabulary a focus and activities encouraging vocabulary building. Throughout the study my eighth grade students used a variety of methods and methodologies to show improvement in their knowledge of science context. This study used formative and summative assessments, observations, surveys, activities, and student perceptions of scientific terminology. I found that with increased class time spent with a variety of activities such as flashcards, jeopardy, BINGO, and other ways to review, students remembered and test scores improved as did terminology usage in student writing.

69973	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3550	The effects of the 5E learning cycle on student integration of science vocabulary	Teachers at Elmhurst Community Prep have been using a traditional approach to teach vocabulary to middle school students for the past 5 years. This strategy involves frontloading terms and definitions using a worksheet which requires students to record each word and definition and then create a sentence and image prior to interacting with the content. The expected outcome of strategy was to support students who were reading below their grade level. Data from classroom assessments and state testing showed that 8th grade students continued to struggle reading text, worksheets and assessment questions. However, on occasions when inquiry instruction was used, student assessments scores increased. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the 5E Learning Cycle on 8th grade physical science students' ability to use vocabulary on written assignments, discourse and assessments. Students were given an opportunity to engage and explore content prior to the introduction of vocabulary. Students also time to interact with vocabulary through practice and interactive games on the computer. Pre-treatment and post-treatment data was collected using student assessment data, student notebooks, written assignments, teacher observations and surveys. The results of the study show most students made gains in their academic performance. Whole grade level data, from classroom assessments, showed a gain of 5% for both male and female students. However, the data also revealed that African American females gained 11% on assessment scores and Vietnamese females gained 8%. Another notable gain, of 7% was identified among female English Language Learners. In addition to improved student performance on assessments, students' opinion and engagement with vocabulary improved. The results of this study suggest that inquiry based instruction does improve students ability to use and engage with vocabulary with the greatest gains among female students.

Through the use of cooperative-learning strategies students are tasked with working collaboratively towards a shared goal. Each lesson utilizes peer to peer learning and self-discovery. One nontreatment unit was taught using traditional, teacher-centered lessons and compared to two treatment units which were taught using cooperative-learning strategies. While data collected for all students' understanding yielded mixed results, data showed definitive improvements in student understanding for the high-achieving students. Results also showed improvement in long-term memory, and a modest increase in attitudes, and engagement for all students and teacher's attitude. Using cooperative-learning strategies in my classroom presented an initial challenge to both me and the students, but after the first treatment unit was completed familiarity with the strategies allowed for a higher level of engagement and understanding. Because of this, I am excited about continueing the use of cooperative-learning strategies into my teaching in the future.

From September 2013 to April 2014, scientific practices were integrated into newly designed ninth grade religious education lessons, using inquiry-based learning strategies and fundamental Catholic teachings. Classroom environment and Catholic resources were overhauled to provide students with Catholic Study Bibles, YouCats, YouCat Study Guides, YouCat Prayer books, Scripture reference sheets, Samsung tablets, and a lab-like setting, with elevated tables, stools, journals, and mini-whiteboards. Over the course of 20 lessons, scientific practices, including: asking questions and defining problems, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematics and simulation thinking, constructing explanations, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information, were implemented with innovative demonstrations, case studies, peer-to-peer service projects, and mock court sessions to improve students' faith knowledge and engagement. With meaningful and relevant topics, mini-lectures with PowerPoint, Prezis, and video accompanied practices in lessons. Incorporating scientific practices proved to be an effective way for students to learn and personally engage in the Catholic faith. The Religious Education & Scientific Practices Questionnaire indicated that 92% of ninth grade students believed that scientific practices had a positive impact on their faith learning (N=12). One student reported, ""This year I have learned more than I ever had in religion."" Another student said scientific practices ""made class more interesting than in other years."" Ninety-two percent of surveyed students reported that using scientific practices in religious education lessons improved faith knowledge and 75% stated that scientific practices are an effective way of improving faith knowledge. Before scientific practices, 0% of students felt knowledgeable about their faith. After scientific practices, 75% of students surveyed strongly agreed that they felt knowledgeable about their faith. Data further revealed heightened engagement in students' religious education experience. Before practices, 17% of respondents strongly agreed that religious education classes were interesting and engaging. After practices, 75% strongly agreed that lessons were more engaging. One student reported, ""It made the classes more interesting. I didn't know what was going to happen next."""

While many state teaching standards require educators to attend a cultural awareness course as part of the licensure process, there is a lack of culturally relevant materials available to educators. The need to develop culturally relevant resources that is engaging to Native American students has driven many educators to develop their own material. In this study, educators spent time researching and developing a cultural plant field guide to use within their environmental education and outreach program on the reservation. Participants were given questionnaires, content knowledge self-assessments, and structured interviews in order to determine their knowledge of cultural plants before and after the activity, what resources they relied on when identifying and researching cultural plants, as well as their perspective on developing their own resources. The results from the data collection methods showed that educators had minimal knowledge of cultural plants as well as minimal knowledge on where to locate resources on this subject. Their frustration in finding appropriate resources to utilize was notable and brought awareness as to a void that needed to be filled. While the educators expressed their desire to utilize existing resources to teach with they did note that the process of developing their own material provided them with a better background knowledge and confidence of the material as well as a the likelihood that they would utilize the material they created in the future.

A series of surveys were given to the students in two classes at the beginning and end of the school year, as well as midway through the fall and spring semesters. Student responses were sought for opinions on the impact of the iPad on organization, homework completion, test preparation, extended individual pursuit of topical class information, and the possibility of distractions. Twelve individual student interviews were also undertaken to elicit extended, candid responses to related questions. Parent surveys were administered to gauge familiarity with the device and estimate of their child's school experience and productivity due to the presence of the iPad. Departmental science teachers were surveyed to investigate opinions on their overview of the program, professional fulfillment from the program, challenges confronted, and possible enhancement of student learning outcomes in light of introduction of the device. The collected data suggested increased homework completion, perceived better test preparation, and reading assignment participation for the students. Distractions due to game playing were a real challenge in this initial year of the program, as noted by students, parents, and teachers. Due in part to this challenge, levels of teacher frustration were reported as higher, with personal fulfillment possibly diminished. Nevertheless, with more practice, future positive outcomes are believed to be possible in differentiated instruction, student engagement in school, and the further integration of technology into the science laboratory.

This question arose because of the increasing number of students failing the class, as a result of zero's being recorded for missing homework, even though they were proficient and passing the chapter tests. Two classes were selected and compared on proficiency, chapter test scores and overall grades after each unit. Student interviews, surveys, and questionnaires were also used to identify the impact of homework in science. It was determined that ninth grade students in physical science do not need to have graded homework assignments in order to display proficiency on tests and pass the class with an above average grade.

Progress was tracked using practice tests for the Science Measurement of Student Progress (MSP), which utilized writing scenarios on a variety of topics. These tests had two main writing components, a conclusion and creating a procedure. Students completed a pretest and posttest using the same Powerful Classroom Assessment (PCA). In between these, students also completed another Powerful Classroom Assessment and a 2012 MSP Released Item. My 8th grade class was broken up into six subgroups by either special needs or scores on the 7th grade Writing MSP. In language arts class, students learned the PEEL process for paragraph writing that stands for Point, Evidence, Explanation, and Link. Students then employed this scaffold in classes across the curriculum, including science, throughout the year. Results showed improvement in student scores on the conclusion questions, especially for using data to support a claim. Student scores did improve to same extent with the procedure questions. The conclusion from the data is that using the PEEL paragraph writing process in multiple classes throughout the year improved students' ability to use evidence to explain a claim.

This project evaluated how teachers bringing groups to the Museum of the Rockies used the Taylor Planetarium as a learning tool. Teachers who visited the Museum between October 2013 and March of 2014 were asked to participate by answering questions via online surveys and phone interviews. Each teacher was asked to do this before and after their visit to the Taylor Planetarium to measure how their preparation before the visit impacted their students and themselves. After their visit, each participating teacher completed a survey to gather data on the purpose of school group visits, perceptions of student engagement, and instructional techniques used during their visit. Additionally, I contacted planetarium directors from the Pacific Northwest to gather data on their practices and ideas. This project generated evidence that there is a considerable need to increase the communication level between Montana's teachers and the Museum of the Rockies to enhance the learning experience of the students they bring in to see a planetarium show.

Specifically, will using science fiction increase levels of student engagement, reinforce science content learned in class, increase science literacy skills, and finally to determine if there will be an increased interest in science related careers. Students were introduced to science fiction reading material along with regular content. The methodology continues with the students collaborating and developing their literacy skills using short pieces of science fiction with writing prompts and research questions. The final portion of the treatment consisted of the students reading a science fiction book, researching the science concepts within the text, then presenting the project to their peers. The data analysis incorporated several pieces of quantitative and qualitative evidence. These include student pre and post attitudinal surveys, student work samples of written responses, personal interviews, and rubric based presentations. The data was collected from three different classes; Earth Science (N=8), Biology (N=10) and Chemistry (N=8). The data revealed the lower level Earth Science had the most decreases in interest for science reading and pursuing careers in science, as opposed to the Biology and Chemistry classes showing increases in interest in both areas. All of the classes demonstrated increases in abilities for science research and performance on the student presentations indicate science literacy increased as well. Overall there was a positive response from students with regards to levels of engagement and achievement.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

Traditional laboratory exercises were conducted over a unit of study and comparisons of pre-laboratory and post-laboratory quizzes were analyzed between students who participated in the pre-laboratory activity and those who did not. iPad technology was utilized as a means of conducting pre-laboratory activities, pre- and post-laboratory quizzes, and student surveys. Data from student interviews, teacher journal, and end of unit assessment was also analyzed. While student performance on post-laboratory quizzes and end of unit assessment was not significantly affected by the pre-laboratory activities, students did report feeling more prepared for laboratory activities after participating in pre-laboratory activities. Benefits of pre-laboratory activities were noted in student organization and participation, and student support of technology use in science class was high.

Throughout the 12 week research period, 13 projects or activities were included in the algebra curriculum. Projects included card games to help reinforce integer operations, order of operations puzzles, equation bingo, and six teleconferences with NASA engineers about applications of mathematics outside of the classroom. Through student surveys, interviews, and summative assessment scores, in addition to a classroom observation journal by the teacher, data was collected on the effects of project-based learning. The data showed an improvement in pre and post test results. The increase was a positive outcome of the research, but was not substantial enough to prove project-based learning in high school algebra is the most successful way to teach the material. It was found students who have extrovert personalities are more receptive and benefit more from project-based learning. Introvert personalities struggle with project-based activities due to social anxiety preventing them from fully participating in the activity. The results of the data analysis did show a substantial increase in students' attitudes towards math. By the end of the treatment students made positive comments concerning math and wrote about how math is important for their futures. The students who made the positive comments were more likely to complete assignments and study to understand the material. Overall, the research showed project-based learning as being a good teaching tool to help motivate students to learn.

This paper examines the effects of using clickers on student academic performance as well as evaluating student's perspectives on the use of these devices in the classrooms. Thirty-two students were surveyed in two college preparatory physics classes over two semesters. The fall semester students used the clickers while the spring semester students did not... Result showed that student interest and confidence in the material presented seemed greater with the use of these devices. This increased confidence however did not correlate with higher test scores results showed that, 33% of students using clickers scored an A or B on semester exams while 43% did so without the use of clickers. In conclusion clickers did not seem to improve academic success in the classroom and may be used to encourage student participation in the classroom.

69988	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3567	The impacts of class websites on student engagement in middle school science	The purpose of this action research-based classroom project was to understand the impacts of class websites on student engagement in middle school science as well as on student autonomy, student attitude towards homework, and teacher practices. This study was a descriptive study in which 7th and 8th grade science students were observed over a period of a little over four months during which class websites were used in a variety of capacities. It was determined through direct observation, interviews, class assignments, and surveys that class websites increase students' sense of autonomy, but do not change students' feelings about homework. From this research it could not be determined if student engagement is affected by the use of websites, but it was found that teacher practices were positively influenced.

69989	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3568	Measuring the effectiveness of projects and student learning ownership through differentiated assessments in science	The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of choice in assessment style in the science classroom, and to measure the reliability of projects as assessment instruments relative to teacher-generated tests. I also planned to measure student attitudes towards having choice in the style of their assessment, and to see if student ownership of learning increased with the use of formative assessments while completing the project. The intervention took place over a four week period in March and April of 2014, and it involved 23 ninth grade biology students at New Canaan Country School, a small independent day school in New Canaan, CT. During the intervention, students first completed a unit on DNA structure and replication. One group was assessed with a test, and the other group was assessed on a project in the format of their choosing. A crossover study model was used here, so that at the end of the second unit on protein synthesis, each group had completed both a test and a project. Data collection involved both quantitative and qualitative measures: a comparison of those tests and project results, student attitude surveys, teacher observations, and a student questionnaire. Results suggest that projects are a reliable assessment instrument; they were largely preferred by students, and students were more involved in the process of their own learning, demonstrated by reported time spent on task and effectiveness of formative assessment pieces.

The Claims-Evidence-Reasoning (C-E-R) writing framework may be a means to this end. Explanations begin with a claim which makes an assertion or a conclusion about a question, problem, or observation. The evidence supports the claim using scientific data. The reasoning part of an explanation is used to justify that the students' evidence supports their claim, explains why the observations or data count as evidence of this claim by providing scientific principles. The framework was used with a variety of lesson types in astronomy and chemistry units. Students reported that the C-E-R framework helped them learn science content. The C-E-R framework also improved students' understanding of the nature of science.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

While reflecting on possible reasons for the decline, I narrowed it down to the three most common reasons students seek my help during office hours. These were difficulty with note taking, poor time management and failure to learn from errors. This project evaluated the effect of teaching metacognitive strategies on academic performance, self-efficacy, and ability of students to select appropriate metacognitive strategies. Students were taught time management and study strategies along with reflection activities. Data collection for this project included surveys, interviews, field notes, and exam scores. The results indicated that note taking, study skills and time management improved. Self-efficacy remained the same while academic performance results were inconclusive. The positive outcomes from this project have encouraged me to continue implementing these strategies.

69992	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3571	The effects of teaching the nature of science on higher order thinking skills in a freshmen level physical science high school course	"As I have developed as a science teacher, I have become more concerned with helping students learn to ""think like a scientist"" rather than memorize science content. With the release of the Next Generation Science Standards in April of 2013, I was further inspired to rework the school's current science curriculum to make time for teaching students to think. Over the summer of 2013, I developed a six week Nature of Science unit which used the eight benchmarks published in the Next Generation Science Standards. The Nature of Science focuses on the ""how"" of science and I thought it would help me achieve my goal of making students become critical thinkers. While it may seem intuitive teaching the Nature of Science may result in better higher order of thinking skills, my project focused on attempting to verify whether students improved in their ability to analyze, synthesize and evaluate scientific information. Prior to the start of the newly developed Nature of Science unit and following it, my freshmen physical science course took a previous year's standardized test (ACT Explore), completed a survey over their higher order thinking skills, developed a scientific experiment from given background during an assignment, and developed a second scientific experiment with the use of a computer simulator and collected data. The surveys provided the opportunity for me to learn about all three of their higher order thinking skills, the standardized tests shed light on their analysis and evaluation abilities, while the students developed scientific experiments provided information over their synthesis skills. The largest gains from the Nature of Science unit were in student evaluation ability. This was evidenced by increases in the ACT Explore Test conflicting view point portion and more students self identifying through the survey of being at a higher level. Student ability to synthesize and analyze scientific information did not seem to change nearly as much. As I look to improve the unit for future years, I will be incorporating more activities which allow students the opportunity to analyze and synthesize scientific information in the context of the Nature of Science."

69993	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3572	What are the effects of standards-based grading on student learning and behavior in the secondary science classroom?	Over the last few years of my teaching career I grew frustrated with some recurring problems that I attributed to my points-based grading system. Parents and students seemed to focus more on earning points than on learning. When students and their parents came in for help they asked about making up assignments for partial credit and about earning extra credit, but rarely sought help in understanding content or mastering skills. Homework was often completed quickly with little effort, and feedback given on homework and tests was usually ignored. When I looked into the research I found that points-based grading systems were often inaccurate and conveyed little information to parents, teachers, and students to improve future learning. Many assessment experts recommended switching to a standards-based grading system (SBG). For this project three high school biology classrooms were assessed with a traditional points-based grading system for the fall semester, and then a SBG system was implemented in the spring semester. During the treatment the curriculum was broken into standards and specific learning objectives. All assignments and quizzes were tied to these standards, and short quizzes were used to assign individual grades to each learning objective. Non-academic achievement factors such as attendance, attitude, behavior, and homework punctuality were recorded separately but not included in students' academic grades. Students were allowed to re-assess over learning objectives throughout the grading period. Data collection involved an attitude survey, which was given both spring and fall semesters, student interviews, unit assessment scores from both semesters, and semester exams. I also recorded field notes to document summaries of interactions I had with students who asked for help or asked about their grades.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

The results did not reveal a noteworthy difference. What I did find significant is students' perceptions that crib sheets are helpful, and I plan to utilize crib sheets next year. My primary action research question was, ""What are the effects of crib sheets compared with open notebooks on student assessment in an introductory high school earth science class?"" A crib sheet, also known as a cheat sheet, is a student constructed paper that is used to provide help during an assessment. Secondary questions investigated included: How do students perceive the usefulness of crib sheets? How do crib sheets impact student test anxiety? What are the effects of crib sheets compared to open notebooks on the length of time students spend on assessments? How do the results of my research affect me as a teacher? My results mimicked what I found in my literature review. Overall my quantitative results did not support nor refute the use of crib sheets for improvement in assessment scores. Low student participation in constructing and using crib sheets contributed to the lack of conclusive results. However qualitative survey data did indicate that crib sheets could be helpful. The last survey showed that almost half of the students indicated they saw the value of crib sheets for improving their scores. The greatest benefit for me in the immediate future is the direction that this project has given me for next year. I am convinced that the use of crib sheets can aid student learning and performance on assessments. To be successful I believe that students will need instruction in how to prepare a crib sheet. I hadn't anticipated the concern that came to light through my research this past year. This issue is that student participation in learning activities is the lowest I have experienced in my eight years of teaching. I believe the greatest education we can give others isn't learning facts or procedures rather it is gaining the attitudes of positivity and perseverance."

Students were divided into two groups for the unit taught on light. Four classes, 122 students, were taught using cooperative learning strategies this was compared to two classes, 65 students, who were taught the same information without the use of cooperative learning strategies. Due to the short duration of the intervention most of the results were not significant, although the students' willingness to work together did show improvement in the group of students who were taught with cooperative learning strategies compared to the students who were not taught this way.

69997	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/3576	The effects of open inquiry versus guided inquiry on student achievement and enthusiasm for science	The purpose of this action research was to identify the benefits of inquiry education on student enthusiasm, and abilities to form, analyze, and apply data in a way that allows for thorough conclusions, connections and retention. Open inquiry techniques were being compared against guided inquiry techniques to see which method achieved the best results. To compare these two techniques, three chapters of one unit were used throughout the treatment. The first chapter had all students participate in conducting an open inquiry lab, to grow confident in the expected procedures. In the second and third chapters, students were broken into two groups. One group conducted an open inquiry lab over that chapter's topic, and the other group conducted a guided inquiry lab provided by me. These groups switched their roles from guided to open inquiry or vice versa during chapter three. During the course of the intervention, data were gathered through pre and post intervention surveys and interviews, discussion participation and comments record, formative chapter assessments, a summative unit assessment, a post-intervention inquiry assessment, lab report analysis, and record of student resources. Evidence from surveys, interviews and discussions showed that student enthusiasm for science did increase with the greater use of inquiry; however, their excitement for open inquiry decreased. Students preferred to prepare for, conduct, and complete lab reports over guided inquiry labs because they felt more focused allowing them to learn more from the experience. Students' dislike for lab reports increased throughout the extent of the study. Also, their abilities for drawing thorough conclusions and forming connections did not vary much throughout the lab, but did increase more with guided inquiry. Formative assessments pointed to a more success from students currently taking part in open inquiry; however, according to the summative unit assessment, retention of knowledge was more greatly sustained with the use of guided inquiry. It is clear that the use of inquiry provides many benefits within the science classroom, and both guided and open inquiry forms have purpose. However, my results indicate that guided inquiry is more efficient, highly enjoyed, and maintains greater retention.

Assignments include discussions, question/answer prompts, quizzes, glossary building exercises, and much more. The purpose of this study was to see if the level of peer to peer interaction of the different Moodle assignments influenced their effectiveness as learning tools. A goal of the study was to also determine if student preferences for particular styles of assignments on Moodle were based on the level of peer interaction involved. Pre and post assessments were given for four units of study in the biology curriculum to measure student growth under different Moodle assignment style treatments. Surveys and interviews were given toward the end of the study to determine student preferences and attitudes toward the different assignment styles. It was found that student perceptions of Moodle assignment contributions to learning were positive overall with mixed views on the different styles of assignments. Reasoning behind preferences for particular styles ranged from ease of completion to a perceived beneficial contribution to learning course content.

Specific focus was paid to measuring the effect on student engagement, interest, and content mastery. It was also of interest whether the inquiry activities were more effective when implemented before or after direct instruction of the content. The research covered three units of study. During the Pre-treatment unit on Newton's 3rd Law and Momentum, students did not receive any special treatment, but rather experienced my traditional style of teaching with lectures, note taking, a few standard lab type activities, and short video supplements. In each of the next two units, the first on Work, Power, and the Conservation of Energy and the second on Heat and Heat Transfer, students were introduced to guided inquiry activities. The students were split into two research groups. In the first of the treatment units, group A received direct instruction first and group B experienced the inquiry activities prior to direct instruction. In the second of the treatment units, the two groups' experiences were switched. Data from class surveys, pre- and post- tests, and a mock assessment with a standardized test agreed that overall not only did students prefer the inquiry activities to the previous class structure, their understanding of the physics content was also increased. Students were more engaged while conducting inquiry activities and actually requested to do more of these types of activities. Furthermore, it was found that the inquiry activities were more effective when they followed a period of direct instruction rather than being used to introduce a topic.

They are tools that enable students to become actively engaged in their learning and encourage concept exploration and assist in developing their inquiry skills. It is through the implementation of a series of inquiry based student activities that these simulations will be evaluated for their effectiveness in improving conceptual understanding. The results of this study revealed that traditional instruction supplemented with computer simulations helped students perform better on short term conceptual assessments. The use of computer simulations improved student achievement and had a positive influence on student's attitudes to learning conceptual chemistry concepts.

It looked at the effects on student achievement, student attitude towards learning, and the way curriculum is taught. It also attempted to determine whether the type of formative assessment, conceptual or quantitative, makes a difference in the outcome. The data showed that overall performance on the formative assessments doesn't correlate well with summative assessment performance. However, there is a possible correlation between the type of formative assessment given and performance on corresponding questions on exams. Overall, students had a positive perception of formative assessments as a tool for learning. Formatives assessment were also shown to be an effective means to adjust curriculum during and after instruction.

In addition a major aim was to improve the mastery of astronomy themed concepts within that thematic unit, especially as measured with common misconceptions related to its content. The treatment incorporated new or redesigned activities, use of models, labs, and unit assignments, assessment strategies, and measured academic growth using a newly implemented pretest and posttest. These results were compared to a pretest and posttest given on the subsequent thematic unit where curriculum was not modified. Data gathered showed that the curriculum that was reworked enabled greater test score growth despite challenges in student moon journal participation and scoring.

This project examined the impact of using tablet computers for middle level instruction at Hobson Public Schools in Hobson, Montana. Students were provided the tablets at the beginning of the year and data was collected from the administrator, teaching staff and students on the changes in teacher preparation, student/teacher interaction, and district policy needed to make the tablet use successful. It was found that teacher preparation time increased and that teachers needed more professional development. District policies were driven by concerns over technology misuse and led to restricted access to the tablets. Consequently, student/teacher interactions did not change significantly.

Students were given opportunities to learn real world science and develop new skills. Students worked with scientists and principal investigators from different NASA missions through different Citizen Science research projects using varied methods. The results indicated that student interest and participation in the astronomy club greatly increased. The students exhibited positive changes in attitudes and motivation towards how science is done both within and outside of the classroom. They also showed an improvements in skills used during the program.	['research', 'high school students', 'astronomy', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

This project focused on the use of selected Next Generation Science Standards practices; developing and using models, using mathematics and computation thinking, and engaging in argument from evidence to aid in helping them understand biology concepts and in motivating and engaging them. The effects of using these practices on instructor engagement and motivation as well as student's perception of the instructor caring about them were also considered. This project investigated the effects of incorporating the chosen practices as compared to a traditional teacher-centered behaviorist classroom in a general biology course at a moderately sized high school in Wyoming. The effects of incorporating the chosen practices was assessed by comparing two units on the molecular basis of genetics and genetic principles taught using the selected NGSS practices to a traditionally taught unit on bacteria using pre and postintervention assessment data. The initial unit lasted for two weeks, the unit on the molecular basis of genetics lasted for five weeks, and the unit on genetic principles lasted for four weeks. Students completed pre and post intervention target assessments and concept surveys on their perception of understanding. Some students also completed in-depth interviews with the instructor about both the content and the methods of learning. Additional forms of data collection were employed during all three units to determine the effect on student engagement and motivation, including field notes, pre and postintervention nonconcept interviews, and pre and postintervention biology engagement/motivational questionaires. Effects on the instructor's teaching and motivation were determined through the use of field notes, pre and postintervention surveys, and nonintervention and intervention observations by a colleague. The effects on students' perception of instructor caring was assessed using field notes and reflective journaling, pre and postintervention surveys and student quotes from pre and postintervention surveys. The results showed improvement in both student conceptual understanding and student motivation and engagement. Results also showed an improvement in the instructor's engagement and motivation. A review of data regarding the effects of incorporating the selected NGSS practices on students' perception of instructor care for them revealed a lack thereof and the results were inconclusive.

Also the effect of increasing the number of videos per week on students' learning was studied. To accomplish the objectives of the project, the class was divided into three periods: no video period, one video a week period and two videos a week period. The data revealed that students scored higher in the one video period in both teacher-made assessments and weekly online quizzes. Also, increasing the number of the videos to two did not show any increase either in the teacher made neither assessments nor the online quiz result. Overall, students reported positive feedback regarding the flipped classroom approach and the results showed that they preferred it to the no videos period, traditional approach.

The use of science process skills such as observation, communication, measurement, classification, inference, and prediction had not been studied. In order to ensure scientifically appropriate stations in the new exhibit, research into how children use these skills was conducted in the existing Discovery Room. Children were observed and timed during their visit. Guardians of the children were interviewed or surveyed after the visit was completed. Analysis indicated that dynamic stations, such as the Wind Tunnel, enticed children more than static stations, like a wall-sized Memory Game. In order to ensure success in the Discovery Room that will be constructed in 2015, the Discovery Room should feature dynamic stations that engage science process skills such as prediction and inference.

Eight students were the focus of the study on the level of understanding and long-term memory of physics concepts. The study also included student motivation, student engagement, as well as teacher attitude, motivation, preparation time and grading time. Students learned to identify concepts, hierarchically order concepts, and to relate the concepts to each other. The study was done comparing a two-week nontreatment unit on momentum to a two-week treatment unit on periodic motion and a two-week treatment unit on waves. In the treatment units, concept mapping was used interactively and cooperatively with the students in the classroom to show concepts and the relationships between the concepts. Various instruments were used including targeted assessments, student concept interviews, student surveys, colleague observations, and teacher observations were used for assessing the effects of concept mapping. The results of the study were mixed. Data indicated that concept mapping had a positive effect on the student level of understanding, student engagement and on teacher attitude and motivation. For long-term memory of concepts, the treatment unit on periodic motion was better than the nontreatment unit on momentum, but the treatment unit on waves was worse than the nontreatment unit. The effect on student motivation was neutral. The preparation and grading time took longer for the treatment unit, but the preparation was better. I look forward to incorporating concept mapping into my teaching style.	['high school students', 'physics', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

This project was carried out at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha, Nebraska. Local high school juniors and seniors who wish to gain authentic learning experiences may attend high school on zoo grounds in a program called Zoo Academy.Zoo Academy students learn through hands-on activities, shadowing zoo employees, conducting independent studies, and speaking to the community about topics such as conservation. Much of their learning takes place outdoors rather than inside a classroom. Data regarding female students' STEM perceptions and identity was collected through surveys, student and teacher interviews, and the Draw a Scientist test. Analysis of the student interview, student surveys, teacher survey, and Draw a Scientist Test reveals that authentic learning experiences improve female students' perception of science and identity in future STEM careers, hands-on experiences contribute positively to perceptions of STEM, Zoo Academy teachers have a variety of tools at their disposal to create authentic learning experiences for students, and teachers use various strategies to engage both male and female students in STEM. My findings revealed two major takeaways: authentic experiences improve all students' attitude toward learning, regardless of subject; and teaching style has an overwhelmingly strong impact on students' confidence and identity.

Pulling from various proven literacy strategies, I developed a process called Question, Read, Connect, Reflect (QRCR). During the treatment period of four weeks, students worked cooperatively to read five sections of the science textbook. Students started by previewing the text (question), reading the section one heading at a time (read), and using a concept web as a graphic organizer to identify main ideas (connect). The final portion of the process (reflect) had students constructing summaries of the section using the terms from their webs. Students also took time to think back on their participation, effort, and use of new information throughout the QRCR session. QRCR packets, which contained the concept webs and summaries, were analyzed and interviews were given at the end of the treatment. Students were given pre and post-treatment questionnaires to gain insight on students' use of various literacy and textbook skills. Questionnaires and comments on self- reflection forms were also used to track changing attitudes and thoughts on the QRCR process. Findings showed that the majority of the treatment group enjoyed the new reading process. Effort and motivation increased and gains in identification of main ideas as well as organization on concept webs were shown. Despite this, no gains were shown in summarizing skills nor were improvements in writing demonstrated.	['education', 'civilization', 'auxiliary sciences of history', 'literacy', 'general education']

The pre-treatment units incorporated a traditional learning model whereas the treatment units incorporated a flipped learning model during which students completed homework assignments using varied technologies. A mixed-methods design utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data resources was used to answer the research question. The results using qualitative data of this study provided evidence that a flipped learning model using varied technologies verses the traditional model had effects on student attitudes, preferences, homework completion, comprehension and learning, preparedness, interest, motivation, and engagement. This study also found the flipped model as more effective than the traditional model on student attitudes, preferences, interest and motivation, engagement, homework completion, and preparedness with variable effects on student learning and comprehension, and achievement. Student attitudes toward the flipped learning model were in favor of varied technologies to video-lectures alone. It was found that varied technologies, such as WebQuests, virtual labs, tutorials, animations, and interactive videos are more engaging.

As high-stakes testing becomes more prevalent, it has been necessary to begin to look at changing aspects of pedagogy along with assessment to increase achievement. Students were given a survey prior to the treatment/non-treatment cycle and then again when the cycle concluded to detect any change in their attitude once they became more comfortable with the grading system. Students were also given the choice to authentically reflect on their learning and the quality of the reflection was compared to their overall understanding of the materials. Overall students' attitudes about their abilities in relation to the practices with SBG were positive. Students who demonstrated a quality reflection were much more likely to be proficient on the summative assessment when compared to their peers who either did not reflect or completed a poor reflection.

This project used Introductory Station Labs to engage students in a variety of short collaborative investigations prior to the beginning of formal instruction for several units with three high school physics classes. The findings indicate that Introductory Station Labs are helpful by allowing students to make real-world connections, by providing sources of reflection while problem solving later in a unit and by enriching their experience with the world. A positive shift in student interest levels was noted. This study highlights the need to place more emphasis on reflection so that students can better develop the connections required to see the beauty of physics in the world around them.

Each auteur is situated in, and limited by, the ideological frameworks of their time. This makes documentation around sites of trauma problematic. The Johari Window is used as a template to show that cultural blind spots are inevitable. The works of Jean Rouch and Edward Curtis, who documented colonized Africans and colonized American Indians, respectively, are offered as proof that these blind spots show up in our work. Critiques of Rouch and Curtis reveal the auteurs' racism and colonial privilege, despite their seeming enlightened perspectives about the colonized Other. The repetitive return by Rouch and Curtis to victimized and dominated subjects serves as evidence of their own trauma around the human atrocities inflicted by their own social group. Enrichment from colonization does not preclude traumatization, especially when one is witness, but helpless, to end the suffering. With contradictory forces at work in our psychologies, documentary can be an opportunity for intervention and healing or it can reiterate and reinforce the hierarchies that enabled the violence in the first place.

Ulmer's national tuberculosis films of 1939	In the last decade, a number of largely forgotten early 20th century medical science educational films have been located, restored and digitized for academic and public review. I present in this paper one particular series of films written and directed by the Ã©migrÃ© Austrian director, Edgar Ulmer, for the National Tuberculosis Association's campaign of 1939. Set apart from other period mainstream classroom and academic contagion films, Ulmer's series was one of the first to address high contagion, socially marginalized populations through culturally inclusive film narratives. In this paper I will discuss how Ulmer broke with the narrowly accessible teaching conventions and utilized culturally embedded understandings of authority, race, gender and nationalism to motivate minority and at risk communities to comply with public health regulations. I will conclude that his seminal work in adapting medical science for accessible public consumption informs a broad and thereby more effective messaging in public medical media today.

However, the impact of macroscale process conditions on microscale droplet drying and the impact of droplet drying history on SDD physical stability, dissolution performance and particle properties are not well understood. Mass transfer to the droplet surface is diffusion limited, and quantifying the mutual diffusivity over the solvent content and wet-bulb temperatures experienced during drying is crucial to modeling droplet drying. This research used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to probe the concentration and temperature dependence of molecular scale interactions within binary systems of HPMCAS polymer and acetone. This data can be incorporated into SDD droplet drying models. Following the generalized droplet drying model of Handscomb and Kraft [1], a specific SDD modeling procedure was developed. A preliminary form was coded in MATLAB using the finite difference method to approximate the drying time-dependent solvent concentration profiles over the changing droplet radius based on the governing equation for mass conservation. Mixtures of HPMCAS with acetone and wet placebo SDD were tested using high-field NMR. Pulsed gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) NMR experiments resolved self-diffusion of solvent and polymer. Solvent concentration dependence of the mutual diffusivity was related to a free-volume fit of the acetone self-diffusivity. Multidimensional T 1-T 2 correlation and T 2-T 2 exchange experiments separated proton populations based on correlations of spin-lattice T 1 to spin-spin T 2 relaxation times and discerned time-dependent mixing between T 2 populations. T 1 and T 2 relaxation times depend on the mediation of dipolar coupling by rotational motions; therefore these experiments indicate molecular rotational mobility. Temperature dependence of self-diffusivity and T 1-T 2 correlation measured within a rubbery as well as a glassy HPMCAS/acetone sample indicated that these measurements can determine the thermodynamic phase of polymer-solvent systems. Progression of the SDD droplet drying model and the fundamental aspect of the research on polyelectrolyte and polymer dynamics expanded the current knowledge of polymer glass transition behavior, network formation, and aging. This research demonstrates the potential use of NMR to characterize and quantify mobility and mass transfer of polymers and other pharmaceutically-relevant materials.

He found out that the main concern of the early reservation schools was simple survival; in the boarding schools the children's labor assured the needs of physical survival for everyone living on the premises. Has some information about Indian boarding schools and the way they treated their students as well as the emergence of the various day schools on the reservation. Also includes facts about the difficulties Crow students initially faced when trying to attend public schools in and around the reservation. As resources became more abundant, the reservation became less self-sufficient and relied heavily on federal monies to support a wide range of programs in the schools. The teachers focused more on academics, athletics, and programs specifically geared toward Crow students. He has some striking examples of waste within the reservation schools ranging from extremely long field trips and money wasted on athletic endeavors to teachers spending huge amounts of resources on professional improvement in the form of conferences and travel. Bradley also talks about the severe disciplinary problems found in many of the schools during this period. When the availability of resources began to decline in the early 1970s the academic standards were allowed to decline, majority of the Indian programs were dropped, and the focus shifted toward vocational education. Bradley also concluded that many educators were more interested in getting more pay and benefits than being good teachers. Has considerable information about various tribal members who were involved with the Crow school system.	['history']

This studyâs purpose centers on three questions: how do public representatives interpret and define their democratic responsibilities; what are their insights regarding opportunities and barriers in participation-based budgeting; to what extent are these goals met? To address these questions, this research employs a case study of a public university budgeting committee; interviews of committee members were conducted; analyses result in a conceptual map of a participation-based budgeting process. Findings reveal that respondents 1) define their mission structurally and procedurally, 2) identify a need ethical behavior and leadership, and 3) recognize that democratic values such as participation and efficiency come into tension with one another. Being open and inclusive comes in the form of the citizenâpublic administrator dialectic, and it also requires intellectual, ethical and practical engagement with competing democratic values.

The study measured whether treatment (a six-week nutrition program) was more effective than a control (psychotherapy only) group in: (1) decreasing the weekly frequency of binge/purge episodes; (2) increasing nutritional quality of food intake retained; (3) improving body weight and eating attitudes; and (4) maintaining body weight and percentage of body fat in bulimic subjects. Results showed that both the treatment and control groups decreased the frequency of binge/purge episodes in the bulimic patients; however, treatment was not significantly more effective than control. Treatment was significantly more effective than control in the pre- and post-testing of body weight and eating attitudes and in improving the percentages of the Recommended Dietary Allowances for most of the nutrients analyzed. There was no significant difference found for body weight and percentage of body fat between treatment and control groups. It was concluded that nutritional intervention helped to decrease the frequency of binge/purge episodes, changed the highly disturbed attitudes of body weight and eating to a lesser degree, and increased the nutritional quality of dietary intake of bulimic subjects without adversely affecting body weight and percentage of body fat.

The sample consisted of 280 students residing in four dormitories on the Montana State University campus. The subjects were fulltime students and either sophomores, juniors, or seniors. A table of random numbers was used to select the subjects proportionate to the number of students living in each of the four dormitories and proportionate to the sex of the students. Instrumentation included URES, CUES II, and the Campus Architectural Rating Scale (CARS). CARS is a nominal rating scale which differentiated architectural factors that existed between dormitories. Each subject answered the 96-item URES and the 160-item CUES II. In addition, each subject was given a rating on CARS depending on his dormitory of residence. A multiple regression program was used to predict grade point average from a combination of URES scales, CUES II scales, CARS factors, and university computed expected grade point averages. Using these variables, 30.88% of the variance in obtained grade point average was explained at the .01 level. Expected grade point average accounted for 28.55% of the total variance which was explained. The URES scale Independence was the only other variable that significantly increased the prediction efficiency. Of the 70 correlation coefficients which were computed between the 10 URES scales and the 7 CUES II scales, 50 were significant. No CARS factor was significantly related to academic achievement. Only one URES scale, Innovation, was significantly related to academic achievement. Although the relationship between Innovation and academic achievement was significant, it was not sufficient to be useful in predicting academic achievement.

Two-thirds of the acreage is within the reservation. One of the main problems on the reservation is the complex ownership pattern of land due to the original allotment process and the heirship and trust status problems it has caused. This could be simplified through an expanded tribal land purchase program and the encouragement for Indian owner-operators through extensive changes in education, credit, employment, and attitudes. Greater tribal involvement in the Indian administration process would provide both employment and improve tribal organization. Those individuals who are interested in and able to operate farms and ranches should be given easier access to credit. The theses includes a very brief history of the tribe and its customs, a more detailed history of the allotment program and the multitude of problems it has brought through inheritance and the lack of interest majority of the Crow have in working the land themselves which has led to large scale leasing. Many of the Indians who owned their allotments in fee patent, sold them to non-Indians who usually bought those key tracts that contained springs and streams for stock water. This provided the non-Indian owner with control of the surrounding lands which could only be leased to the owner of the key tracts. By 1961 this had led to a situation where non-Indians used 90% of the grazing land and 94% of the cropland within the reservation. Discusses some of the abuses commonly present in the leasing process.	['irrigation']

The purpose of this study was to examine critically the educational Indian missions in the colonial colleges. In doing so, this investigation employed ethnohistorical perspectives and methodology in examining the institutional experiments at Henrico, Virginia, Harvard College, the College of William and Mary, and Dartmouth College, spanning a period from the early seventeenth to the late eighteenth centuries. The study found that, while the colonial educators professed their own piety as if this were their singular motivation, they capitalized on the charitable impulses of the pious English and on the opportunities which the charity presented in furthering other political and economic interests. This investigation also established that mixed motives led to diversions from the purposes for which money had been collected and further that this was a primary cause of the ultimate failure of these/ educational experiments. In revealing that missions in the colonial colleges were not expressions of unblemished piety, this study has confronted the declarations espoused in the early records and much of the later historical literature, thus enhancing the growing body of ethnohistorical scholarship on Indian-white relations during the colonial period, while simultaneously offering a fresh insight into the origins of higher education in America.

The project is in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Art at Montana State College at Bozeman, Montana. The memorial is to Max P. Kuhr, civic leader, lawyer, and member of the Northern Montana College executive board, who was killed in an automobile accident near Havre. His family and many friends established a fund to be used to enhance the campus. This fund was used to develop the memorial. The reservoir functions as a storage unit for water pumped from the deep wells on campus for irrigation purposes. Size was dictated by volume requirements for irrigation, while retaining depth not exceeding safety margins for children. The shape of the reservoir-pool developed out of the existing form of the land on which it was placed. The total project evolved as a unit which embodies the theme of the ""Watering Hole,"" through the sculptural development of indigenous forms of the region. A fountain symbolically conveys the growth and use factors of water in this region while functioning as an outlet for the water from the wells. A free standing wall with abutments functions as the base for sculpture while housing the valve and pumping equipment necessary for irrigation. The indigenous animal forms developed in sheet steel surmount the wall and abutments. Included in this thesis are photographs of the area, the wall, the fountain, the pool-reservoir, the animal forms, and models of the project."

In the last five years, of that time, I have been able to isolate, in my works some of the inklings that were inside me and to make explicit to myself (and to others) what I was capable of. I had freed myself somewhat from external authority and was able to grapple with some of the internal absurdities that make working worthwhile. Whether the works are in fashion or not, I found is completely beside the point. I found also that the critical authority is often trapped behind the word ""aesthetic"" and that posterity can sometimes be a liar. I realized that what once had been in me an enormous responsibility to ""BE A SCULPTOR"" had changed in that five years to an inward responsibility to simply do my own work. I can look, back and see that my early work reveals an awareness of becoming, and now, it seems fair to note, my present work is an awareness of being."

This doesn't mean I ignore what green, does. I'm concerned with color, shape and surface, but my main concern is that a spirit or mood or attitude comes through. The most, important quality in art, to me, is the strength of the artist's personal imagery or viewpoint.

70036	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/6259	Truth in exploration	"Specifically, I purposefully accepted the notion that life is not a series of stand alone tableaus or scenes as in a roll of film, but rather that life is a continuum of interrelated elements in which the action is a composite of ever moving time, geography, emotions, reactions, and viewpoints. In the art of painting, then, life cannot be ""stop actioned"" as in the Renaissance ""window"" approach, or by multi viewpointing a stopped action as in the Cubist approach. Nor can life be painted by abstracting an emotional response to an event without visual reference to the geographical and temporal relationships which comprise elements of it. Emotion interpreted without visual reference to the event giving rise to it or to the time frames (plural) comprising this experience is too ambiguous for me. It is the filtering of truth rather than providing a whole revelation. To depict an event the painter must give visual substance to all the elements and show their interrelationships including the artists own participation in it. Thus a faithful depiction is a conglomeration of all the nuances of information experienced and interpreted by the participant/observer artist. I seek a recordation in meaningful form of the subtle interrelationships involved in a total experience: emotionally, temporally, and geographically. My free play of color introduces emotional responses into the abstract so that they can be depicted with reference to each other element making up the whole. The color forms also allowed me to visually highlight different elements both in a geographic and temporal sense. Finally, free play allows the depiction of contradictions in and among all the elements, particularly when using intense color combinations."

70037	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/6570	Painted constructions	I am currently working on small painted constructions. When I first started this body of work, I used found objects as a basis for forming each piece. The objects were transformed from junk into representations of various medals of honor. Since then the emphasis has changed from a sentimental attachment to the object into a more integrated construction of form, texture, and color. The pieces consist of a variety of found objects that provide a foundation for ideas and solutions within the pieces. The objects are appropriately arranged and visually transformed by the addition of the painted surface. When constructing a two-dimensional relief surface it is apparent to me that the paint must be a rich and integral part of the piece or be overpowered by the found object. I use the paint to enhance, respond to, or imitate the physical, tactile and inherent color qualities natural to found objects. In effect, the paint must become object-like. The pieces focus on the tension between the actual object on the surface and the illusion created by the painted shapes. This encounter between the physical reality of the objects and the painted illusion of form and space becomes the crux of my pieces. The objects I choose lend themselves to a small format because the paint can more easily transform the scale of the objects. As I work, idea's for pieces occur simultaneously. I take advantage of these ideas by working on many pieces at once. The immediacy of the small scale allows for manipulation and experimentation. As I paint on a construction I often hold it in my lap. I enjoy the feeling of the entire construction becoming an object. I want the viewer to be as involved in comprehending the pieces as I was in making, them. I want my work to engage the viewer through the recognition of the illusion versus object, a fascination with surface, a response to the colors, and by identification of the objects. My paintings may appear one way at first glance, then as the viewer is drawn close I hope his perception will change. Ideally the viewer will become aware of the deception and the reality of the construction.

It is important to bear in mind that the Birth Series deals with the theme of birth in universal terms. The theme of birth is developed also with experimentation in mind by integrating new shapes with traditionally symbolic ones in an arrangement which is very often highly personal, ambiguously playful, and still manipulated and orchestrated with enough interest, I feel, to allow the viewer to engage in a personal discourse with the work regardless of what my specific intentions behind each piece were at the time of conception. Some of the work, for instance, deals with my personal vision of the human figure in the landscape, and the landscape as a metaphor for the human figure, carrier of life, as in Birth Series Nos. 3, 4, 20, and 11. It deals also with, the observation of metamorphoses which occur during the life forming process in nature, and which reveal themselves in terms of changing shapes and colors. Some of the images are linked to natural things (""seed"", ""water"") as in Birth Series Nos. 7, 11, 13, and 15 as well as to visual-linguistic forms (""lozenge"", ""circles""), as in Birth Series Nos. 9 and 10. My creative expression evolves with images and compositional dynamics the way blues lyrics evolve in vivid objective correlatives. As in blues and later forms of jazz, I am concerned with rendition (mimesis) and experimentation. Shapes are like musical, poetic verses to me. One form inspires a whole trend of thoughts, thoughts based on what I am, what I know, and what I believe in."

The pieces Included In this exhibition demonstrate two distinct, yet closely related, types of structural forms: the tenuous and the stable. Both of these forms have been used to activate or animate my sculptures. The tenuous pieces possess an excited state with the potential of energy release. The focal point of these structures Is the element within the piece that creates the force or resistance against the material. I relate to this aspect of my sculptures on a sensual level where the process of building and conceiving the idea Is experienced through manipulation and construction of the material. This Is an embodiment of my physical energy and Is reflected through their tense gestures. In the stable structural forms the material Is not stressed; rather, the focal point is the idea of support, emphasizing the element which rests on top. These pieces represent stability and permanence and are the antithesis of tenuousness. I relate to them as the structures that support my intellectual and rational energies. Together the sculptures achieve a balance of separate aspects of my working process. For me sculpture Is most successful when it achieves that balance within itself.

70040	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/6578	Paintings	I grew up in an environment where the winters are without daylight and the summers are without darkness. My paintings reflect the contrast between light and dark, which I still associate with the changing of the seasons in Northern Norway. My color choices are influenced by this change and its effect on my state of mind. The darker colors , which I use more frequently during winter, have a heaviness relieved by bright hues, while paintings utilizing overall higher values, balance playfull darker tones. The world I am painting is one based on an imaginative interpretation of nature being transformed into a world caught between dreams and reality. I collect information about nature by painting outdoors. This information shares significance with memories of real and dreamed landscapes. Nature acts as a source on two levels; providing direct images described in the paintings and providing influence from natural phenomena like seasonal changes and cycles of death and rebirth. The paintings become a personal expression of my experiences of these pehnomena. Ultimately the work is not about nature in a literal or descriptive sense, but a metaphorical or spiritual way. Nature images described as themselves can be seen in a literal way. Yet because they have been used historically, they also are a universal symbolic language. This allows for the possibility of a visual statement which transcends the obvious literal meaning. The leaves, plants, stars, moon and sun which make up the iconography of my work are important to me, because of their everlasting cycle of death and rebirth, and because of their importance through the history of symbols. In Chinese symbolism, for example, a single leaf is an allegory of happiness, while several leaves appearing together represent people, and plants are an image of life and spirituality. Although I am aware of the symbolic language of the iconography I use, I choose these images because of their personal importance to me.

70042	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/6582	Monuments	My work with pottery as subject matter has led me to become involved with placing pots in visual, historical, and architectural contexts. The tall, slender stacks of pottery forms put pots into an architectural context by implication. The work refers to towers, columns, pilasters. By most ceramic standards, these towers are quite large, stacking to heights between six and twelve feet. The significance of scale and the emphasis of repetition make this work a monument to pottery. The repetition of forms within each column encourages manipulation of the perception of those forms. The pot forms may be individually examined, compound forms created by the interact ion of parts of two or more units may be discovered, and the silhouette of the combined forms may be read as a single shape. Some of the compound forms were deliberately pursued. I searched for a vase shape that when repeated yielded a compound form like the body of a violin . Many of the towers are banded with colored slips and glazes. The stripes are an articulate way to describe the real or iIlusionistic volume of the forms without unduly distracting at tent ion from those forms. These horizontal bands also assist in further segmentation of the columns. The stripes are stacked, too. The color of the bands may be used to stress different ways of perceiving the units which compose the columns, Or facilitate blending those units into one flowing shape. For me, color has content. Some surfaces refer to water, or a certain quality of light.

70043	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/6600	Moods, attitudes, and erections	My art is the manifestation of a unique, personal, obsessive vision and is the embodiment of intense emotion. Committed to my own vision and freedom, I have a fierce need for personal expression. My creative process is initiated by automatic drawing, however, the intensely personal nature of my work soon transforms these spontaneous images into a personal story or narrative. These narratives make autobiographical references and visualize personal experiences, dreams, and emotional responses. I utilize random juxtapositions to create enigmatic compositions containing violence, sexual allusions, and psychic crises. In my daily life, I expose only that part of myself that I want others to see, repressing my more ambitious, erotic, and aggressive desires. However, the id rebels against the censorship of the superego in my art allowing full expression of my fantasies. There are several predominant aspects of my true character which reveal themselves in my work. First, I visualize myself as a victim-hero in a dangerous and senseless world gone out of control. I have no power over the world and can only live with personal virtue and be self reliant. Consequently, I often deal with the darker side of the psyche, my own as well as that of others. Secondly, I have many erotic thoughts which exist in the realms of both fantasy and reality. My thoughts range from fears of impotence, castration, embarrassment, and rejection to the pride of extreme prowess and virility. A third major aspect of my work concerns pain and death.

After that ""nothing happened - we just lived"" according to Chief Two Leggins. According to Mr. Bradley, however, a lot of things happened. Ratification of the Agreement of 1880 in 1882 began the policy of selling Crow land for money to run the remaining reservation. During the latter part of the 19th century the Crows had been taught how to plow fields, run cattle, and dig ditches. No effort was made to teach them land management and economics, which caused significant difficulties when the Indians eventually wanted to govern themselves. During this period the white Indian agents had the power. They kept the Crows from visiting other reservations in the 1880s and 1890s. The most important issues from the government viewpoint at this time included: leasing tribal lands, granting right of ways to railroads, authorizing irrigation construction, and establishing schools. The irrigation work was the first large scale employment opportunity to the Crows. T This thesis deals with the history of the Crows between 1880 and 1920s - a period of major transition. It is based on nearly 2000 letters received by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs concerning the Crow reservation. The major issues concerning the Crow reservation were: leasing tribal lands, ceding lands, the irrigation of the land inside the reservation boundaries, and establishment of schools. First cattle herds were driven into Montana in 1866. By 1882 stockmen were clamoring to use the reservation lands for grazing. At first the Indians were allowed to choose the lessees, but by 1887 the Department of the Interior decided to regulate the process by leasing to the highest bidder on the lands the Indians chose to lease. The Crow disliked the system, wanting to grant the leases to people who treated them fairly. This often led to disputes between the Indians and the agent. Many of the leases were contingent on the lessees buying all Crow surplus hay. The Northern Pacific railroad survey party reached the Crow reservation in 1880. The Crows gave consent to it in 1881. In 1887 they allowed a branch line to be built to Red Lodge. However, the negative effects - such as more whites inside the reservation, cattlemen driving their herds to nearest shipping point, and liquor available in towns near reservation boundaries made the Crows rethink the advantages of railroads. They withheld further consent, but this was made irrelevant by the government deciding such consent was no longer needed. The government began the planning of irrigation ditches on the reservation in 1884. To make the Crows agree with the plans the majority of the work was to be done by the Indians. The irrigation work brought employment, money and gambling to the reservation. Once the canals were finished, though, the trained workforce was left idle. The Crows seemed to accept the idea of allotments until Sitting Bull's visit, which turned them against it. From then on they were generally against the idea of individual ownership of land. It was nearly impossible for them to hang onto their allotments among white people on the lands the tribe ceded to the government. Whites commonly caused trouble by relinquishing, leasing, or squatting on these allotments. The Crows eventually came to realize that the government would sell whatever land was left over after allotments had been granted. With the increased pressure from the white settlers to open the reservation, the government started to backpedal on such issues as the necessity of Crow consent to selling the Crow lands. Because the Indians had been declared ""government wards"" in 1903, such consent was unnecessary if the government acted in the best interest of the Indians. The Crows vehemently opposed such attitudes. To counter such actions, the Crows suggested using their ""educated young men"" to make sense of the various propositions. New bills to open the remainder of the reservation were introduced to congress in 1907, 1910, 1915, and 1918. The Crow Act, largely written by the tribe itself, finally passed in 1920 ending 15 years of political haggling. The Act divided the entire reservation under individual ownership by tribal members. Government opened the first school on the reservation in 1883 in Crow Agency. This was followed by Catholic and Unitarian boarding schools. Some students were sent to off-reservation schools despite an earlier agreement with the government. The students were taught basic academics and a variety of ""industrial"" skills. The main focus was converting the children to white man's culture."	['history']

Most myths act as social commentary: a type of oral and written tradition which imparts a methodology of making life traditions. My role as artist functions somewhat as commentator and critic. The personal commentary I address ranges from male/female issues to social issues. The sources of information that I use for my work vary; being inspired by nature, and provoked by personal, political, and social actions. What I do is describe a network of relationships among forms; organic, architectural, and figurative, attempting to reveal the connection between form and issue. The work deals with the ideas of life and balance; life on the edge, and life in harmony. Working within this emotionally charged context with the theme of rebirth and regeneration, certain images have emerged. These forms are rooted in my past and project symbolic meaning. Houseforms are indicative of home and homeland, and sticks, stones, eggs, and whirling tops are the basic building blocks of youthful imagination exploring nature. Architectural elements are symbolic of culture, knowledge, and societal concerns. In unison with the figure, these elements make a somewhat cryptic and enigmatic attempt at narrative; creating truths or events that will hopefully transcend their personal revelation into the mystery of my place within the larger world.

Clay reinforces my imagery and content of landscape and figures because clay is earth; when it is fired it becomes rock. The brittle unevenness of the surface, the colors, the cracks, the dents, the holes represent human vulnerabilities, frailties, imperfections, their humanness, their perserverance, their impermanence. I alter the clay body to make the clay surface look similar to a slice of land with veins of color running through it. My firing process furthers the geological nature of my sculptures. The clay is underfired and unevenly fired resulting in further color variations on the surface. Clay cracks as it dries. These cracks add to the natural land image and reinforce my content. I build in supports on either side of where I want a crack, cut the clay on the inner sides and let the shrinkage do the rest of the cutting. Clay lends itself to texture.

She believed that this could be either helped or made worse by the way reading is taught. She wanted to find out what was lacking in their social environment. To gain answers she did an extensive literature review combined with empirical evidence from first graders in Crow schools. She concluded that language competency (how well the child was able to speak) was an important prerequisite for learning to read. Many of the Crow students had not reached the sufficient level of language proficiency, thus encountered trouble when trying to learn to read. Some of the recommendations from the study include: parents should read to their children from infancy, using their primary language (if they are bilingual). The books should be in their native language in the beginning, once the child reaches the age of 3 he should start listening to stories written in English.

The images I use represent personal symbols and interact, sometimes with long sweeping amorphous shapes and spherical masses. My color is intuitive and often muted. My art alludes to a darkened inner-world space. Although dark, this place is not still. Images spin and collide. Energy is wound in coils of paint and surface markings. A visible struggle occurs when combining these images, which exude such different energy and directional forces. This provides an ambivalent and turbulent relation to space. These images appear to want to break out of the limitations of the surface and framework.

The form is the transformation of fabric, both woven and lace, into functional jewelry made from bronze and sterling silver. My intent is to translate the idea of soft, pliable fabric into metal, and create the illusion of fabric. This idea is especially important with the silver lace pieces. The sterling silver pins and necklace of lace embossed metal are translations of several elements. The layers of metal are copies of stiff white lace collars found in fifteenth and sixteenth century paintings. Flat pieces of sterling silver are folded and pinched into tight gathers to create the impression of a ruffle. Several layers of metal are attached to resemble the fullness of the lace collars. The diffusion of reflective light and the negative spaces create an illusion of increased visual depth. The white matte color of the silver provides a strong contrast to the dark area of negative space. The process of leaving silver white imitates the starched lace and stiff doilies used by my grandmothers. The Norwegian women who immigrated to the United States brought only their clothing and jewelry; my grandmother was one. Her most treasured pieces of jewelry were her Norwegian pins of filigree framework, with silver and gold disks. As a child I was fascinated by how elaborate and beautiful they were. Even though my works look nothing like these pins, they have been a strong influence, both visually and emotionally.

Parents of randomly selected third grade children completed the HOMES questionnaire to determine the musical experience of their children. Language achievement was determined by the CTBS scores in mechanical language, expressive language, reading, and spelling. Gender was also of interest in this study; therefore a two-way analysis of variance test was used with gender and musical experience being the two independent variables and one of the four language scores being the dependent variable. The test was run four times, once for each dependent variable. A chi-square test was also run to determine if either gender was given significantly more musical experience. Three hypotheses were tested for each language skill. No interaction of independent variables existed for any of the dependent variables, so main effects were tested for each. The high group for musical experience also was found to be significantly higher in language achievement for the skills of expressive language, reading, and spelling. Only mechanical language showed no such relationship. It was also the only skill area that did show a significant relationship to gender, with girls being higher. The chi-square test showed that girls received significantly more musical experience than boys. Because a strong relationship was found to exist between music and three areas of language development, it was recommended that parents, teachers, and other caretakers of young children provide environments rich in musical experience. Additionally, further research should be performed to determine which particular types of musical experience have the strongest relationship to language development.

Party cakes, especially, represent an excessive consumption at luxurious, festive gatherings. In a larger context, the cakes allude to a delirious atmosphere paralleling the vacant mentality promoted by the mass media in our culture. I direct this criticism through my work by creating the cakes with ""flavors"" - specific popular belief systems that ""decorate"" the cakes with satirical commentary. Thus, the super-saturated tiered cake with candle-crown and banner embodies the superficial idealization of a pageant queen. Because their hats are alike, the Pope and a Klansman share a cake in an uncomfortable stasis of competing ideologies. The decorative dome atop the Capitol transforms into a hovering U.F.O., suggesting a recent or imminent invasion. The humor in my work serves as an important vehicle for conveying more serious ideas. I question peoples' blind reliance on established beliefs and obsolescent attitudes. My scope ranges from ancient religious adoration to the deification of certain contemporary institutions.

The records of students' test responses and of their discourse related to the specific mathematical content of the course were analyzed in order to infer the types of mathematical meanings that the students were capable of assigning to the algebraic topics under study. Transcripts of classroom lectures were analyzed to determine the levels of mathematical conceptualization of the subject matter that was presented to the students. This information was used to assess the effectiveness of the particular classroom learning environment and to provide recommendations for the development of a model of effective classroom learning. A group of students in the first class were found to utilize a type of classificatory recognition system that allowed them to correctly manipulate algebraic symbols through rote memorization or by referencing master examples. The students in the second class were more capable of producing mathematically correct work than the first group of students but were not able to develop an appropriate level of mathematical conceptualization for ideas associated with algebraic equations. A model of classroom algebra learning was developed that postulates the following guidelines for effective classroom learning and instruction. It is necessary to (1) identify the levels of mathematical conceptualization of the intended subject matter, (2) provide an appropriate instructional match between the existing levels of the students' mathematical knowledge and the objects of study, and (3) use guided instructional activities that promote the active participation of the students in the learning environment. A model of participatory learning and a mathematical analysis of the learning structure of algebra were developed to address the implementation of the above guidelines.

The assembly sequences were defined via analytical methods and verified later with a physical simu I at ion. The analytical methods used to define the sequences were the SPT rule, the LPT rule and the Branch and Bound algorithm. The software control methods were a single task execution program, and a multitask execution program. The single task execution programs performed all the activities in a sequencial mode. The multitask execution program allowed two activities to run simultaneously. The physical simulation was performed in a robotic cell containing two TeachMover robot arms, a central assembly area, and two bin cells built with Fischertechnik components. The part assembled was a representation of a circuit board with four microchips made of machinable wax. The control software was coded using ARMBASIC for the robot arms and TurboBASIC for the main program. The analytical results showed that using a single robot, the sequence with the best completion time was generated with the Branch and Bound algorithm. Also, this result was verified with the physical simulation that generated the best completion time using the Branch and Bound algorithm. Using two robot arms, the analytical results showed that the Branch and Bound algorithm under a multitask execution mode generated the best assembly sequence. In this case, the physical simulation showed different results. The best sequence found with the physical simulation was an adjusted sequence, running under a multitask execution mode, that removed the physical conflicts to avoid collisions in the assembly area. The physical interference could not be observed by the analytical methods. Therefore, the use of physical simulation to evaluate robotic motions is recommended.	['robotics']

The Canfield Learning Style Inventory was administered to 693 students. A one-way analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in achievement depending on learning style in each of eight subject areas of Liberal Arts, Science, Mathematics, Business, Vocational, Native American Studies, Developmental, and Physical Education. Tukey a priori post tests were performed on all significant differences. Significant differences at the .05 level were found in all eight subject areas. A total of 39 significant differences were found. These differences suggest that learning styles contribute to the success of the Native American student in all subject areas. Native American students should be made aware of learning style strengths, and should receive counseling on learning strategies. Instructors should use a variety of teaching methods. Overall conclusions suggest that since most students can learn, changes need to be made to teaching-learning methods, grading, and staff development. Areas for further research include similar studies with other ethnic and age populations, replication using larger samples in mathematics and science, and use of results along with learning strategies to counsel students to see if such counseling would produce better achievement.

My artistic vision resides neither in an optimistic or pessimistic point of view; rather, it is rooted in the belief that one is held in limbo, suspended between two points of reference. The extremes of history and the future, bridged by nothing more than oneâs continually evolving existence, have the potential to act as obstacles to oneâs reality. I have found myself at an immediate proximity to reality. The significance of the creative act is found in the resulting object which satisfies the desire to establish an equilibrium between history and the future. The diverse processes and materials incorporated within my work play a vital role in exploring peculiar circumstances which are a part of my reality. The use of geometry, painted passages and objects creates a dynamic dialogue. This dialogue acts as a means of linking together contrasting elements found within the paintings. The four paintings ""Light,"" ""Breathing,"" ""Thought,"" and ""Pulse Mechanism,"" utilize geometry and physical objects to establish the mechanics of a theoretical machine. The tar covered gear system of ""Light Mechanism,"" and the tar covered bicycle wheel of ""Breathing Mechanism"" are metaphorical symbols for movement within these mechanisms. The plausibility of these works is dependent upon the integrity of particular elements working together to create a theoretical machine."

It is little realized that travel on the Yellowstone River, from the days of the fur-trader to the coming of the railroad, played a very significant part in the history of the region. The Yellowstone was important first in exploration, and then in the fur trade, and finally was the decisive factor in the ability of the United States Army to open up one of the last remaining areas in the Northwest for settlement and peaceful pursuits.

Whenâthese experiences are multiplied by the number of people who have felt them, they affect the world as a whole as we pass them along generation to generation. My personal role as an artist is to use the three dimensional presence of sculpture to communicate these experiences to the viewer. Use of the figure is important to me because it provides the viewer with access to the work and changes the question from ""What is it?"" to ""What is this about?"". The figure draws the viewer in, and with the addition of other visual clues, such as broken glass or cast objects, forms the composite story. The viewers are then able to form associations with the work through references to their own experience."

From Anasazi kivas to Gothic cathedrals, man has built an environment to suit his spiritual needs. For a lot of people, the ancient traditions are still a powerful source of inspiration, but for some, although still valuable, they lack a modern perspective. Joseph Campbell, an expert on mythology, said, ""We in the West have named our God; or rather, we have had the godhead named for us in a book from a time and place that are not our own."" In my sanctuary I am attempting to create a space for our own time, based on what I perceive our needs to be. In this sanctuary, the accent is on experience, attained by active exploration of the space. Joseph Campbell said people need to seek out their ""own experience: not [have] faith in someone elseâs."" This sanctuary requires the participant to physically search the space with a small flashlight for objects, textures and images that allude to the mystery of life on earth, and beyond. The limited length of the flashlight beam demands a closer scrutiny of the space and increases the intimacy within the structure. One cannot merely shuffle along a traditional museum wall and view the area. Our culture has transformed us into passive viewers and insatiable consumers. We watch television, listen to the radio, watch sports with religious devotion, and passively glide through galleries and museums, consuming information, but gaining no experience. However, in this environment, the idea of the traditional viewer is obsolete."

70062	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/7368	Hybrid symbolism	I use the images of tools because they are versatile and visually interesting. An object such as a hammer, saw, or wrench is interesting not only because of its own formal elements, but also because these familiar forms clearly allude to other things such as human figures, weapons, vehicles, or animals. For example, in my canoe sculpture, I construct an object that is identifiable as both a wrench and a snake. By combining formal elements in this way, I create a hybrid meaning that presents a new symbolism to the viewer. My vocabulary consists of religious icons that I have retrieved from my past. Raised in a devoutly religious household, I have a firm knowledge of numerous biblical images and stories. These images have such historical significance and symbolism that when altered they do not lose their meaning, but rather create a hybrid meaning. For example, in âTunnel,â in order to emphasize the peculiar relationship between luck and religion, I juxtapose religious symbols with symbols of luck. I find luck to be an interesting concept especially in relation to religion. I created a new religious icon by combining the religious acronym âINRI,â with the image of the four leafed clover. The position of the symbols on top of a ladder is not only difficult or seemingly dangerous to reach, but also implies the involuntary use of a tool, in this case the shovel, if the ladder is used.

70064	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/7373	Stories	I use imagery and scale that is toylike. This focuses the viewer on the story and invites a special intimacy with the piece. When a viewer pulls the ring articulating a sculpture or laughs at the playful nature of a composition, that viewer is no longer merely an observer. The sculpture âSaint Behind the Glass,â the patron saint of metalsmiths, metalworkers, artisans and craftsmen is a composition expressing my gratitude after three years of study and asking for a blessing as I go forward. Each person who pulls the ring is blessed. Being a metalsmith influences the scale and sense of preciousness in my work. From this training I am accustomed to working small and using select materials. In accenting my work I like to explore the concept of value by mixing materials such as silver and semiprecious stones with objects having sentimental value, i.e. china doll pieces, pet tags or master links from a motorcycle. I use carvings to bring the parts together and make the sculpture whole. Apollinaire called assemblage sculpture a visual poetry, but I feel compelled to add words, to make my visual poem a ballad. The text is used to complement the sculpture rather than explain it.

Transformed from an idealistic missionary into a immigrant locator and pioneer real estate developer, Andrew's colonization attempts were choreographed by his family's heritage, and complicated by a lifestyle that created illusions of grandeur. Andrew attempted to secure a place in America's upper class by creating a personal fortune from his development schemes in Montana, but he failed to achieve his goals when he disregarded the economic and environmental realities of the frontier. Andrew's failed development schemes, however, are turned into a success when his dream of empire is redefined as a lasting imprint on the human and physical landscape of the Intermountain West. My research of Andrew Wormser's life and entrepreneurial activities consisted of an analysis of archival material, government documents, primary and secondary sources, personal interviews, and on site visits to Wormser City and Big Timber, Montana, and Wenatchee, Washington. The Montana Historical Society Library; Merrill G. Burlingame Special Collections at Montana State University, Bozeman; Hope College Archives and the Heritage Collection, Holland, MI; and Heritage Hall and Colonial Origins Collection of the Christian Reformed Church, Calvin College, Grand Rapids, MI, proved very valuable to my research. My study brought to light how Andrew's life and career was a microcosm of Dutch American history, and that he followed the leadership role of influential religious and civil leaders within the Dutch community of his day. The paper also challenges a Frontier Myth that insists that life in the West promotes progress, success and opportunity all leading to economic gain. Andrew Wormser's life, while sharing some of the accepted components of the Myth, actually suggests a variant of the Frontier Myth that promotes a stronger character, and accepts a spiritual wealth gained from survival within the framework of trial and error. Along with spiritual wealth, a key ingredient of a revised myth is the realization and acceptance of environmental limitations that make up the arid Intermountain West.	['persons', 'immigrants']

These works are the physical manifestation of a personal aesthetic which promotes looking at the past to reflect on contemporary society. These works do not have any concrete message or meaning but are loaded with a number of possibilities which usually allow the spectator to arrive at some conclusion. In order to stage the most interesting set of possibilities I use devices like paradox and irony. These devices seem to form the core of many religions and forms of mysticism because they attempt to explain the unknowable (knowledge of God, life after death, etc.) with the spectacular and impossible. The best examples of this are from Christianity: Christ is dead but alive in everyone, his mother was a virgin but gave birth.

As a result, when I think of family members, it is not of their physical characteristics but of the stories that are told by them and about them. This series of sculptures and drawings are portraits in which the characteristics of the persons represented are constructed out of events in their lives, rather than from their physical attributes. These works recount both my earliest and most recent memories. I begin each sculpture by creating a symbol intended to represent a family member. This symbol is derived from a long process of researching the subjectâs background (place of birth, important experiences, etc.). This information is condensed into a form, often a common object, which I feel fully summarizes the life of the subject. In a sense, the created symbol is like an advertising logo for the subject, an icon that gives the viewer a visual depiction of the essence of the subject. Advertising logos have in fact influenced my approach to the extent that some of the symbols used are adaptations from actual logos. For example, the eyes on the piece ""Myra"" are taken from the CBS television logo. Once the symbol is realized, I construct it into an object. The surface of this object is then covered with a language of other symbols and patterns which both elaborate and further describe the story of this person. The patterns on the sculptures act both as a visual ground to hold the symbols in place and as a descriptive backdrop. The descriptive function of the pattern is one which reiterates the theme of the piece, or one which describes a more specific aspect of the subject. For example, the pattern of cascading lines on the sculpture, ""Myra"" form the name Myra written over and over again. These lines are fragmented into shapes which represent droplets of water, and these in turn, relate to the overall form of the sculpture, a watering can. In ""House of Fire"" a work about my paternal grandfather, a maze-like pattern on one side of the work surrounds icons depicting significant concerns of his. The framework connecting these symbols represents the ambivalence that my grandfather brought into the events of his life."

This idea eventually developed into an ideology and translated into southern white fears of miscegenation. This thesis examines the medium of popular literature and its influence on this ideological development in southern culture. Two southern authors wrote prolifically about miscegenation: Thomas Dixon, whose writings exacerbated white fears, and William Faulkner, whose writings exposed those fears as a negative underpinning of southern culture. My study is not exclusive to literary theory; it combines historical and literary analyses to show how an ideology affected southern culture. I focus on Dixon's writings from 1903 to 1912 and Faulkner's from 1931 to 1936 and argue that both authors accurately captured the fears' effects. A bulk of my study concentrates on Mississippi; however, it devotes portions to Dixon's native North Carolina and the South as a whole. My major objective is to analyze the evolution of miscegenation from idea to ideology: how white southern culture perceived miscegenation and how fears of miscegenation endured and changed, if they changed at all."

Although this model has been used in numerous investigations to examine how people change single health behaviors, few researchers have used this model to investigate the change process when multiple behaviors are involved. The purpose of this study was to determine if the stages of exercise adoption were associated with other health behaviors. The health behaviors included in this study were cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, seat belt nonuse, alcohol use, and nonregular use of stress management practices. The researcher hypothesized that respondents in the later stages of exercise adoption would practice more healthful behaviors than respondents in the earlier stages. Survey research was conducted, using a sample of 1,896 university employees, to obtain the demographic, socioeconomic and behavioral information used in this study. The survey response rate was 68%. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if stage of exercise predicted the presence of each of the health behaviors while controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and other health behavior variables. Respondents in the later stages of exercise adoption were less likely to be cigarette smokers, more likely to use their seat belt regularly, and more likely to use regular stress management practices than respondents in the earliest stage of exercise. Hence, encouraging individuals to become more involved in exercise could indirectly influence other lifestyle behaviors. Exercise has been found to have therapeutic effects in relation to a variety of chronic diseases and could be a possible ""gateway"" behavior towards healthier lifestyle choices."

C. E., Thales emerged as Greece's first philosopher. After Thales came Anixamander and Anaximenes of Miletus, Xenophanes of Colophon, and Heraclitus of Ephesus. As a group, these philosophers are the Ionian Presocratics. In Early Greek Thought and the Orient. M. L. West showed similarities between early Greek philosophy and Near Eastern religious ideas. But Westâs work is not widely accepted. It also raised more questions than it answered. How were Near Eastern ideas transmitted to Ionia? How do they fit into Near Eastern concepts? How was Ionia different from the rest of the Greek world? Strong Near Eastern influence on Ionian Presocratic philosophy must have come from consistent contact with the Near East. Similarities in the ideas of different cultures are not evidence of a transmission of ideas: all that this shows are parallels. To go beyond parallels requires pinpointing the routes of transfer. The Archaic ivory carver is singled out as a medium of transfer for religious ideas. Ivory carvers had a knowledge of both Near Eastern and Greek religion. As ivory carvers traveled throughout the religious centers of the Aegean, they spread Near Eastern religious ideas to Greece. The transfer of the Phoenician alphabet to Greece demonstrates a transfer of ideas. The transfer of the alphabet shows both that there was an intimate level of contact between Greeks and Phoenicians, and that the two peoples communicated complex knowledge effectively, Ionia's cultural and political context exposed it to Near Eastern ideas. The author argues that Ionia adopted Anatolian religion, making it religiously part of the Near East. Ionia's elite families inter-married with the Lydian aristocracy thus closely connecting Ionia to Lydia. Also, political conquest by Lydia and Persia opened Ionia to Anatolian and Iranian culture. Near Eastern influence on Ionian Presocratics demonstrates that Greeks and people of the Near East communicated complex ideas. Transmission of Near Eastern ideas to Greece provides compelling proof that the foundations of Ionian Presocratic philosophy are Near Eastern.	['religion']

My thesis installation âLife Cycleâ portrays the complex relationship between the cycles of nature and the material realities of an industrialized society. Although this is presented primarily as an antagonistic or parasitic relationship, there are also suggestions of a strange symbiosis, often explored through symbols from a variety of ancient belief systems. The sculptural installation has the structure of a natural and spiritual cycle that has a directional flow. The visual metaphors have multiple meanings and are used to refer to the three most significant stages of metaphysical being: birth, sexual union and death. The construction of the installation takes on the form of a mechanical simulacrum of the cycle between these three stages. By mechanically simulating life and its potential spiritual progress, I am questioning the validity and feasibility of spirituality by suggesting that spiritual progress may be likened to industrial progress, which is shown as a deterioration rather than a progression toward renewal and liberation. The individual forms in the installation are based on archetypal symbols, some derived from various mythological sources (lotus, serpent), and others based on direct contemporary experience (tubing, metallic surfaces, cartoon-like figures).

It is a field where neglected cultivation melds into untamed ditches and brambles. It is here that the artificial commingles with the natural to create new forms and environments. All human making is a transformation of the natural world. The sculptures in this exhibition are the result of my interest in physically manipulating natural materials to create forms that retain and reflect the intrinsic qualities of the organic and the artificial. My intent with this work is to create forms that seem to span both the natural and manmade worlds.

The agricultural sector continues to outpace other industries in Montana. Cattle and calf production are 50% of Montana's agricultural cash receipts. Based on its moderate protein content and lower price, barley is an alternative to corn in finishing cattle diets. Most of Montana barley is produced for animal feed. The objective of this project is to encourage calf producers to retain more feeder calves in Montana by developing improved value feed barley for both the barley grower and cattle producers. Barley has been criticized for cattle feed because of its rapid digestion in the rumen, which can result in many digestive disorders such as bloat and lactic acidosis in cattle fed on high barley diets. A potential approach to limit this problem associated with feeding barley is to select barley cultivars that have a slower rate of digestion in the rumen. Selection of barley grain for low dry matter digestibility (DMD), low acid detergent fiber (ADF) content and high starch content should allow progress in breeding for improved feed quality. The aim of the current thesis is to use DNA marker technology coupled with different barley mapping and validation populations and DMD assays to identify the chromosomal location of genes modifying grain composition and digestibility. The obtained QTLs can be used to transfer the low DMD trait from exotic germplasm resources to high yielding cultivars. The largest QTL impacting DMD that we detected in this project resides on barley chromosome 2H very close to Vrs1. That gene also impacts plant and seed development. The strong correlation among DMD, particle size and yield and the overlapping QTLs which are controlling the variation in these traits around Vrs1, may be due to pleiotropic effects or closely linked QTLs. If this is a pleiotropic effect, gene transfer into 2-rowed backgrounds will be impossible. If, however, linkage is the cause of the association between Vrs1 and DMD-QTL, then larger mapping populations should permit us to better map the gene and identify useful recombinants.

This study found a lack of consensus and understanding among the educators about the purposes and the design of IEFA. The educators believed the most beneficial sources of support for the future implementations of IEFA would be recursive, ongoing and consistent partnerships and collaborations with Indigenous specialists who could equip the educators with the Indigenous knowledge, pedagogies, and skills they needed to build and sustain relationships with Indian students and families. The educators indicated that the greatest obstacles to the implementation of IEFA curricula were: the lasting legacies of colonialism, Native American subjectivity, misrepresentations of Indigenous identities, lack of understanding about Indigenous epistemologies pedagogies and life ways, systemic racism, poor communication, broken relationships, mistrust and lack of rapport, whiteness and white privilege, and a lack of support or professional development opportunities with Indigenous specialists from particular tribal communities in Montana.

My students are, for the most part, potentially very good writers. However, when I get these students, their lab report writing skills are quite limited, and therefore, are very poor. Focus for doing labs thus far in their science career has been how well they can perform the lab from verbal instructions not written instructions. The students have a difficult time reading and understanding what the protocol wants them to do, and they have an even more difficult time explaining what they performed during the lab activity in a lab report. This project investigated how well the students discussed their course of action after performing the lab activity in a written report. The students were given written lab protocols and were expected to follow the procedure and make observations along the way. The labs were all completed in one 45 minute class period. The students were then given one day in class to work on their lab report following the lab report rubric (Appendix A). Data collection for this project not only included lab report writing, but what the students' comfort levels were in different elements of the lab, how well they reviewed their own work, how well they reviewed other peer's work, and how they felt about the whole lab report writing process throughout the year. Several teachers were also asked to evaluate how well these particular students processed and followed directions in their classrooms as well. The resulted indicated that by implementing a peer review session into the lab report writing process the report score significantly improved. The students who struggled at the beginning of the process were now completing quality lab reports in half the time and the peer review rubrics were being scored with the highest marks. Because of these positive outcomes, I know that peer review is an integral part of the learning process to produce quality lab reports and I will continue to conduct this practice in my classroom in years to come.

The major goal of the current work was to perform a thorough geochemical analysis of redox active species in geothermal outflow channels, and utilize these measurements to quantify the Gibbs free energy (?Grxn) values for numerous oxidation-reduction reactions that represent potential chemolithotrophic metabolisms. Insights gained from energetic analyses can be used to structure hypotheses regarding novel microbial metabolisms and to guide cultivation strategies for isolating relevant microorganisms. A comprehensive suite of geochemical parameters, including major ions, trace elements, redox-active species and dissolved gases, were analyzed and monitored in vertical transects of 11 geothermal outflow channels in Yellowstone National Park from 2003-2005. The geothermal springs chosen for this study contained strikingly different aqueous and solid-phase geochemistry. These systems exhibited a wide range of conditions, including ranges in pH (2.7 to 7.0), temperature (60 oC to 92 oC), Cl- (0.01 to 23 mM)), SO42- (0.4 to 7.5 mM), NH4+ (0.02 to 5.7 mM), CO2 (aq) (0.1 to 4.5 mM), Fe (0.2 to 230 uM), and As (0.03 to 130 uM) The predominant changes in geochemistry occurring within geothermal outflow channels were consistently related to the dynamics of air-water gas exchange. In all springs studied, dissolved gases including H2, CO2, CH4 and H2S decreased down gradient of geothermal discharge, while O2 ingassing resulted in increases in dissolved O2. Calculated free energy (?Grxn) values for balanced oxidation-reduction reactions suggest that numerous electron donor/acceptor combinations are exergonic in these systems. Reactions where H2, CH4, H2S, S0, AsIII, FeII and or NH4 serve as electron donors were all significantly exergonic (< -30 kJ mole-1 electron at all sites) when O2 was the electron acceptor, even when O2 levels were at the detection limit (3uM). The geothermal systems included in this study all exhibited significant changes in microbial population distribution from near source-water conditions to sediments lining the outflow channels, consistent with the hypothesis that geochemical gradients and temperature correlate with microbial population distribution.

As a child I would gather fossils, driftwood and animal bones and arrange them into sculptures which I then painted. I was imposing my own order on the natural world and made it part of my personal vision. My pastime of collecting from Nature and rearranging found materials into these early sculptures was a formative experience leading to the imagery apparent in my current body of work. As an artist, I am interested in making sculpture that depicts the evolution of an imaginary species. Evolution, metamorphosis, movement and growth are my main inspirations. To transmute means to change from one form, species, condition, nature or substance into another. Transmutation is expressed by the fusion of unique pieces of driftwood that have animated qualities and combined with natural shapes I have manipulated to create a dynamic organism. The handmade forms are distinguished with general animal and human qualities, such as legs, arms, heads and fingers. The action of growth is exhibited by a rhythm of forms that dissolve and merge, creating the illusion of a world in motion.

My paintings are read like the sky. They are not separate from the viewer; rather, one perceives my paintings as reflections of oneâs own consciousness and the collective consciousness, as nothing less than the spirit itself. While painting I rely on an intuition that dictates my creative process. I listen to the materials and place them exactly, responding to an aesthetic derived from my interest in spiritual objects and space such as the Zen tea bowls, altars, mosques, and tea rooms. Through surface, color, space and materials I create painting with the same emotional qualities as those objects and spaces. Within my paintings I used found, painted, and fabricated elements. My formal concerns are finding correct proportions within the composition and a balance among the colors and materials, thus creating a harmonious relationship. This results in paintings with both natural and handcrafted elements that are simultaneously immaculate and authentic.

It is my opinion that human emotion becomes apparent when two opposing states of reality are intensified within time and space. Today in the Western Culture we live upon two opposing states of time. One is mechanized and ridged, and the other is sequential and durational. The first seeks to break things down into parts and understand them as they relate to a human scale. The other seeks to find the potential in what exist in the in-between and around. Together each of them function. But, are simultaneously different in how they are perceived. The dichotomy and diversity of these two opposing states is where things become intensified within our environment. Through the understanding of this relationship I propose to develop ideas which intensify the two, rather then seeking to find a definitive convergence. This thesis will actively discuss the nature of our condition within the construct of mechanical time vs. durational time. This approach is meant to be an intense experience, one that seeks to find the harshness of the two realities. Upon the ending of this thesis, this harshness will be tested upon a site that connects the visitors to the two opposing states of reality.

It was hypothesized that kinematic parameters of casting (peak and total range of motion, timing of peak joint angular velocity, and magnitude of peak joint angular velocity) would increase in order to cast lines of greater length. Also, it was hypothesized that when greater length of line is cast, the time between peak angular velocities would decrease. The purpose of this study was to determine the kinematic and joint coordination changes necessary to cast lines of different length. Eighteen male subjects participated in the study. Experience ranged from intermediate to expert, with a number of the subjects being professional fly-fishing guides. Twenty three reflective markers were tracked by a 6-camera ViconÂ® digital capture system. Shoulder motion was calculated with respect to the trunk. The elbow was modeled as a uni-axial pin joint and the wrist as a bi-axial pin joint. Subjects performed casts at conditions of 20, 40, 60, and 80 ft. A MANOVA was used to assess effect of line length. The fly casting motion was divided into three primary phases; back cast, pause, and forward cast. Overall, total ROM increased with increased length of line cast. However, wrist radial/ulnar deviation (RD/UD) total ROM changed little across all distances and wrist flexion/extension (F/E) total ROM decreased with increased line length. Peak angular velocity exhibited a proximal-to-distal trend during the forward cast; first peak shoulder internal rotation, then elbow extension and lastly, wrist ulnar deviation. Time between peak angular velocities did not decrease with increased line length. Time between peak shoulder and elbow angular velocities actually increased (p = 0.037) as line length increased. Findings indicate that significant changes in total ROM were needed to accommodate the demands of casting greater lengths of line. Also, joint velocity coordination patterns of fly-casting appear to follow a proximal-to-distal pattern.

Both communities are analyzed as ideological responses of women and girls to consumerism, media conglomeration, mainstream appropriation of movements, and postmodern ""postfeminist"" cultural fragmentation. The far-reaching ""Oprah"" effect on modem publishing is critiqued, as well as the controversies and contradictions of the effect. Oprah is analyzed as a divided text operating in a late capitalist culture with third wave feminist tactics. The Riot Grrrl movement is discussed as the potential beginning of a fourth wave of feminism. The Grrrls redefine feminism and femininity in their music and writings in zines. The two sites are important to study as they are mainly populated by under represented segments of ""postfeminist"" society: middle aged women and young girls."

This procedure fails to address the hydraulic features responsible for the floristic structure and composition of the riparian zone. We looked at how the geology and landforms function as drivers of groundwater and surface-water exchange. These can mitigate watershed processes via groundwater availability to shape riparian processes; e.g. discharge, seasonality. We hypothesized that groundwater surface-water exchange is a first order process and that it dictates riparian water availability and that the underlying geology and landform can serve as a tool to gain greater understanding of a properly functioning riparian ecosystem. We tracked groundwater surface-water exchange using wells, piezometers, water temperature, conservative tracer injections and solute conductivity on an alluvial fan in the Gallatin valley. Southwestern Montana Conservative tracer injection indicated 3% tracer losses over the 1.5km reach. Through spring and summer 2011 groundwater wells and piezometers indicated flashy transient shallow groundwater. Significant late growing season stream discharge (~300 l/s) and standard riparian monitoring assessments would suggest a larger floristic community than what is present at the site. These metrics together suggest a disconnection between the surface-water and groundwater ultimately limiting the extent of the riparian vegetation community. We further determined that the surface water is disconnected from the local groundwater table. We conclude that the lack of surface water - groundwater connectivity drives the floristic structure and character of the riparian zone. Skewed or inaccurate views of riparian functionality may occur because; the current assessment fails to address surface water - groundwater connectivity.

The subject matter is often incorrectly labeled as being in ideological conflict with Modern works of the period, which were steeped in honest visual representations of daily life. Recent scholars have interpreted the nude female figures in this painting as evidence of nineteenth century female economical and sexual emancipation. No painting can escape polyvalency throughout its lifetime, and therefore will encounter multiple interpretations within the changing cultures it inhabits. This thesis uses theoretical paradigms introduced by psychoanalysis and feminist art historians to seek the truth in the plurality of meanings assigned by cultural determinants. Viewers, regardless of period, are inescapably bound by their own experiences and thus, no singular construction holds universal meaning.

Treatments within the study included introducing teacher modeled questioning strategies focusing on application, explanation, and recall and asking students to explain their thinking by asking why at the end of yes or no questions. A series of self-questioning models on cognitive processes were also introduced. Finally, students implemented the learned strategies while conducting their individual/partner research projects. Participants' questioning and inquiry skills were assessed with a series of surveys, recorded interviews, teacher field notes, and peer/self-assessments of their inquiry skills while conducting the research projects.

In moving toward an inquiry-based, student-centered learning environment, it is imperative that students develop skills of critical thinking and argumentation. To accomplish this, students must be able to define a problem, select strategies for solving the problem and defend their choices. This study will attempt to evaluate the amount of improvement of their argumentation skills through the use of a game using the principles of argumentation as stated by Toulmin. Three questions will guide this study: 1. Will activities emphasizing argumentation lead to more sophisticated explanations of curriculum concepts by students? 2. Will students effectively critique each other? 3. Will argumentation assist students in explaining relationships between scientific concepts and what has been observed? The study will take place in a class of grade 9 Physical Science students consisting of 12 girls and 5 boys. Data will be collected using pre and post testing of the concepts of density, buoyancy, heat and thermodynamics. Interviews and formative assessments of students before and after they participate in the studies activities and artifacts from the activity will be coded to measure changes in argumentation performance.

The differences in humanity are fascinating to me, and in my thesis show I want to bring this to light. My thesis show, the Midget Rodeo, explores the oddities of our kind. Our lives today are overrun by computer enhanced models and manicured lawns; I want to show that it is okay to be who we are. We have lost touch with real existence to such an extent that we donât realize what is really important. Americans have created a whole hierarchy of values that are unrealistic. In contrast, the rodeo is an example of a more honest portrayal of ourselves. The midget rodeo is a large installation that fills the entire gallery. The rodeo is comprised of five distinct scenes that are setup in their own environments. One is a singing cowboy on a crude stage. It has the feeling of a makeshift stage made of bales of hay that gives you a feeling of traveling from county fair to county fair. Other scenes range from rodeo clowns to a corral of galloping fantasy horses. All of these are constructed in their own specific setting in the rodeo, for example, a corral or toy horses. All scenes come together to form a collective environment in which they are all present and the viewer is free to interact.

To understand the distribution of biofilm activity, it is necessary to correlate the local nutrient concentration, local mass transport in the biofilm and the biofilm structure. The correlations among surface averaged dissolved oxygen concentration, surface averaged relative effective diffusivity, and areal porosity in the biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 grown in a flat plate reactor, were quantified. Three dimensional distributions of local dissolved oxygen concentration, local relative effective diffusivity, and porosity in the biofilm were measured. It was found that the local dissolved oxygen concentrations and relative effective diffusivities correlate weakly with each other or with the areal porosity. However surface averaged dissolved oxygen concentration and surface averaged relative effective diffusivity strongly correlated with each other and with the areal porosity. The surface averaged dissolved oxygen concentration, surface averaged relative effective diffusivity, and areal porosity decreased towards the bottom of the biofilm, while the coefficients of variation computed for each of these parameters increased towards the bottom of the biofilm. The coefficient of variation is quantified as a measure of the heterogeneity of the biofilm. The increase in the coefficient of variation shows that the heterogeneity of the biofilm increases towards the bottom of the biofilm.

When shooting I used two models and focused on the details of line and contrast between the two bodies. While nude imagery lends itself well to the entire range between literal representation and abstraction, I concentrated on creating abstract compositions of line and form. I have always been fascinated by the reoccurrence of patterns of line and form in both the human body and nature. I have photographed different scenes on different scales in nature and after viewing the final prints, the repetitive shapes and lines, specifically the soft, subtle, and seemingly perfect curve reveals itself. While the sexual essence of classic nude imagery, utilizing the whole of the human body, is often obvious and unmistakable, in this body of work I sought to capture a more ambiguous and androgynous sexuality. I sought to capture pure sexual essence. Both humans and the nature around them exude a similar sexual or sensual essence that becomes obvious to me while I am shooting that expresses itself in recognizable forms from sand dunes to flowers. By ever increasing the size of the images, the grain of the image begins to separate which aids in the conception of lines, shapes and forms I see in nature. The grain of an enlarged image creates some distortion making it difficult to distinguish what part of the body one is viewing. This produces a sense of mystery, which flows within the same path as the ambiguity of line in nature. I have sought to produce a line the human eye can follow from one image to the next by use of composition, physical placement of each image, and the lack of any foreign objects such as; frames, glass, nails and other traditional methods of displaying photographs. The images become a single installation of the essence of natural sexuality and sensuality. The sheer size of the images intensifies that essence.	['photography']

The color and surface of the photographs are manipulated when I change them into paintings. For each painting, this manipulation is slightly different. For example, in some works I like to paint with a dark blue palette with bright oranges for high lights. This is a dramatic change of the colors from what was recorded in the actual photo. At other times, I paint by following the color structure of the photo. Sometimes I simplify information from the photo. The brushstroke is left, to be seen. Additionally, I choose the color for each of the objects, and how thick and how crude the brush stroke is. It is my feeling that this mark of my hand is what elevates this object from a reproduction of a photo to an emotionally charged and special object. I paint this way intuitively. I keep the same value and form as the photo and synthesize a new color scheme and surface to make it a unique image. I paint the scenes of every day life because I can relate ideas, and emotions regarding what it means to be a person. The paintings show human activities and interactions in our culture. The average day in our life defines us as people. I want to paint images that make others think and feel. I want them to relate my work to who they are and what they do.

In western Montana it invades in the foothills zone where bunchgrasses (Agropyron spicatum and Festuca idahoensis) meet low forests (Pinus ponderosa and Pseudosuga menziesii). Our results show that wildfire strengthens toadflax, probably at the expense of native grasses. The stem boring weevil, Mecinus janthinus, is being tested as the most likely biocontrol agent for the weed. On our toadflax infested sites in the Agropyron spicatum/Pinus ponderosa zone Mecinus established, survived, and spread slowly (2-4m/yr) for two years following introduction. At the low initial densities Mecinus induced compensatory growth in toadflax i.e. stem density, plant height, branch number, and seed capsule number all increased. In a garden experiment, we exposed plants to Mecinus at increasingly higher densities (0-32 insects per plant) to measure the effect of a higher attack rate. With exposure rates of 2-4 insects per plant compensatory growth occurred. With exposure rates greater than 8 insects per plant total biomass and especially flower biomasses were reduced. If Mecinus densities in the field exceed eight weevils per plant this may indicate eventual exhaustion and decline of the weed.

He was a common part of American life that is rarely seen today. Now there is home shopping on cable tv., but at one time, there was not a home in the United States that hadnât been visited by one at one time or another. These men traveled across the country knocking on doors, toting their cases, dressed in drab older suits, ringing doorbells for all to let them in. And people did let them in, not knowing who they were or where they came from. The salesmanâs display case was his key to the world. With it, he could get through many locked doors which would otherwise never open to him. As a child, seeing these mysterious men at their work, reading about them in stories, and seeing them portrayed in movies, I wondered about the salesmen and their lives. What did these men see on their journeys and what did they do? Looking at my drawings and paintings, you will find several possibilities.

Group facilitation is an important aspect of a curriculum director's job as she works with a multitude of groups with varying degrees of experience, endless combinations of personalities and an array of purposes and time frames. Group facilitation requires a working understanding of personality and communication, an awareness of social and emotional intelligence and the ability to moderate one's own communication style and presentation to meet the demands of a particular situation. In this paper I present a journey that began with an examination of personality and moved into the realm of communication style, group dynamics and social intelligence. Each of these is closely tied to effective facilitation as well as administration in the field of education. The focus question explored in this paper is ""How can I become a more effective group facilitator?"" It was addressed through a variety of qualitative and quantitative collection techniques including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Communications Style Inventory, critical friend's oral feedback, group member interviews, spontaneous feedback, my professional journal, critical friends survey, and three facilitator effectiveness surveys. These varied data collection techniques were triangulated and cross-examined to support claims made in the discussion. These claims include increased effectiveness as a group facilitator which encompasses improved communication skills and increased ability to be socially intelligent in a variety of situations. The outcome of this self-study was my transformation from a novice district level administrator and group facilitator to one with more experience in self-evaluation and self-reflection and an emerging ability as an effective group facilitator."

In this study, students' computer classes were integrated with a current and relevant science topic (alternative energy resources) to gauge 1) whether students were able to better understand the content presented and 2) how their attitudes towards science were affected by the science instruction. Students completed nine lessons that focused on the use, benefits, and drawbacks of two types of alternative energy: wind energy and algae biofuel. Each lesson was integrated with technology-based activities to enhance student understanding. Student interviews, unit pretests and posttests, journals entries, and attitude surveys were used to monitor student learning and progress throughout the project. The data collection indicated that students came into the project with little science background knowledge and an average interest in science. As the study progressed, students developed a deeper understanding of alternative energy resources. Student attitudes towards the science learning process improved a small amount as well. At the conclusion of the study, all of the students had increased scores on the content tests and most students had small increases on the attitude measures.

The voltage of a single cell under load is approximately 0.7 volts necessitating the use of many cells in series to generate useful electrical potentials, which gives rise to the SOFC stack. One of the key technical challenges in improving the long term performance and reliability of stacks is in the effective sealing of stack interfaces, particularly in planar stacks for which a hot seal (700-900Â°C) is required. SOFC stack seals must be: resistant to oxidation/volatilization in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, must wet and bond to the joining members (both ceramic and metal), form a hermetic seal to prevent hydrogen leakage, and have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) close to that of the adjoining components to limit thermally induced stresses. Active metal copper-based brazes present a novel approach to sealing SOFCs by means of robust mechanical/thermal properties providing strong, hermetic braze-interconnect and braze-YSZ interfaces. A commercially available active braze alloy utilizing no precious metal additives was tested and compared to custom synthesized braze compositions fabricated and tested at MSU. Two testing configurations were evaluated for this sealing study, utilizing dense YSZ substrates joined to 25.24mm, 430SS coupons as well as 25mm 440SS pressure test fixtures. Active braze alloys require a protective atmosphere to facilitate chemical bonding with YSZ and results show excellent performance in moderate vacuum (10-4 to 10-5 mbar) and argon atmosphere. Sample characterization was performed by electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, pressurized rupture and leak tests, differential thermal analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis and thermodynamic evaluation. Robust copper-based brazes show potential for the use of sealing in SOFC applications. The brazes display desirable characteristics for sealing applications including the formation of chemically bonded braze joints, formation of a protective oxide barrier and high strength properties. Evidence of silicon diffusion into the YSZ may be problematic for long-term SOFC operation, however, development of a siliconfree braze has yielded excellent performance near that of the commercially available brazing powder.

Throughout the treatment the students spent more time working with terms chosen for each unit. This included activities that encouraged analysis of word meaning and comparison and analysis of relationships between terms. Summative assessments showed improvement in student comprehension along with increased confidence in their ability to perform lesson objectives. Additionally, the attitude students had toward science vocabulary and science literacy skills were more positive. The students also improved in their writing skills and use of appropriate terminology when working in groups and on projects.

While these pipelines are essential for the operation of natural gas markets, their capacity sets a physical limit on the quantity of gas that can be moved between regions. Taking advantage of a rich data set of daily pipeline capacities and flows, this thesis tests the effects of binding pipeline constraints directly. It is found that these constraints affect the citygate prices for the Florida and Southern California markets. The Law of One Price is tested using cointegration techniques and found to hold when pipeline flows are not constrained, and break down during constrained periods. It is also shown that cointegration techniques may not identify bottlenecks between regions when bottlenecks are not severe, or when they only occur for limited periods of time. Contrary to earlier results, Southern California markets are found to be integrated with the national market. Cointegration tests using data from 14 market points suggest that regional wholesale natural gas markets in the United States are generally integrated into a national market.

The Florida government offered these slaves freedom not as a humanitarian gesture, but with the hope that this policy could both protect their own colony and unsettle the British government of the Carolinas. By 1740, the former British slaves moved into a military fortification called Fort Mose and became soldiers in the Spanish army. This fort thus became the first free black community in what is now the United States. However, while home to a free black militia, St. Augustine was also home to many slaves. Although some historians have recently examined Floridaâs free African community, it remains in partial obscurity. When the history of the black community is told, however, the seemingly obvious contradictions are often ignored and the focus is centered on the free militia only. This thesis examines the creation of Mose and St. Augustineâs inherent paradox in hosting both a slave and free African community. This study covers the history of slaves and free Africans in St. Augustine between the late sixteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Much of the study centers on the early slave population in St. Augustine, the nature of their bondage, and how the city created an environment that allowed a free African population to exist. The principle focus of the study is race relations in the nationâs oldest community, how white residents, free Africans, and enslaved Africans interacted, and how the Spanish government used a policy of racial antagonism in an attempt to unsettle British colonies in the Southeast.

The author tried to identify those resources which were historically used in order to preserve the information as well as resources still in use so they could be protected. He concludes that though it's usually unwise to return to past ways of life, it is possible to learn from the past. Preservation, protection, and perpetuation of the old practices should be a priority. Documenting this information makes it available to others and ensures that the knowledge won't be lost. The author used the historical practice of storytelling for transferring knowledge; learning from the Apsaalooke elders about the relevant material they were familiar with. He explains all the aspects of using this method in detail. Also includes the author's personal experience of getting a Crow name.

Accurate and easily reproducible landcover maps enable monitoring of land management decisions and ultimately a greater understanding of landscape ecology. Multi-season Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2001 combined with ancillary topographic and soils data was used to map wetland and riparian systems in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana. Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) decision-tree based classification algorithms were used to distinguish wetlands and riparian areas from the rest of the landscape. CTA creates a single classification tree using a one-step-look-ahead procedure to reduce variance. SGB utilized classification errors to refine tree development and incorporated the results of multiple trees into a single best classification. The SGB classification (86.0% overall accuracy) was more effective than CTA (61.7% overall accuracy) at detecting a variety of wetlands and riparian zones present on this landscape. A change detection analysis was performed for the years 1988 and 2001. The change detection used Landsat-based Tasseled Cap (TC) components and change vector analysis (CVA) to identify locations of wetland/riparian gain or loss in the 13-year period. CVA of TC brightness, greenness, and wetness components reduces the compound errors of multi-date classifications by using a threshold value to separate land cover change from spectral variability between 1988 and 2001 imagery. Only the highly changed pixels were classified using 1988 Landsat imagery and ancillary data. These change pixels were then merged with the 2001 classified image to develop a wetland/riparian map for 1988. The high overall accuracy of the 1988 classification (81%) developed with this procedure showed the benefits of this technique for mapping historical landcover features. Comparison of the 1988 and 2001 classifications identified locations where wetlands/riparian areas increased, decreased, or remained stable between these years. TC based CVA had an overall change detection accuracy of 75.8% and was able to identify areas of isolated and contiguous wetland/riparian change.

With the aid of committees of homemakers and professional home economists, rating scales were formulated to measure three major aspects of sewing and from them a score was derived for 47 articles of sewing. These values were then applied to the sewing reports of 276 homemakers. The resultant scores were used as a basis for the study of factors thought to influence the amount and kind of home sewing. Lower cost, satisfaction and enjoyment were the chief reasons for home sewing given by the homemakers. The greatest difficulties reported were in pattern alterations, and the construction, fitting and style of garments. These homemakers devoted an average of four hours per week to their sewing activities. Eighty-two percent of the homemakers were doing some sewing and had increased the total amount done during the two war years. Garments most frequently made were house dresses, aprons, and skirts for girls and women and pajamas for all family members. Many more articles were renovated during the two-year-war-time period than for the corresponding pre-war period. The data were secured by questionnaires in which homemakers gave information concerning their family status and their sewing activities and problems. They were requested to estimate the amount of sewing done during the past four years, 1940-1943 to allow a comparison of the amount of sewing done in two years of war time with that done during the two pre-war years. The development of the rating scales which make possible a quantitative evaluation of home sewing is considered the most valuable contribution of this thesis. This device should prove of value to those responsible for clothing curricula, to students as a means of judging their progress, to homemakers desiring an evaluation of their work and to those people interested in making studies relative to home sewing practices.

Yet much of the public is still either hostile to or misunderstands evolution and its mechanisms. Television provides the bulk of the general public's exposure to science once formal education has ended. The rhetorical strategies employed by much of science and evolution programming, along with an emphasis on content over process, delivers the message that science is a search for absolute truths rather than a dynamic process relying on falsification and tentative knowledge. The way in which science and evolution is presented parallels failures in the educational system to teach science as more than just a collection of absolute truths and unassailable facts. In both science teaching and science television, critical thinking often loses out. Science television, especially that dealing with evolutionary themes from the distant past, tends to reinforce an authoritarian view of science by using visual images that are difficult to argue with, and an omniscient narrator. Evolution, and much of science, is counterintuitive and difficult to learn. Presenting subject matter in the absence of context is inadequate for building epistemological structures. Producers, like teachers, must first gain a mastery of the true nature of science in addition to the subject matter they cover, in order to encourage critical thinking in their audiences. Several television programs do an excellent job of this, even though they are far removed from the beautiful and expensive ""blue chip"" films normally considered to be high-quality offerings in science and natural history programming."

The Fort Hall Indian Reservation (FHIR), is located in Bingham, Power, Bannock, and Caribou Counties, Idaho. To estimate the quantitative risk of morbidity and mortality posed to Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri on the FHIR, stream temperatures, or at the very least, a robust estimate of stream temperatures, was needed. The first objective was to examine what stream temperature data were available. The second objective was to obtain elevation values for stream temperature monitoring sites within the FHIR. This helped in the third objective, which was to develop a regression model to predict stream temperatures. The fourth objective was to document thermal preferences of YCT. Cross-referencing thermal thresholds of YCT and stream temperatures allowed for the fifth and sixth objective, which was to create a deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment. The seventh objective was to map out the risk assessment and graphically display risk associated with each major stream reach within the FHIR. The results of this study indicate that a substantial amount of suitable YCT habitat within the FHIR will likely be lost due to increased stream temperatures, a direct result of global climate change. At this local scale the bulk of the habitat loss can be expected in the lower elevation areas of the FHIR. Mid to high elevation areas will also be negatively affected but not as much as the lower elevation areas. This effort led to the understanding that stream temperatures for the current time frame have been increasing as a result of climate change. With the projected increases in future July stream temperatures the optimal habitat for YCT will be significantly diminished as well. Therefore, this study may serve as a call to action to all interested parties within the FHIR, State of Idaho, and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. With the gleaned information and understanding of how stream temperatures will put YCT at higher risk of temperature related morbidity and mortality, it is up to the risk managers of the greater FHIR and the FHIR to take whatever action they deem necessary in their unique environmental management responsibilities.

Despite the many studies that have found running and walking economy to improve with lighter shoes, there are no published studies that show any relationship between the mass of skate skiing equipment and markers of skate skiing performance. To investigate the effects of skate skiing equipment mass on markers of performance, this study added mass to the lower limbs of skate roller skiers and measured changes in economy and gross movement kinematics. Twelve male (MeanÂ±SD; Age (yrs): 21.4Â±3.9) and eight female (MeanÂ±SD; Age (yrs): 19.9Â±2.2) competitive cross-country skiers completed two laboratory visits to roller ski on an oversized treadmill. In the first visit, subjects completed a graded exercise test to determine their lactate threshold. In the second visit, subjects completed 5 minutes of roller skiing at a low work rate (2 m/s for women and 3 m/s for men both at 2Â°) and a high work rate (2 m/s for women and 3 m/s for men both at 3.15Â°) for each of the four limb loading conditions (0 g, 200 g, 400 g, and 600 g). Oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), and cycle rate were measured during the last 2 minutes of each stage and used for analysis. There were no significant differences in HR, VO2, or cycle rate between any of the limb loading conditions at either work rate. However, cycle rate neared significance (P = 0.06), with increases in cycle rate observed during greater limb loading. Interestingly, VO2 and HR significantly increased throughout testing, independent of limb loading condition. The most notable increases were observed in HR values, and increases began within the very first testing stage. Thus, it is likely that the subjects experienced cardiovascular drift due to mild hyperthermia. The effects of hyperthermia might have masked the true effects of lower limb loading. Therefore, future studies still need to investigate the effects of lower limb loading on skate skiing economy and kinematics	['life sciences', 'biology', 'physics', 'mathematics', 'biomechanics', 'kinematics', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'medical sciences', 'biophysics', 'mechanics']

This study measured the EI of 15 principals willing to participate from randomly selected school districts in Wyoming, using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso EI Test (MSCEIT), which measures four categories of EI: (1) Managing Emotions, assessed using the Emotional Management task and the Social Management task, (2) Understanding Emotions, assessed using the Blends task and the Changes task, (3) Using Emotions, assessed using the Sensations task and the Facilitation task, and (4) Perceiving Emotions, assessed using the Faces task and the Pictures task. All teachers from the participating schools were questioned using the David C. Anchin School Culture Quality Survey. This survey measures teachersÎ± perceptions of (1) Having a shared vision, (2) Facilitative leadership, (3) Teamwork and cooperation of staff, and (4) Nurturing a learning community. This instrument is designed specifically to measure the work culture of teachers, which enables them to do their job well. Data analysis included a hierarchical linear model of the current status of teachersÎ± perceptions of the school cultureÎ±s four categories (shared vision, facilitative leadership, teamwork and cooperation, and nurturing a learning community) and the current status of the four categories of emotional intelligence of the principal (managing emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions, and perceiving emotions).

Although researchers have studied the training distributions of high-level cross country (XC) skiers, the unique population of Masters-level XC skiers has been largely overlooked. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to characterize the changes in Masterslevel skiers' training volume and intensity from the fall to mid-winter seasons using telemetry-based heart rate (HR) monitoring. The secondary purpose was to determine the relationship between winter training variables and race speed within the same population. Fifty-six Masters-level skiers volunteered to don a HR monitor and utilize a training log to record all bouts of physical activity over two 14+ day periods designed to correspond with the preparatory (fall) and pre-competition (mid-winter) seasons. After the midwinter collection period, the same subjects recorded HR data while competing in a 34.4 km ski race. All HR data were downloaded to a computer and summarized by absolute training time (T, min) and relative time (%T) spent within six HR zones (Z) which were calculated as percentages of age-predicted maximum HR (APMHR). Training variables were compared using two-factor and three-factor multivariate repeated measures ANOVAs, whereas winter training variables and race HR variables were correlated with race speed using the Pearson product-moment correlation. Only 13 men (MeanÂ±SD: 62Â±5 yrs.) and 15 women (50Â±5 yrs.) completed all of the study requirements. From the fall to winter seasons, weekly training volume was maintained (MeanÂ±SE: 515.7Â±24.2 vs. 514.8Â±31.7 min/week, respectively), but average training HR significantly increased (117Â±2 vs. 123Â±2 bpm, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the %T spent training <70% of APMHR and a significant increase in the %T spent training > or =70% from the fall to winter seasons (53.0Â±3.6% vs. 40.2Â±3.1% and 47.0Â±3.6% vs. 59.8Â±3.1%, respectively). Additionally, the skiers' distribution of training intensity within each season tended to follow a threshold based model, as opposed to the polarized model followed by high-level endurance athletes. While characterizing these training practices helps build the knowledge base necessary for improved coaching of this population, further observational and experimental research is warranted.

Performance outcomes can be determined by the amount, timing, and sources of CHO ingested. High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is thought to be one of the main contributors in the development of obesity and chronic disease, therefore making this CHO source controversial. The study purpose was to determine if a HFCS-sweetened beverage is an acceptable CHO source for prolonged moderate intensity exercise by determining its effects on substrate metabolism during exercise when compared to a dextrose-sweetened beverage (DEXT). Eleven (6 male, 8 female: MeanÂ±SD; 24 Â± 3.9 yrs, 71.8 Â± 12.5 kg, 173.8 Â± 9.5 cm) active healthy adults volunteered to participate in for this study. A baseline blood sample was drawn prior to ingesting half of a 400 mL beverage sweetened with 50 grams of HFCS or DEXT 15 min prior to a 120 min cycle and the other half was consumed 10 min of exercise. This was a randomized, double-blinded study. Blood was collected at -20, 58, and 140 min, tested for glucose, lactate, hemoglobin and hematocrit, then coagulated for 20 min, centrifuged for 10 min for serum separation and analyzed for lipids. Respiratory exchange ratio, HR, and RPE were collected at 20, 50, and 115 min during exercise. Treatment interaction effects were determined using repeated measures ANOVA and a one-way ANOVA, with a Tukey (HSD) post hoc test (alpha level < 0.05). All statistics were mean Â± SD. There were no significant time by treatment interactions or main treatment effects for any dependent variable RER (p=0.996), triglycerides (p=0.451), CHOL (p=0.230), LDL (p=0.875), HDL (p=0.753), VLDL (p=0.439), glucose (p=0.802), HR (p=0.749), RPE (p=0.719), or lactate (p=0.065). However, there was a significant time effect identified for decreasing RER, increasing HR and RPE that were not related to the treatments, but the physical needs of exercise. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates an acute 50 g dose of HFCS at the beginning of prolonged moderate intensity exercise does not induce hypertriglyceridemia and is an adequate CHO source for supplementation.

Including willow, alder, aspen, and cottonwood, DWV was limited in height and areal extent since the early 1900s. Since the mid-1990s; however, DWV has increased in height and areal extent in some locations. Previous studies regarding DWV change have focused on quantifying change in vegetation growth in areas of limited extent and none have quantified increased DWV growth at the scale of the landscape. Furthermore, no studies have evaluated the implications for increased growth of DWV for wildlife in the region or how DWV species themselves may influence rates of growth. In this thesis I evaluate change in DWV within wetland and riparian areas using aerial photographs from 1991 and 2006. I also investigate how an increase in willow, the dominant component of DWV in the region, has likely influenced bird diversity. Finally, since willow species vary with respect to genetic limitations on growth and reproduction that in turn may influence observed patterns of growth; I examine willow species composition across the northern range. Results of the air photo interpretation revealed a 170% increase in DWV. Most plots that increased did so by recruitment rather than densification; however, DWV was difficult to detect below 100 cm indicating that the number of plots increasing by recruitment may have been overestimated. Bird community variables were examined in three willow growth conditions: height suppressed, recently released, and previously tall (tall prior to observed increase in growth). I found that willow structure generally increased in complexity from structurally simple height suppressed willows to structurally complex previously tall willows and that this allowed for greater bird richness, abundance, diversity, and the abundance of several willow dependent bird species. I also found that willow species composition was similar and diverse between the released and previously tall condition, but that the suppressed condition was dominated by a singe species. I conclude that increased DWV has allowed for greater bird diversity in the northern range and that increased willow growth in the suppressed condition may be influenced by species composition there.

We investigated the ramifications of two such practices. First, we investigated targeted sheep grazing for cover-crop termination. Second, we compared the community dynamics of carabid beetles (Coleoptera:Carabidae), a group of beneficial insects in agroecosystems, among three vegetation systems in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) production. Cover-crops are grown to improve soil quality and reduce erosion. While cover-crops do not provide a direct source of revenue, integrating livestock grazing to terminate them could provide alternative revenue. We conducted a two year study of the impacts terminating cover-crops with sheep grazing on soil quality, weed and carabid communities, and crop yield in a diversified vegetable market garden. In 2012 and 2013, we seeded a four species cover-crop that was terminated by either tractor mowing or sheep grazing following a completely randomized design. In 2013, we planted spinach, kohlrabi, and lettuce into previously grazed or mowed plots following a split-plot design. The cover-crop provided forage worth $24.00 - $44.00 ha -1 as a grazing lease. There were no differences in soil chemistry, compaction, temperature or moisture between grazed and mowed plots. Despite temporal shifts in weed and carabid community structure, we found no differences in those communities between termination methods. Finally, cash crop yields did not differ between strategies. Our results suggest that this practice can provide an economic benefit for producers without detrimental agronomic or ecological consequences. Alfalfa is the third biggest crop in Montana by gross revenue. As a perennial crop, it can allow for high populations of pest and beneficial insects. Practices that favor predatory insects could enhance biological control of pests. We conducted a two year study investigating carabid community dynamics and habitat preferences of common carabid species under three habitat management strategies: monoculture alfalfa, barely nurse-cropped alfalfa and uncultivated refugia. Our results indicate that carabid communities vary among the three systems. Barley nurse-crop systems had greater total carabid activity-density than either of the other two system, which suggests that nurse-cropping may be an effective habitat management strategy to enhance carabid populations.

These systems are found in thermochromic ""smart windows"" that tint reversibly in response to temperature increases in their environment providing the benefit of energy savings in commercial and private buildings. Despite the stoichiometrically simple equilibrium for these ligand exchange systems, there is a complex and delicate network of chemical interactions that determine the color, and thermodynamic performance. Accurate computational modeling of nickel(II) ligand exchange thermochromic systems is an important first step in the direction of understanding the parameter space that determines whether a given metal ligand system is thermochromic, the color of the high and low temperature species, the temperature at which the system will change color. The research presented in this dissertation uses experimental results to evaluate theoretical models. Core and valence electronic spectroscopies probe the ground and excited state electronic structures of high temperature nickel(II) thermochromic chromophores which range from the very covalent nickel tetrathiocyclotetradecane thiocrownether to the highly ionic nickel dibromodi(1-pentylbenzimidazole)nickel(II). The experimental electronic structures of these high temperature species combined with experimental ligand exchange thermodynamics are used to guide the evaluation of computational modeling methods in search of methods that reproduces the experimental observables. It is found that commercially relevant nickel(II) thermochromism takes place on an extremely flat potential energy surface governed by ion pairing, hydrogen bonding and dispersion interactions. The modeling of these surfaces requires the explicit consideration of ion pairing and solvent-solute interactions."

Variations in knowledge and perception of risk related to radon exposure exist among diverse populations and the known link to lung cancer is not known by all that are at risk. Both the World Health Organization and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) conduct large efforts to raise awareness and educate residents how to lower indoor radon to an acceptable level. These efforts show variable efficacy and in some places radon awareness and testing rates remain very low. Montana is classified as a high-risk area for indoor radon concentrations of an unacceptable level according to the USEPA. In order to evaluate the efficacy of current educational efforts, it is important to measure the level of awareness and concern that exists especially in high-risk areas. This study uses data from a nursing-based environmental health hazard intervention to measure the perceived knowledge and risk perception surrounding radon exposure among residents of rural Montana. Findings indicate that awareness is low and the majority of residents lack strong feelings of concern about radon. These findings are discussed in relation to existing literature and studies related to radon and how the role of the advance practice nurse can be used to positively impact public health in relation to radon exposure prevention.

We focus on the Northern High Plains region, where we are able to compare regions with extremely low access to health services with those with relatively high levels of access. Objective: This study aims to identify health disparities in rural communities, particularly among Native American populations, and, thereby, begin to determine the most effective means by which to deliver health services to areas where geography, economics, and culture might prevent traditional models of health delivery from providing sufï¬cient incentives for the prevention of adverse cancer-related outcomes. Methods: The Health Care Accessibility Index (HCAI) is computed through the use of principal component analysis and includes economic variables as well as variables concerning institutional and geographic access to health care. Index values are then regressed onto cancer outcomes, cancer-prevention outcomes, and cancer-related risk, using weighted least squares and quantile regressions. Results: Counties with relatively poor access to health care (low HCAI) also have statistically (1) lower breast cancer screening rates, (2) higher smoking prevalence, and (4) higher cancer-related mortality rates. Breast cancer screening is found to be especially sensitive to areas of low health accessibility. Conclusions: Empirical results provide support for policy efforts to increase the accessibility of health care services that are targeted to areas with mammography screening rates, high obesity rates, high smoking prevalence, as well as areas near Native American reservation territories.

Sleep is essential for mental and physical well being and good sleep hygiene practices promote high quality sleep. Poor sleep quality can increase the risk of a myocardial infarction in persons with CHD. The purpose of this descriptive study was to describe sleep patterns and practices of adults diagnosed with CHD and participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Two survey tools, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Sleep Hygiene Index, were used to collect data on a convenience sample of 31 adults participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs located in southern Montana. The questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 69.3%. Study results indicate poor sleep quality in this sample population which was primarily due to poor sleep efficiency and sleep disturbance. Sleep hygiene practices of this sample were relatively good, with only a few areas of deficiencies observed. The findings from this study provide a basis for future research. Future research needs to approach the cardiac rehabilitation population on a larger scale and determine if specific sleep hygiene practices correlate with poor sleep quality. Nurse practitioners and other providers can incorporate this knowledge into interventions to promote sleep and sleep hygiene practices.

The objective of this study is to examine recent trends over the last 30 years in Light Use Efficiency (LUE) and inherent Water Use Efficiency (iWUE*) for the major biomes of Africa, including their sensitivities to climate and CO2. LUE and iWUE* trends are analyzed using a combination of NOAA-AVHRR NDVI3g and fAPAR3g, and a data-driven model of monthly evapotranspiration and Gross Primary Productivity (based on flux tower measurements and remote sensing fAPAR, yet with no flux tower data in Africa) and the ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms) process-based land surface model driven by variable CO2 and two different gridded climate fields. The iWUE* data product increases by 10%â20% per decade during the 1982â2010 period over the northern savannas (due to positive trend of vegetation productivity) and the central African forest (due to positive trend of vapor pressure deficit). In contrast to the iWUE*, the LUE trends are not statistically significant. The process-based model simulations only show a positive linear trend in iWUE* and LUE over the central African forest. Additionally, factorial model simulations were conducted to attribute trends in iWUE and LUE to climate change and rising CO2 concentrations. We found that the increase of atmospheric CO2 by 52.8 ppm during the period of study explains 30%â50% of the increase in iWUE* and >90% of the LUE trend over the central African forest. The modeled iWUE* trend exhibits a high sensitivity to the climate forcing and environmental conditions, whereas the LUE trend has a smaller sensitivity to the selected climate forcing.

This study evaluates the effect of library instruction from a broader perspective by examining the pre- and posttest (instruction) levels of studentsâ perceptions toward plagiarism ethics. Eighty-six students completed a pre- and posttest survey that measured their ethical perceptions of plagiarism scenarios. The survey used the multidimensional ethics scale (MES) developed by Reidenbach and Robin that is used commonly in business ethics research. The study found that the MES is a reliable tool to measure changes in ethical perceptions of plagiarism. Further, results indicate that students had higher posttest perceptions of plagiarism ethics than they did prior to library instruction. These results suggest that library instruction was effective and had a meaningful impact on studentsâ perceptions toward plagiarism ethics.

In order to anticipate the potential range of changes to forests in the future and to better understand the development and state of forest ecosystems at present, a variety of forest ecosystem models of varying complexity have been developed over the past 40 years. While most of these models focus on representing either forest demographics including age and height structure, or forest biogeochemistry including plant physiology and ecosystem carbon cycling, it is increasingly seen as crucial that forest ecosystem models include equally good representations of both. However, only few models currently include detailed representations of both biogeochemistry and demographics, and those mostly have high computational demands. Here, we present TreeM-LPJ, a first step towards a new, computationally efficient forest dynamics model. We combine the height-class scheme of the forest landscape model TreeMig with the biogeochemistry of the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. The resulting model is able to simulate forest growth by considering vertical spatial variability without stochastic functions, considerably reducing computational demand. Discretization errors are kept small by using a numerical algorithm that extrapolates growth success in height, and thereby dynamically updates the state variables of the trees in the different height classes. We demonstrate TreeM-LPJ in an application on a transect in the central Swiss Alps where we show results from the new model compare favorably with the more complex LPJ-GUESS. TreeM-LPJ provides a combination of biological detail and computational efficiency that can serve as a useful basis for large-scale vegetation modeling.

Nest success is a critical component of the breeding output of birds in different environments; but to obtain the complete picture of how bird populations respond to perturbations, we also need an estimate of nest abundance or density. The problem is that raw counts generally underestimate actual nest numbers because detection is imperfect and because some nests may fail or fledge before being subjected to detection efforts. Here we develop a state-space superpopulation captureârecapture approach in which inference about detection probability is based on the age at first detection, as opposed to the sequence of re-detections in standard captureârecapture models. We apply the method to ducks in which (1) the age of the nests and their initiation dates can be determined upon detection and (2) the duration of the different stages of the breeding cycle is a priori known. We fit three model variants with or without assumptions about the phenology of nest initiation dates, and use simulations to evaluate the performance of the approach in challenging situations. In an application to Blue-winged Teal Anas discors breeding at study sites in North and South Dakota, USA, nesting stage (egg-laying or incubation) markedly influenced nest survival and detection probabilities. Two individual covariates, one binary covariate (presence of grazing cattle at the nest site), and one continuous covariate (Robel index of vegetation), had only weak effects. We estimated that 5â10% of the total number of nests were available for detection but were missed by field crews. An additional 6â15% were never available for detection. These percentages are expected to be larger in less intense, more typical sampling designs. User-friendly software nestAbund is provided to assist users in implementing the method.

Variation in attendanceânonattendance patterns can have implications for subsequent recruitment. We used open robust-design multistate models and 28 years of encounter data for prebreeding female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii [Lesson]) to evaluate hypotheses about (1) the relationships of temporary emigration (TE) probabilities to environmental and population size covariates and (2) motivations for attendance and consequences of nonattendance for subsequent probability of recruitment to the breeding population.

The recent discovery of approximately equation-of-state-independent relations among certain multipole moments in neutron stars suggests that they are also approximately bald. We here explore the yet unknown origin for this universality. First, we investigate which region of the neutron starâs interior and of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find that the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment is dominated by the starâs outer core, a shell of width 50%â95% of the total radius, which corresponds to the density range 1014â1015 g/cm3. In this range, realistic neutron star equations of state are not sufficiently similar to each other to explain the universality observed. Second, we study the impact on the universality of approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An analytical calculation in the nonrelativistic limit reveals that the shape of the ellipsoids per se does not affect the universal relations much, but relaxing the self-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the eccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the stellar eccentricity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly 20%â30% in the region that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above analysis for differentially rotating, noncompact, regular stars and find that this time the eccentricity is not constant, with variations that easily exceed 100%, and moreover universality is lost. These findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate symmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from noncompact star region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside stars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity contours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior multipole moments.

To efï¬ciently detect and address these declines requires unbiased and precise demographic data. Unfortunately, the characteristics that make large carnivores extinction-prone also pose serious challenges to obtaining these data. Rapid survey methods exist, but provide only relative measures of abundance, cannot detect declines before they become large, and provide little or no information about the causes of decline. African lions (Panthera leo) are declining throughout their range, making accurate monitoring of remaining populations urgent. We provide statistically rigorous estimates of population size, trends, survival rate and ageâsex structure from Zambiaâs South Luangwa lion population from 2008 to 2012, just prior to cessation of hunting in 2013. Mark-recapture models ï¬t to data from intensive monitoring of 210 individual lions in 18 prides and 14 male coalitions indicated a declining population, low recruitment, low sub-adult and adult male survival, depletion of adult males, and a senescing adult female population. Trophy hunting was the leading cause of death, with 46 males harvested. Based on these data we recommend continuing the hunting ban at least to 2016 to allow recovery, with substan-tially reduced quotas, age-limits, and effective trophy monitoring mandated thereafter should hunting resume. Similar data from intensive monitoring of key Zambian lion populations is required to evaluate effects of the hunting ban and provide management guidance. Effectively integrating intensive long-term monitoring and rapid survey methods should be a priority for future management and monitoring of carnivore species.

We also tested the role of life stress as a moderator of the link between early anger and the development of behavior problems. Although traditional measures of anger were largely unrelated to later behavior problems, profiles of anger that dissociated typical from atypical development predicted behavior problems during preschool. Moreover, the relation between infant anger profiles and preschool behavior problems was moderated such that, when early life stress was low, infants with atypical profiles of early anger showed more preschool behavior problems than did infants with normative anger profiles. However, when early life stress was high, infants with atypical and normative profiles of infant anger did not differ in preschool behavior problems. We conclude that a discrete emotions approach including latent profile analysis is useful for elucidating biological and environmental developmental pathways to early problem behaviors.

The knowledge about potential climate change impacts on forests is continuously expanding and some changes in growth, drought induced mortality and species distribution have been observed. However despite a signiï¬cant body of research, a knowledge and communication gap exists between scientists and non-scientists as to how climate change impact scenarios can be interpreted and what they imply for European forests. It is still challenging to advise forest decision makers on how best to plan for climate change as many uncertainties and unknowns remain and it is difï¬cult to communicate these to practitioners and other decision makers while retaining emphasis on the importance of planning for adaptation. In this paper, recent developments in climate change observations and projections, observed and projected impacts on European forests and the associated uncertainties are reviewed and synthesised with a view to understanding the implications for forest management. Current impact assessments with simulation models contain several simpliï¬cations, which explain the discrepancy between results of many simulation studies and the rapidly increasing body of evidence about already observed changes in forest productivity and species distribution. In simulation models uncertainties tend to cascade onto one another; from estimating what future societies will be like and general circulation models (GCMs) at the global level, down to forest models and forest management at the local level. Individual climate change impact studies should not be uncritically used for decision-making without reï¬ection on possible shortcomings in system understanding, model accuracy and other assumptions made. It is important for decision makers in forest management to realise that they have to take long-lasting management decisions while uncertainty about climate change impacts are still large. We discuss how to communicate about uncertainty e which is imperative for decision making e without diluting the overall message. Considering the range of possible trends and uncertainties in adaptive forest management requires expert knowledge and enhanced efforts for providing science-based decision support.

However, this is not straightforward or well-studied among large mammals with group sizes that range several orders of magnitude or aggregation patterns that vary across space and time. To address this issue, we examined spatial variation in elk (Cervus canadensis) aggregation patterns and brucellosis across 10 regions in the Greater Yellowstone Area where previous studies suggest the disease may be increasing. We hypothesized that rates of increasing brucellosis would be better related to the frequency of large groups than mean group size or population density, but we examined whether other measures of density would also explain rising seroprevalence. To do this, we measured wintering elk density and group size across multiple spatial and temporal scales from monthly aerial surveys. We used Bayesian hierarchical models and 20 years of serologic data to estimate rates of increase in brucellosis within the 10 regions, and to examine the linear relationships between these estimated rates of increase and multiple measures of aggregation. Brucellosis seroprevalence increased over time in eight regions (one region showed an estimated increase from 0.015 in 1991 to 0.26 in 2011), and these rates of increase were positively related to all measures of aggregation. The relationships were weaker when the analysis was restricted to areas where brucellosis was present for at least two years, potentially because aggregation was related to disease-establishment within a population. Our findings suggest that (1) group size did not explain brucellosis increases any better than population density and (2) some elk populations may have high densities with small groups or lower densities with large groups, but brucellosis is likely to increase in either scenario. In this case, any one control method such as reducing population density or group size may not be sufficient to reduce transmission. This study highlights the importance of examining the density-transmission relationship at multiple scales and across populations before broadly applying disease control strategies.

There are several theories that suggest diversiï¬cation in a microbial community may enhance stability and robustness, decrease concentration of inhibitory intermediates, and increase efï¬ciency. Theoretical studies to date have focused on proving when the stable co-existence of multiple strains occurs, but have not investigated the productivity or biomass production of these systems when compared to a single âsuper microbeâ which has the same metabolic capacity. In this work we prove that if there is no change in the growth kinetics or yield of the metabolic pathways when the metabolism is specialised into two separate microbes, the biomass (and productivity) of a binary consortia system is always less than that of the equivalent monoculture. Using a speciï¬c example of Escherichia coli growing on a glucose substrate, we ï¬nd that increasing the growth rates or substrate aï¬nities of the pathways is not suï¬cient to explain the experimentally observed productivity increase in a community. An increase in pathway eï¬ciency (yield) in specialised organisms provides the best explanation of the observed increase in productivity.

Because the oocysts are more resistant to environmental stresses than the bacteria conventionally used as indicators of fecal contamination, they can be present in water when indicator organisms, such as E. coli, are not found. In addition, because they are resistant to chlorine, they can pass from source water through water treatment into drinking water systems. The EPA method for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts consists of identifying oocysts with fluorescently labeled antibodies, staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and examining slides with epifluorescent microscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy. This protocol is labor intensive and subject to technician error. A new method was developed for the rapid detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and the ScanRDI, a solid phase laser cytometer. Optimization of the FISH protocol for use with the ScanRDI was done with E. coli cells and known Cryptosporidium oocysts as a model. Source water and treated drinking water from the water treatment plant at Crow Agency on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana was collected over the course of a year and concentrated using the EPA protocol for collection of oocysts. The samples were then examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts using both the ScanRDI method and the standard US EPA method. The combination of FISH for labeling Cryptosporidium and the ScanRDI for examination results in significantly higher numbers of Cryptosporidium detected as well as greater ease in identification. A statistical comparison was done that determined there was no correlation between the number of E. coli cells found in the water samples and the number of Cryptosporidium oocysts present. Additionally, although not tested on environmental samples, the FISH/ScanRDI method allowed for simultaneous detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and E. coli cells on the same membrane filter. Membranes were incubated before hybridization, hybridized concurrently with a Cryptosporidium specific probe and a probe specific for E. coli, followed by detection for both organisms with the ScanRDI.

Grades were earned according to a 4-Point Scale and the student's trend was the final grade. Metacognition was accessed through predictive scoring of assessments. Results indicate that students benefit from the detailed feedback inherent to SBG while predictive scoring quantifies metacognition for the student and teacher. A mixed-methods design was used in the data collection and analysis to provide a holistic view of the impact of SBG on student metacognition. The metacognitive improvement was verified quantitatively by a calibration score indicating 97% accuracy of student final exam score prediction (n=43).

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of sheep grazing compared to tillage and herbicide application for weed control on soil total C, total N, NH 4-N, and NO 3-N contents at the 0-120 cm depth from 2009 to 2011 and greenhouse gas (CO 2, N 2O, and CH 4) emissions from May to October, 2010 and 2011 under dryland cropping systems in western Montana. Treatments were three fallow management practices (sheep grazing [GRAZ), herbicide application [CHEM], and tillage [MECH]) and three cropping sequences (continuous alfalfa [CA], continuous spring wheat [CSW], and spring wheatpea/barley hay-fallow [W-P/B-F]). Soil samples were collected with a hydraulic probe after crop harvest and greenhouse gas samples at 3 to 14 d intervals with a static chamber. Soil total C was greater in CSW and W-P/B-F than in CA at 5-30 cm but was greater in CA and CSW than in W-P/B-F at 60-90 cm. Soil total N and NO 3-N contents were greater in CSW and W-P/B-F than in CA at 5-120 cm. Soil NH 4-N content varied with treatments and years. Soil temperature and water content at 0-15 cm were greater in CHEM with W-P/B-F and GRAZ with CA than in other treatments. Greenhouse gas fluxes peaked immediately following substantial precipitation (>12 mm) and/or N fertilization, regardless of treatments. Total CO 2 flux from May to October was greater in GRAZ with CA but N 2O flux was greater in CHEM and GRAZ with CSW than in other treatments in 2010 and 2011. Total CH 4 flux was greater in CA than in CSW and W-P/BF in 2011. Net global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity were greater in CHEM with CSW than in other treatments. Continuous spring wheat increased soil C and N storage and available N at subsurface layers compared to other cropping sequences. Because of higher N 2O emissions and lower C sequestration rate, global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity increased under continuous spring wheat with herbicide application for weed control.

Many forms are pathogenic and represent a major threat to human health, but viruses recently have been used as nanoscale tools for gene therapy, drug delivery and enzyme nanoreactors. Viruses have historically been viewed as static and rigid delivery vehicles, but over the last few decades they have been recognized as flexible structures. Their structural dynamics are a crucial element of their functionality. Characterizing the biophysical properties of these viruses is both challenging and exciting. We have developed and used a multidimensional approach to tackle this task. Our techniques include Differential Scanning Fluorimetry, which probes the melting temperatures of virus capsids by the use of a fluorescent dye and Hydrogen-Deuterium Mass Spectrometry, which investigates the flexibility of the virus capsid protein by following the change in mass when Hydrogen is exchanged with Deuterium. Flexible regions exchange more. The above techniques are well complemented by the use of size-exclusion chromatography, which differentiates virus capsids based on their hydrodynamic radius and Limited proteolysis which again probes dynamic regions of the capsids up to the amino acid level. We have studied two different systems, Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and Adeno-associated virus (AAV) using these methodologies. The sum result of these assays indicate that, in case of CCMV, capsids can undergo structural transitions due to very subtle pH and cation concentrations and the capsid protein is capable of rigid body transitions which affect the stability, while maintaining most of the secondary structure. In the case of AAV, the inherent sequence differences explains only partially the differences in stability and proteolytic susceptibility.

The beams are to be used as test articles in four point bending tests. The motivation behind this thesis is to study the effects that specific manufacturing parameters have on the resulting amounts of porosity and fiber volume in these three-dimensional sub-scale structures. The parameters considered are number of layers of flow media, fabric architecture, flow rate of the resin, temperature of the resin, and level of vacuum pressure used. The manufacturing parameters were varied in a 1/2 factorial design of experiments where sixteen beams were manufactured, all with varying values for each parameter. A taguchi design of experiments was also formed to provide a comparison. The resulting average porosity percentages and fiber volume percentages were then determined for every beam. In addition, compression and tension tests were conducted to find the average maximum stresses for each. Once all the data had been gathered an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) study was conducted to determine the effects and their levels of significance. It was found that the level of vacuum pressure has the most significant effect on the porosity while the fabric architecture has the most significant effect on the fiber volume. Overall, every parameter has some sort of quantifiable effect on porosity and fiber volume. There are also significant two and three way interaction effects present for each. Additionally, the 1/2 factorial design seemed to provide more accurate results compared with the taguchi design, which was inherently not comprised of data with a normal distribution and does not include interaction effects. Regression models were developed for the output levels of porosity and fiber volume. This allows manufacturers to create these beams with predetermined output levels for each and can improve testing capabilities. Also, using two layers of flow media greatly improved the consistency of the beams, while reducing porosity and slightly reducing fiber volume percentage. It is recommended to further implement the use of two layers of flow media into large sub-scale structures and potentially full scale turbine blades.

It is composed of three informal members: an upper shale member, a middle silty limestone/dolostone member, and a lower shale member. The Bakken petroleum system acts as a conventional and unconventional reservoir within the Williston Basin and fractures that occur naturally within the Bakken petroleum system can either help or hinder reservoir characteristics. Unconventional reservoirs, such as the Bakken Formation, rely heavily on fracture enhancement (hydraulic fracturing) to become producible oil plays. Pre-existing fractures and weaknesses open more readily with fracture stimulation than the creation of new fractures, and have been correlated to increased early production in shale plays. To determine the influence of these fractures on the reservoir in the Bakken Formation and its correlative units, fractures in core and outcrop were examined. Clay-rich shales, such as those within the Bakken Formation, display high intrinsic anisotropy, which can be helpful in interpreting seismic profiles. Despite the importance of shale oil reservoirs, the contribution of preferred orientation of minerals to shales is not well constrained. These constituent clay minerals are phyllosilicates that acquire preferred orientation during sedimentation and early diagenesis. Hard X-rays produced from a synchrotron source are effective at extracting orientation distributions of individual mineral components within a shale. Crystallographic preferred orientation can be determined through synchrotron X-ray diffraction and the interpretation of three-dimensional images by using a Rietveld refinement method. This method incorporates a least squares approach to produce a calculated model of the degree of preferred orientation. Samples of the Bakken shales from wells in North Dakota and Montana, and outcrops from southwestern Montana were investigated. Individual phyllosilicate minerals such as illite, smectite, muscovite, and chlorite yield individual orientation patterns. The elastic properties of each shale sample were determined by averaging the calculated properties of each mineral phase over their orientation distributions. The presence of specific clay minerals and degree of anisotropy is highly variable from well to well. A better understanding of shale anisotropy could help improve exploration and production of unconventional shale oil reservoirs.

Many of these accidents are the result of uncertainty regarding the stability of the snowpack. Spatial variability of snow stability is a significant cause of this uncertainty. There has been significant previous work on the spatial variability of snow stability at multiple spatial scales, but most of these studies have focused on measures of fracture initiation. This study investigates the spatial variability of Extended Column Test (ECT) results (an index of fracture propagation). We measured the spatial variability of ECT results in 23 grids across southwest Montana over the course of two winters. These slopes were all topographically uniform, wind sheltered clearings, with snowpacks relatively undisturbed by skiers or snowmobiles. Twenty eight ECTs were spaced across each grid in a standardized layout with a 30 m x 30 m extent. Our results are consistent with previous work, with some grids showing high levels of variability as well as other grids with relatively homogenous results. We found no consistent spatial pattern to our test results. We tested slopes with a variety of weak layers (surface hoar, depth hoar, new snow, and near surface facets), slab characteristics (slab hardness, slab depth), and snow depths and found no correlations with ECT results. We found a relationship between the forecasted regional avalanche danger and the percent of ECTs showing propagation in a grid. As the regional danger increases the percent of ECTs propagating in a grid does as well. ECT results are most variable under moderate danger. When the regional avalanche danger is either considerable or low, results are likely to be more consistent. The key practical implication of our results is that ECTs, like all other stability tests, should be interpreted with an appropriate level of caution and in consideration of all other relevant variables. The spatial variability of this test has the potential to be high on some slopes, while on other slopes test results will be entirely in agreement.

The sediments of the river are enriched with As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn which are toxic metals to humans and animals. It is hypothesized that microorganisms living in this river sediment can remove the metals and thus detoxify their environment. The objective of this work is to investigate the microbial communities existing in CDAR sediment using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and 16S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChip) analysis. According to our phylogenetic analysis, the CDAR clones fell into 13 distinct phylogenetic classes including 2 environmental samples, 1 uncultured bacterium, and an unclassified Chloroflexi. The major representative genera found were Thiobacillus (7 of 91), Azoarcus (7/91), Acidobacterium (6/91), Burkholderia (5/91), Flavobacterium (5/91) and Janthinobacterium (5/91). PhyloChip data showed the presence of 1551 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). 97% of the clone library sequences matched at various taxonomic levels with the microarray results. The results from the clone library and PhyloChip have provided the broad picture of the microorganisms found in the metal polluted CDAR sediment. To better understand the metal toxicity kinetics of specific isolates, Pseudomonas sp. strain JM001 from the CDAR sediment was selected for further study. Cell growth and aqueous Zn removal rate of strain JM001 was observed in batch kinetic experiments. It was found that cell growth rate depends on substrate and nutrient concentration and incubation temperature. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Zn to the cells was 0.024 mM and the 50% inhibition in specific growth rate was found at 0.011 mM Zn when cells were grown in nutrient limited defined media at 22 Â°C. The MIC was 1 mM Zn and 50% inhibition occurred at 0.515 mM Zn in minimal salts medium with vitamin solutions at 35 Â°C. The results are significant to develop a dose-response model that will quantify the effects of toxic metals on microbial growth and inhibition in complex CDAR environment.

Computer simulations provide an interactive and visual environment that promote and support conceptual change in physics education. They are tools that enable students to become actively engaged in their learning and encourage concept exploration and assist in developing their inquiry skills. One area that students consistently retain misconceptions is that of their understanding of Newtonian mechanics and the application of his three laws to motion problems. It is through the implementation of a series of inquiry based student activities that these simulations will be evaluated for their effectiveness in improving conceptual understanding.

These differences have been attributed to the amount of change in processing context. Therefore, the study also examined contextual changes in musical pieces. A 2 x 3 factorial design experiment measured differences in verbal duration estimates made for prospective and retrospective conditions. In these conditions there were three music stimulus pieces: a simple, a complex, and a mixed type. In the retrospective condition, mixed type duration estimates were significantly longer than in the prospective condition. Also in the retrospective condition, mixed type duration estimates were reported as significantly longer than both the simple and complex music types. These findings provide further support for differences in prospective and retrospective paradigms (Block, Hancock & Zakay, 2010; Block & Zakay, 1997) as well as the contextual-change hypothesis for retrospective duration judgment (Block & Reed, 1978).

It analyzes the extent to which alcohol and the drunkenness that frequently accompanied and shaped early American history. It argues that the Transatlantic marketplace functioned as a drug that early Americans associated with consumerism, including rum, wine, beer, and other beverages. It also examines the role of centralized colonial authority, questioning the effectiveness of tavern legislation in regards to public intoxication. Furthermore, it scrutinizes taverns as not only social and political institutions but also as biological institutions, a social necessity that exploits our evolutionary past. The research is interdisciplinary, using an eclectic mix of social and biological sciences, including neurology and social psychology, chemical toxicology and anthropology. Alcohol is a powerful chemical and it shares a long and storied relationship with our species. Taverns are vital, but neuro-consciousness and intoxication are the stars of this thesis. Alcohol is the great Silent American Actor and it will be treated as such throughout this work.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of a CEP within a municipal government, five years after implementation. This was a mixed methods study where an electronic survey first measured perceptions of ethical climate followed by interviews with ethics administrators and anonymous employees. After five years, the municipal employees rated their environment as somewhat ethical through two measures; an overall ethics score (an average of 35 items from an ethical climate assessment), and a single item rating of the ethical climate by employees. Both measures can be used as a benchmark of organizational ethics health. Observations of misconduct were low in comparison to national statistics and reporting of misconduct was low in comparison to national statistics. Binary logistic regression was conducted on the overall ethics score and observations of misconduct and was statistically significant in distinguishing between employees who observe misconduct from those who do not. One ethics factor, ethical leadership, was also statistically significant in distinguishing between employees who observe misconduct and those who do not. Ethics factors that were not reliable predictors of observations of misconduct included the code of ethics, ethics resources, independent ethics commission, ethical decision-making, and informal ethical norms. Employees also rated the most effective components of the ethics program. Role modeling by peers, role modeling by supervisors, talking about ethics on the job, annual ethics training, the code of ethics, and the ethics handbook were rated as the most effective components. Six interviews with employees deepened the understanding of the quantitative data. Key themes of leadership and concerns about reporting and retaliation emerged through the interviews. CEP outcomes identified in the interviews included enhanced awareness and talking about ethics, seeking advice for ethical dilemmas, cross-departmental conversations, ethics code revisions, ethics resources for employees, and learning from training examples and interactive discussions.

Pulse magnetic resonance experiments show that the lifetime TXY against deuteron jumping between X- and Y-oriented hydrogen bonds is 15 msec at 70Â°C with a jump activation energy of approximately 0.58 ev. The c-axis electrical conductivity of KD2PO4 is found to have the same activation energy, with a value of 1.16Ã10â10 (ohmcm)â1 at 25Â°C. The Îm=1(P1) and Îm=2(P2) deuteron spin-lattice relaxation transition probabilities due to XâY jumps have been calculated from the known values of TXY and the electric field gradient tensors at X and Y deuteron sites. Their magnitudes and the dependences of these magnitudes on magnetic field, temperature, and orientation are in good agreement with experiment. Further measurements of P1 and P2 separately give a component of transition probability proportional to exp(0.078 ev/kT) and independent of magnetic field. The orientation dependences of P1 and P2 for this component indicate quadrupolar relaxation due to deuteron jumps along hydrogen bonds, with a jump time of order 10â11 sec at 215Â°K. The existence of intrabond jumps governed by an activation energy is shown to be consistent with the Slater theory of KH2PO4 as modified by Takagi.

In the nineteenth century, the rise of Western imperialism threatened the survivals of all three realms. Unlike their East Asian neighbors, Japan, China, and Siam preserved a large measure of self-rule though they had to cede significant amounts of sovereignty. To defend their societiesÎ± interests, their leaders sought to modernize their political, social, and economic structures. In the process, they abandoned existing educational systems in favor of Western models and practices. The purpose of this comparative study was to better understand the motivations, methods, and results of their educational modernizations by examining their educational development from the seventeenth to the mid-twentieth century. The study answered four main questions: (1) What motivated these societies to modernize their educational systems using Western models and practices? (2) How did they accomplish their educational modernizations? (3) How did they adapt Western models to suit their political, social, economic, and cultural circumstances? (4) What were the broad results of their educational modernizations? Although the inquiry heavily relies on English secondary sources, some primary-source and Japanese materials were considered. The analysis employed such recognized qualitative/historical methods as constant comparison, triangulation, negative case analysis, and internal criticism. The study found that the Japanese, Chinese, and Siamese made the adoption of European and American educational approaches a central component of their modernization strategies. While employing similar borrowing methods, namely textual study, foreign experts, study abroad, and external help, they incrementally rebuilt their educational systems through trial and error experimentation. In adapting Western models, all three added elements of their traditional ideologies. Although each nation recovered their full sovereignty, the political, social, and economic consequences of their educational modernizations differed. Nonetheless, educational reform was uniformly a catalyst for far-reaching change. Ultimately, their eclectic borrowing and shrewd adaption of foreign ideas and practices allowed the Japanese, Chinese, and Thais to create their own versions of modernity. Without the successful creation of modern educational systems, these three societies could not have become the strong nations they are today.	['history']

Recently, Google announced that it would begin to favor websites that use the secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) in its search results rankings. HTTPS encrypts data transmission and one of Googleâs stated reasons for this change is to help make the Web safer and minimize data theft. Similar announcements by Google have sometimes been ignored by librarians, to the peril of the visibility and use of library products and services on the Web.

Here, we apply a PCR-directed approach to determine the distribution, abundance, and diversity of hydA gene fragments along co-varying salinity and O2 gradients in a vertical water column of Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT. The distribution of hydA was constrained to water column transects that had high salt and relatively low O2 concentrations. Recovered HydA deduced amino acid sequences were enriched in hydrophilic amino acids relative to HydA from less saline environments. In addition, they harbored interesting variations in the amino acid environment of the complex H-cluster metalloenzyme active site and putative gas transfer channels that may be important for both H2 transfer and O2 susceptibility. A phylogenetic framework was created to infer the accessory cluster composition and quaternary structure of recovered HydA protein sequences based on phylogenetic relationships and the gene contexts of known complete HydA sequences. Numerous recovered HydA are predicted to harbor multiple N- and C-terminal accessory iron-sulfur cluster binding domains and are likely to exist as multisubunit complexes. This study indicates an important role for [FeFe]-hydrogenases in the functioning of the GSL ecosystem and provides new target genes and variants for use in identifying O2 tolerant enzymes for biotechnological applications.

Geochemical and isotopic evidence suggests that pyrite oxidation is a dominant weathering process generating protons that drive mineral dissolution in many subglacial systems. Here, we provide evidence correlating pyrite oxidation with chemosynthetic primary productivity and carbonate dissolution in subglacial sediments sampled from Robertson Glacier (RG), Alberta, Canada. Quantification and sequencing of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) transcripts suggest that populations closely affiliated with Sideroxydans lithotrophicus, an iron sulfide-oxidizing autotrophic bacterium, are abundant constituents of microbial communities at RG. Microcosm experiments indicate sulfate production during biological assimilation of radiolabeled bicarbonate. Geochemical analyses of subglacial meltwater indicate that increases in sulfate levels are associated with increased calcite and dolomite dissolution. Collectively, these data suggest a role for biological pyrite oxidation in driving primary productivity and mineral dissolution in a subglacial environment and provide the first rate estimate for bicarbonate assimilation in these ecosystems. Evidence for lithotrophic primary production in this contemporary subglacial environment provides a plausible mechanism to explain how subglacial communities could be sustained in near-isolation from the atmosphere during glacial-interglacial cycles.

Yet, research exploring predictors of alcohol use among American Indians has been limited by cross-sectional designs and reservation-based samples. Guided by a life course developmental perspective, the current study used a subsample of American Indians (n = 927) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to explore alcohol use (current drinking, usual number of drinks, and binge drinking) among this population. We examined whether adult social roles (i.e., cohabitation, marriage, parenthood, college enrollment, and full-time work) were linked to the rise and fall of alcohol use. Multi-level models demonstrated that adult social roles were linked to alcohol use at the within- and between-person levels. Becoming a parent was linked to a lower likelihood of being a current drinker, fewer alcoholic drinks, and less frequent binge drinking. Transitioning to full-time work was associated with a higher likelihood of being a current drinker and more frequent binge drinking. Results point to the importance of exploring within-group trajectories of alcohol use and highlight the protective and risky nature of adult social roles among American Indians.

The ac susceptibility for the oneâdimensional Ising model is obtained for arbitrary coupling strength in the presence of a dc bias field strong enough to align most of the dipoles in one direction. The dipole flip probability is assumed proportional to the Boltzmann factor corresponding to half the energy change resulting from the flip. The general expression for ac susceptibility is analyzed in three limiting cases: weak coupling with strong bias, strong coupling with strong bias, and strong coupling with weak bias. In the latter case, relatively long chains of antiâaligned dipoles exist and give rise to large susceptibility.	['applied mathematics']

The dc conductivity and ac dielectric susceptibility of normal and deuterated lithium hydrazinium sulfate have been measured over a wide temperature range at frequencies up to 9.33 GHz. Over a very large temperature and frequency range the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are very large (up to Îµâ²âÎµ''â106) and vary with frequency somewhat as fâ12. This unusual behavior is shown to result form the nearly one-dimensional protonic conductivity and its extreme sensitivity to barriers caused by local structural defects. Etching studies indicate that the crystal is not ferroelectric, implying that the apparent hysteresis loops result from saturation of the ac conduction.

As a result, rapid sampling opportunities within distribution systems are needed that can provide information on the source, species and fate of introduced pathogens. In this study, a porous media biofilm reactor was used to investigate the ability of an established mixed-species drinking water biofilm to immobilize cyan-labeled Escherichia coli 0157:H7 as a model pathogen. Test reactors were colonized with biofilm for two or three weeks at 0.5 mg/l C, resulting in the formation of thin and thick biofilms, respectively. Colonized reactors were then injected with slug doses of approximately 1 x 109 cfu E. coli O157:H7. Plate counts were able to successfully close a mass balance on E. coli O157:H7 around the reactor and were used measure the fractions of inocula immobilized within reactors. Compared with control reactors (0.22%), reactors colonized for two or three weeks immobilized significantly more cells (0.75% and 9.37% respectively). For E. coli O157:H7 passing through the reactor, retardation with respect to the bulk fluid was measured. Retardation factors (Rf) indicated that cells traveling through colonized reactors were significantly retarded compared to those traveling through clean control reactors, resulting in a prolonged washout of cells. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and direct microscopic counts were also used to enumerate E. coli O157:H7 cells. Threshold cycle (CT) values from qPCR typically underestimated the plate counts for effluent samples and were highly inconsistent with respect to enumerating cells entrained in biofilm or attached to reactor surfaces. Possible inhibition by biofilm-associated substances was investigated. Direct microscopic counts were not possible when homogenized biofilm was present and otherwise consistently overestimated plate counts by an average of 0.6 orders of magnitude. This data shows that engineered porous media systems colonized with biofilm may be an effective tool for immobilizing pathogens from bulk flow in drinking water distribution systems.

Individual heterogeneity in wild animal populations has been accounted for and quantified by including individually varying effects in models for markârecapture data, but the real need for underlying individual effects to account for observed levels of individual variation has recently been questioned by the work of Tuljapurkar et al. (Ecology Letters, 12, 93, 2009) on dynamic heterogeneity. Model-selection approaches based on information criteria or Bayes factors have been used to address this question. Here, we suggest that, in addition to model-selection, model-checking methods can provide additional important insights to tackle this issue, as they allow one to evaluate a model's misfit in terms of ecologically meaningful measures. Specifically, we propose the use of posterior predictive checks to explicitly assess discrepancies between a model and the data, and we explain how to incorporate model checking into the inferential process used to assess the practical implications of ignoring individual heterogeneity. Posterior predictive checking is a straightforward and flexible approach for performing model checks in a Bayesian framework that is based on comparisons of observed data to model-generated replications of the data, where parameter uncertainty is incorporated through use of the posterior distribution. If discrepancy measures are chosen carefully and are relevant to the scientific context, posterior predictive checks can provide important information allowing for more efficient model refinement. We illustrate this approach using analyses of vital rates with long-term markârecapture data for Weddell seals and emphasize its utility for identifying shortfalls or successes of a model at representing a biological process or pattern of interest.

Conservation of these species is guided in part by knowledge of relationships between nest survival probability and habitat features. Positive relationships between duck nest survival and amount and configuration of herbaceous perennial vegetation have been observed in previous studies, but these 2- to 4-year studies might not have adequately characterized the temporal effect of wetâdry episodes on nest survival. Over an eight-year period, we studied nest survival of five species of ducks in the PPR relative to spatial and temporal variation in pond density, primary productivity, and hydrologic status of wetlands, soil, and vegetation on 52 study sites selected to span a gradient of spatial variation in proportion of herbaceous perennial vegetation and in number of wetland basins. We observed the fate of 12 754 nests. Consistent with past studies, 90% of nests that failed to hatch were destroyed by predators. Nest survival probability was positively related to current-year pond density and primary productivity, negatively related to pond density and primary productivity during the previous two years, and positively related to the number of wetland basins on the study site. Predicted relationships between nest survival and proportion or configuration of herbaceous perennial vegetation in the surrounding landscape were not supported. For mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), median estimated nest survival probability ranged from 0.02 (SE = 0.01) to 0.22 (SE = 0.02). Estimated nest survival was greatest on sites with numerous wetland basins that had transitioned from dry, unproductive conditions to wet, productive conditions in the previous 1â2 years. Our results were consistent with time-lagged responses of food webs to resource pulses in a broad array of ecosystems. Our study highlighted the importance of wetland basins and wetâdry episodes to duck nest survival in the PPR. Current habitat conservation efforts focus on landscapes with numerous wetland basins and a high proportion of herbaceous perennial vegetation. Our results suggest that future conservation efforts should focus on preserving high-density wetland complexes across as large a geographic extent as possible even in cropland-dominated landscapes.

The Boltzmann transport equation is used, with the collision term calculated from the electrostatic interactions between the mobile ion and the vibrating lattice. In particular the proton mobility in ice is calculated. The lattice vibrations are approximated by a Debye spectrum for translational vibrations of water molecules, plus an Einstein spectrum for modes in which protons vibrate almost as independent particles. Scattering by phonons somewhat below the Debye cutoff frequency is of the greatest importance in determining the mobility, and the proton modes have negligible effect. The calculated mobility agrees reasonably well with the experimental value.	['applied mathematics']

Field studies that rely on fixes from GPS-collared predators to identify encounters with prey will often underestimate the frequency and strength of antipredator responses. These underestimation biases have several mechanistic causes. (1) Step bias: The distance between successive GPS fixes can be large, and encounters that occur during these intervals go undetected. This bias will generally be strongest for cursorial hunters that can rapidly cover large distances (e.g., wolves and African wild dogs) and when the interval between GPS fixes is long relative to the duration of a hunt. Step bias is amplified as the path travelled between successive GPS fixes deviates from a straight line. (2) Scatter bias: Only a small fraction of the predators in a population typically carry GPS collars, and prey encounters with uncollared predators go undetected unless a collared group-mate is present. This bias will generally be stronger for fissionâfusion hunters (e.g., spotted hyenas, wolves, and lions) than for highly cohesive hunters (e.g., African wild dogs), particularly when their group sizes are large. Step bias and scatter bias both cause underestimation of the frequency of antipredator responses. (3) Strength bias: Observations of prey in the absence of GPS fix from a collared predator will generally include a mixture of cases in which predators were truly absent and cases in which predators were present but not detected, which causes underestimation of the strength of antipredator responses. We quantified these biases with data from wolves and African wild dogs and found that fixes from GPS collars at 3-h intervals underestimated the frequency and strength of antipredator responses by a factor >10.

Water temperature is widely regarded as playing a key role in determining their persistence, but specific lethal levels and thermal optima for this cutthroat trout subspecies had not been precisely defined. This laboratory study used the acclimated chronic exposure method to determine tolerances and thermal optima of westslope cutthroat trout and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, a potential nonnative competitor now occupying much of the former range of westslope cutthroat trout. Rainbow trout had a distinct survival advantage over westslope cutthroat trout at warmer temperatures. The ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature (temperature at which 50% of the population survives for 60-d) of rainbow trout (24.3Â°C; 95% CI, 24.0 - 24.7Â°C) was 4.7Â°C higher than that of westslope cutthroat trout (19.6Â°C; 95% CI, 19.1 - 19.9Â°C). In contrast, the optimum growth temperature for westslope cutthroat trout (13.6Â°C; 95% CI, 10.3 - 17.0Â°C) over the 60-d test period was very similar to that of rainbow trout (13.1Â°C; 95% CI, 6.8 - 18.2Â°C), although rainbow trout grew better over a wider range and at higher temperatures than did westslope cutthroat trout. The upper lethal and optimum growth temperatures for westslope cutthroat trout are in the lower range among most salmonids. The higher upper temperature tolerance of rainbow trout and its greater ability for growth at warmer temperatures may account for its increased occurrence at lower elevations than cutthroat trout. Water quality standards setting maximum daily temperatures from 13-15Â°C, near the optimum growth temperature, would ensure suitable thermal habitat to maintain the persistence of westslope cutthroat trout populations. In addition, survival and growth parameters indicated in this study can be used with stream temperature modeling to predict suitable habitat for westslope cutthroat trout, as they may be particularly susceptible to increases in stream temperature associated with climate change. Such predictions of habitat suitability will be vital in prioritizing conservation efforts with respect to reintroduction and translocation of westslope cutthroat trout.	['temperature']

The material research was spurred with discovery and successful implementation of Giant Magnetoresistance phenomena into critical components of devices. GMR devices essentially were multilayered thin films of a set of magnetically ordered metals. Fe-Mn thin films were used to create one of its moment pinning layers. Fcc Fe-Mn thin films were studied enthusiastically for their AFM properties but very little was known about the rare bcc structured single crystals. Bcc Fe-Mn was found to be ferromagnetic in parts of phase diagram of Fe-Mn. The magnetic moment of alloys usually follows a regular linear trend based upon electronic configuration of constituent elements, known as Slater-Pauling curve. While most alloys follow the trend, bcc Fe-Mn binary alloys show a dramatic collapse in the bulk magnetic moment, as concentration of Mn is varied. In this work, we successfully fabricate bcc single crystal thin film of Fe-Mn on MgO(001) substrate by Molecular Beam Epitaxy method. We confirm using Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction that, the bcc phase of Fe-Mn thin film is achieved, albeit being a forced structure, stable up to 35% of Mn concentration. X-ray absorption spectra of individual elements were used to confirm the compositions of Fe-Mn films and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism was used to track the elemental magnetic moment as the composition was varied. We found that the magnetic moment of Fe drops faster than expected and Mn has very small identical moment in all compositions. We also successfully created a compositionally graded Fe-Mn sample in MBE and spatially mapped its Fe moment by around the critical composition. The mechanism for collapse of magnetic moment over a spread of composition of Mn is a very complex problem yet we provide our experimental findings of unprecedented resolution to confirm that bcc Fe-Mn can be structurally stable up to 35% Mn and that the magnetic moment of the alloy starts with onset of Fe moment at 14% Mn and is complete by 17% Mn.

P. J. White et al. recently questioned these results, concluding that âmultiple lines of evidence and/or strong validation should be brought to bear before relying on indirect measures of how predators affect pregnancy rates.â Here, we systematically surveyed available data and found that five studies (with data from 10 widely distributed populations) have directly detected decreases of 24â43% in elk pregnancy rates in response to increased predation risk. This survey includes data not discussed by White et al. from their own research, which reveal a 32% decrease in pregnancy rates following wolf recolonization in central Yellowstone. Following the survey of available data, we discuss several methodological and statistical problems in White et al.'s study that would be expected to mask the effects of predation risk. While other factors also clearly affect elk recruitment, multiple lines of evidence using a broad array of methods have detected an association between predation risk and reduced reproduction in elk.

The objectives of this investigation are to identify features associated with the J-2 unconformity and measure the range of permeability for each of these features. These features include dune lithofacies contacts, lag and reworked deposits, polygonal fracture networks, interdunes and paleowater tables. Petrographic image analysis, cathodoluminescence, x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray elemental analysis are used to characterize possible depositional and diagenetic influences on the range of permeability for each feature. J-2 dune facies are the most common and have a similar range in permeability to that shown by wind ripple laminations. Polygonal fracture networks can be weak or well developed and can be poorly to well cemented. Permeability variation in polygonal fracture networks is based on the intensity of cementation and would only significantly affect horizontal communication in a reservoir. Paleowater tables are generally well cemented, much like wet interdune deposits, and act as permeability barriers to fluid flow. Lag and reworked deposits are likely the result of sediment gravity flows generated either by topographic relief or from dunes bypassing on the incipient J-2 surface. Depending on the thickness and cementation of the lag and reworked deposits, these could act as significant permeability barriers and even generate stratigraphic traps. While permeability is reduced in many of these deposits by their depositional character, samples with ~5% cement generally have permeabilities that are 150mD or less and samples with more than 10% cement generally have permeabilities less than 10mD. Samples with this intensity of cementation are intensely concretionary, interdunes, paleowater tables, polygonal fractures, or reworked deposits.

However, bread and durum wheat are genetically isolated from each other due to an unequal number of genomes that cause sterility when crossed. Previous work allowed identification of a 6X and 4X parent that when crossed resulted in a large number of recombinant progeny at both ploidy levels. In this study, interspecific recombinant inbred line populations at both 4X and 6X ploidy with 88 and 117 individuals, respectively, were developed from a cross between Choteau spring wheat (6X) and Mountrail durum wheat (4X). Lines within each population contained a mixture of alleles from each parent for loci in the A and B genomes. The presence of the D genome in the 6X population resulted in increased yield, tiller number, and seed size. The D genome also resulted in a decrease in stem solidness, lower test weight and fewer seed per spike. Similar results were found with a second RIL population containing 152 lines from 18 additional 6X by 4X crosses. Several additional QTL for agronomic and quality traits were identified in both the 4X and 6X populations. Positive durum alleles increasing kernel weight in hexaploids, on chromosomes 3B and 7A may be useful for introgression by bread wheat breeders.

Development of resistant cultivars would provide great economic benefit to growers. From 2012-2013, a set of backcross lines (MT08185//MT08184/Persia 20) was screened twice for resistance to P. neglectus. Progeny and parent lines were grown in infested soil for 16 to 18 weeks. Nematodes were then extracted from roots of individual plants and counted to obtain per plant final populations. ANOVA results from the 2013 screen showed significant differences in mean P. neglectus populations among lines (p < 0.01). The median final population of susceptible parent MT08184 was an estimated 4.9 times greater than that of resistant parent Persia 20. A 2013 field trial in the absence of root lesion nematodes indicated reductions in grain yield, volume weight, and protein were not associated with resistance. Seven RLN-resistant lines were identified in field evaluations with agronomic phenotypes for yield, volume weight and protein comparable to those of five widely-grown checks. Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to RLN will facilitate marker-assisted introgression of resistance genes in a backcross-breeding program. Single-marker analysis of 218 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) was performed to identify genomic regions associated with resistance to P. neglectus. The analysis identified putative marker-trait associations on chromosomes 1AL, 1DS, 2BL, 5BL, 5DL, 7AL and 7DL (all p < 0.05). Overall, phenotypic screens as applied were inadequate to consistently characterize wheat lines for RLN resistance. As such, RLN resistance phenotypes and putative QTL effects identified in the study must be verified in future experiments.

Although redshirting is widely used for athletic reasons, the academic effects of redshirting are unknown. Academic achievement is an area of interest for the NCAA. Student-Athletes in the 2007 cohort achieved a federal graduation rate (FGR) of 66 percent compared to the general student body's rate of 65 percent. Although student-athletes have a higher FGR than the general student body, athletes in the major revenue producing sports lag behind. Football players that attended Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) schools reached a FGR of 62 percent and athletes that played men's basketball at NCAA Division I schools earned an FGR of 47 percent. This paper uses individual-level data from SuperPrep Magazine and Montana State University (MSU) to examine the relationship between redshirting and academic performance. To address potential endogeneity, this thesis considers a propensity score matching (PSM) approach when using data from SuperPrep Magazine. PSM results indicate that selection bias is present in ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates, but that there are still substantial positive impacts of redshirting on graduation. OLS estimates using MSU data indicate there may be lagged benefits of redshirting on academic performance, although these results are not robust when a fixed-effects analysis is applied.

Remote sensing technology provides the tools to view the ecological dynamics at a landscape scale and review the change through time with time series data availability. Creating congruence between data scales and functional scales is a long standing challenge for Earth system scientists. In this research we evaluate methods for change detection and scaling data in a discontinuous permafrost zone of central Alaska and is characterized by pronounced permafrost thaw and methane release over decadal to century timescales. The primary goal is to evaluate the applicability of Landsat satellite remote sensing for detecting bog thermal expansion over time. We implement a Random Forests classification scheme in order to separate the landscape into its various land features and bog types, many features in this landscape are developed through an aged-stage transition of thermal expansion. The results of this classification were dominated by hydrologic features, with a 0.05 increase in mean albedo, providing essentially no change in both mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and mean Brightness Temperature (BT). In addition, we attempt to capture the scales of variation within the landscape using multi-resolution methods. The scale of variance as illustrated by a wavelet analysis for NDVI show the greatest amount of variance around 4.5 km to 5 km. Brightness Temperature had three peaks of high variance between 0.06 km - 1 km including maximum variance at about 0.5 km and a pair of peaks between 3 km and 4 km. An important component of any data analysis is quantifying the uncertainty. Uncertainty quantification in remote sensing data analysis is often over looked. In a second analysis we attempt to quantify the primary sources of uncertainty in Landsat remote sensing data via simulation methods. Specifically, we evaluate the level of uncertainty contributed to the data by applying a typical atmospheric correction through Monte Carlo simulation approach to estimate the total variance within several Landsat scenes. We find the contribution of uncertainty due to the MODTRAN conversion to be between 7-27% differing by total scene variance per image.

The purpose of this study was to determine if two selected public Carnegie High Research Activity institutions were utilizing market orientation practices (Jaworksi and Kohli, 1993; Narver and Slater, 2000) as evidenced in their organizational culture, to enhance undergraduate recruitment and retention strategies. Through case study research design the research questions queried whether a market orientation was present or emerging at two public Carnegie High Research Activity Institutions. Further, the study attempted to determine if an organizational culture could influence market orientation practices relevant to institutional recruitment and retention outcomes. Based upon the findings and the resulting conclusions, it appeared a market orientation does positively affect retention outcomes at both institutions. Further, in these two instances, it does appear that an organizational culture can affect the ""market orientation-ness"" of the institution. The findings do not indicate there is conclusive evidence of a market oriented recruitment focus, with the exception of University B's effort to recruit specific and targeted groups."

By analogy to the relationship between BChl c and BChl d (20-desmethyl-BChl c), a fourth type of BChl, BChl f (20-desmethyl-BChl e), should exist but has not yet been observed in nature. The bchU gene (bacteriochlorophyllide C-20 methyltransferase) of the brown-colored green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum limnaeum was inactivated by conjugative transfer from Eshcerichia coli and homologous recombination of a suicide plasmid carrying a portion of the bchU. The resulting bchU mutant was greenish brown in color and synthesized BChl fF. The chlorosomes of the bchU mutant had similar size and polypeptide composition as those of the wild type (WT), but the Qy absorption band of the BChl f aggregates was blue-shifted 16 nm (705 nm vs. 721 nm for the WT). Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that energy transfer to the baseplate was much less efficient in chlorosomes containing BChl f than in WT chlorosomes containing BChl e. When cells were grown at high irradiance with tungsten or fluorescent light, the WT and bchU mutant had identical growth rates. However, the WT grew about 50% faster than the bchU mutant at low irradiance (10 Âµmol photons m-2 s-1). Less efficient energy transfer from BChl f aggregates to BChl a in the baseplate, the much slower growth of the strain producing BChl f relative to the WT, and competition from other phototrophs, may explain why BChl f is not observed naturally.

This organism produces volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have both fuel and biological potential.Under microaerophilic growth environments, the organism produces 1, 4-cyclohexadiene, 1 methyl-,1-4 pentadiene and cyclohexene, 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)- along with some alcohols and terpenoids of interest as potential fuels. The fungus was scaled up in an aerated large fermentation flask, and the VOCs trapped by Carbotrap technology and analyzed by headspace solid âphase microextraction (SPME) fiber-GC/MS. Under these conditions, Nodulisporium sp. produces a series of alkyl alcohols starting with 1-butanol-3-methyl, 1- propanol-2-methyl, 1- pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1- octanol, 1-nonanol along with phenylethyl alcohol.The organism also produces secondary alkyl alcohols, esters, ketones, benzene derivatives, a few terpenoids, and some hydrocarbons. It appears that many of the products have fuel potential. Furthermore, the VOCs of Nodulisporium sp. were active against a number of pathogens causing death to both Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizoctonia solani and severe growth inhibition produced in Phytophthora cinnamomi and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum within 48 hr of exposure. The Carbotrapped materials somewhat mimicked the bioactivities of the culture itself when certain test organisms were exposed to these VOCs. A brief discussion on the relationship of these fungal VOCs to those compounds found in transportation fuels is presented.

Utilizing replacement series diagrams, we assessed the importance of growing conditions in the competitive ability of C. sativa. Results indicated that canola and Bromus tectorum were superior competitors in both loam and sandy soils, thus providing evidence that C. sativa may not be as competitive as previously indicated.

(Solanaceae), is an important vegetable crop in the Mariana Islands (Guam, Saipan, Rota and Tinian). Because tomato is heavily attacked by both the tomato fruitworm Helicoverpa armigera HÃ¼bner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and the red spider mite Tetranychus marianae McGregor, research was begun in 2011 to develop an integrated pest management program to better protect the crop from these pests. Our previous studies have indicated nominal threshold levels for T. marianae to be 8-12 mites/leaf in the dry season and 8-14 mites/leaf during the wet season, while for H. armigera the threshold was found to be 2 eggs per 10 of the plants, followed by an additional pesticide application only if 2 damaged fruit or H. armigera larvae were detected per 50 immature fruits. Other studies have found the IPM package used here of petroleum spray oil (PSO), BotaniGard, neem, and DiPel applied 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after tomato transplant to be a viable approach, significantly reducing the pest complex and giving higher tomato yield compared to both the growersâ current practice (carbaryl or malathion, 15 applications per cropping season) and control plots. The current field study was conducted at two locations in Guam (Yigo and Inarajan), USA, in 2012 and 2013 to compare this IPM package with the growersâ current practice in larger plots designed to educate the growers. The IPM package significantly lowered the pest complex and gave higher tomato yield at both the locations. Tomato growers were invited to attend an informal IPM training program on December 16, 2013 at the University of Guam, which was attended by 48 growers from four Mariana Islands. Of these growers, 41 (85%) were aware of and understood the risks associated with traditional insecticides and recognized the concept of using an IPM package in managing tomato pests before the workshop. However, all the attendees understood the concept and benefits of IPM after the workshop. Follow up with these tomato growers found that 35 (73%) later adopted the IPM program using PSO, BotaniGard, and Dipel at 15, 30, 45 and 60 DAT in the Mariana Islands.

Since the 1950s, conventional insecticides such as lindane provided effective and inexpensive protection from wireworms, and little integrated pest management research (IPM) was conducted. The removal of these products from the agricultural market, particularly Lindane, has resulted in increasing levels of wireworm damage to small grain, corn, and potato crops. The wireworm damage has become an increasing problem for growers, so the demand for a meaningful risk assessment and useful methods to restrict damage is increasing. However, due to the cryptic habitat of the wireworms, pest control is very difficult and leads to unsatisfying results. The prospective appropriateness of sex pheromone traps for employing management strategies against wirewormâs populations was first suggested with experimentation in Hungary and Italy. Simultaneously, considerable work has been done on the identification and use of pheromone traps to monitor population of click beetles. The work has been mostly done in European and former Soviet Union countries. For this paper, we reviewed what work has been done in monitoring the click beetle which was considered as pests and how the pheromones can be used in IPM to monitor and control wireworms/click beetles. Also, the possibilities of using the pheromone-baited traps for mating disruption and control tested in the fields were summarized.

Two fungi (Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum), four nematodes species (Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema kraussei, Steinernema feltiae, and Heterorthabditis bacteriophora), an insect growth regulator (diflubenzuron/dimilin), and a botanical-based chemical (azadirachtin/Aza-direct) were used as foliar sprays. These control agents significantly reduced damage caused by C. cinctus larvae, compared to the untreated control or treatment with water alone. No yield differences were observed among entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes, and low risk insecticides. The effectiveness of azadirachtin, diflubenzuron, the entomopathogenic fungi, and the nematodes persisted at the 28th day post application, by which time the wheat had been harvested. Stubbles collected after harvest showed significantly fewer sawfly larvae in the plots treated with entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes, diflubenzuron, and azadirachtin compared to the untreated and water spray plots, indicating that these biorational pesticides have potential to be used as alternatives to conventional pesticides for controlling the wheat stem sawfly larvae.

It is a model organism for studies of cyanobacterial metabolism and has great potential for biotechnological applications. It exhibits an exceptional tolerance of high-light irradiation and shows very rapid growth. The habitats from which this and closely related strains were isolated are subject to changes in several environmental factors, including light, nutrient supply, temperature, and salinity. In this study global transcriptome profiling via RNAseq has been used to perform a comparative and integrated study of global changes in cells grown at different temperatures, at different salinities, and under mixotrophic conditions, when a metabolizable organic carbon source was present. Furthermore, the transcriptomes were investigated for cells that were subjected to a heat shock and that were exposed to oxidative stress. Lower growth temperatures caused relatively minor changes of the transcriptome; the most prominent changes affected fatty acid desaturases. A heat shock caused severe changes of the transcriptome pattern; transcripts for genes associated with major metabolic pathways declined and those for different chaperones increased dramatically. Oxidative stress, however, left the transcript pattern almost unaffected. When grown at high salinity, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 had increased expression of genes involved in compatible solute biosynthesis and showed increased mRNA levels for several genes involved in electron transport. Transcripts of two adjacent genes dramatically increased upon growth at high salinity; the respective proteins are putatively involved in coping with oxidative stress and in triggering ion channels. Only minor changes were observed when cells were grown at low salinity or when the growth medium was supplemented with glycerol. However, the transcriptome data suggest that cells must acclimate to excess reducing equivalents when a reduced C-source is present.

Six phototrophic microbial mat communities from different geothermal springs (YNP) were studied using metagenome sequencing and geochemical analyses. The primary goals of this work were to determine differences in community composition of high-temperature phototrophic mats distributed across the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem, and to identify metabolic attributes of predominant organisms present in these communities that may correlate with environmental attributes important in niche differentiation. Random shotgun metagenome sequences from six phototrophic communities (average â¼53 Mbp/site) were subjected to multiple taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional analyses. All methods, including G + C content distribution, MEGAN analyses, and oligonucleotide frequency-based clustering, provided strong support for the dominant community members present in each site. Cyanobacteria were only observed in non-sulfidic sites; de novo assemblies were obtained for Synechococcus-like populations at Chocolate Pots (CP_7) and Fischerella-like populations at White Creek (WC_6). Chloroflexi-like sequences (esp. Roseiflexus and/or Chloroflexus spp.) were observed in all six samples and contained genes involved in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis and the 3-hydroxypropionate carbon fixation pathway. Other major sequence assemblies were obtained for a Chlorobiales population from CP_7 (proposed family Thermochlorobacteriaceae), and an anoxygenic, sulfur-oxidizing Thermochromatium-like (Gamma-proteobacteria) population from Bath Lake Vista Annex (BLVA_20). Additional sequence coverage is necessary to establish more complete assemblies of other novel bacteria in these sites (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes); however, current assemblies suggested that several of these organisms play important roles in heterotrophic and fermentative metabolisms. Definitive linkages were established between several of the dominant phylotypes present in these habitats and important functional processes such as photosynthesis, carbon fixation, sulfur oxidation, and fermentation.

L-Rha catabolic pathways were previously characterized in various bacteria including Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, homology searches failed to recognize all the genes for the complete L-Rha utilization pathways in diverse microbial species involved in biomass decomposition. Moreover, the regulatory mechanisms of L-Rha catabolism have remained unclear in most species. A comparative genomics approach was used to reconstruct the L-Rha catabolic pathways and transcriptional regulons in the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Thermotogae. The reconstructed pathways include multiple novel enzymes and transporters involved in the utilization of L-Rha and L-Rha-containing polymers. Large-scale regulon inference using bioinformatics revealed remarkable variations in transcriptional regulators for L-Rha utilization genes among bacteria. A novel bifunctional enzyme, L-rhamnulose-phosphate aldolase (RhaE) fused to L-lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (RhaW), which is not homologous to previously characterized L-Rha catabolic enzymes, was identified in diverse bacteria including Chloroflexi, Bacilli, and Alphaproteobacteria. By using in vitro biochemical assays we validated both enzymatic activities of the purified recombinant RhaEW proteins from Chloroflexus aurantiacus and Bacillus subtilis. Another novel enzyme of the L-Rha catabolism, L-lactaldehyde reductase (RhaZ), was identified in Gammaproteobacteria and experimentally validated by in vitro enzymatic assays using the recombinant protein from Salmonella typhimurium. C. aurantiacus induced transcription of the predicted L-Rha utilization genes when L-Rha was present in the growth medium and consumed L-Rha from the medium. This study provided comprehensive insights to L-Rha catabolism and its regulation in diverse Bacteria.

PCC 7002 was grown to steady state in optically thin turbidostat cultures under conditions for which light quantity and quality was systematically varied by modulating the output of narrow-band LEDs. Cells were provided photons absorbed primarily by chlorophyll (680 nm) or phycocyanin (630 nm) as the organism was subjected to four distinct mono- and dichromatic regimes. During cultivation with dichromatic light, growth rates were generally proportional to the total incident irradiance at values <275 Î¼mol photons mâ2 Â· sâ1 and were not affected by the ratio of 630:680 nm wavelengths. Notably, under monochromatic light conditions, cultures exhibited similar growth rates only when they were irradiated with 630 nm light; cultures irradiated with only 680 nm light grew at rates that were 60â70% of those under other light quality regimes at equivalent irradiances. The functionality of photosystem II and associated processes such as maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport, rate of cyclic electron flow, and rate of dark respiration generally increased as a function of growth rate. Nonetheless, some of the photophysiological parameters measured here displayed distinct patterns with respect to growth rate of cultures adapted to a single wavelength including phycobiliprotein content, which increased under severely light-limited growth conditions. Additionally, the ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I increased ~40% over the range of growth rates, although cells grown with 680 nm light only had the highest ratios. These results suggest the presence of effective mechanisms which allow acclimation of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 acclimation to different irradiance conditions.

Leptolyngbya sp. JSC-1 was recently shown to photoacclimate to far-red light by extensively remodeling its photosystem (PS) I, PS II and phycobilisome complexes, thereby gaining the ability to grow in far-red light. A 21-gene photosynthetic gene cluster (rfpA/B/C, apcA2/B2/D2/E2/D3, psbA3/D3/C2/B2/ H2/A4, psaA2/B2/L2/I2/F2/J2) that is specifically expressed in far-red light encodes the core subunits of the three major photosynthetic complexes. The growth responses to far-red light were studied here for five additional cyanobacterial strains, each of which has a gene cluster similar to that in Leptolyngbya sp. JSC-1. After acclimation all five strains could grow continuously in far-red light. Under these growth conditions each strain synthesizes chlorophylls d, f and a after photoacclimation, and each strain produces modified forms of PS I, PS II (and phycobiliproteins) that absorb light between 700 and 800 nm. We conclude that these photosynthetic gene clusters are diagnostic of the capacity to photoacclimate to and grow in far-red light. Given the diversity of terrestrial environments from which these cyanobacteria were isolated, it is likely that FaRLiP plays an important role in optimizing photosynthesis in terrestrial environments.

Over 3 days, we deployed an array of scientific tools through the SLW borehole: a downhole camera, a conductivityâtemperatureâdepth (CTD) probe, a Niskin water sampler, an in situ filtration unit, three different sediment corers, a geothermal probe and a geophysical sensor string. Our observations confirm the existence of a subglacial water reservoir whose presence was previously inferred from satellite altimetry and surface geophysics. Subglacial water is about two orders of magnitude less saline than sea water (0.37â0.41 psu vs 35 psu) and two orders of magnitude more saline than pure drill meltwater (<0.002 psu). It reaches a minimum temperature of â0.55Â°C, consistent with depression of the freezing point by 7.019 MPa of water pressure. Subglacial water was turbid and remained turbid following filtration through 0.45 Î¼m filters. The recovered sediment cores, which sampled down to 0.8 m below the lake bottom, contained a macroscopically structureless diamicton with shear strength between 2 and 6 kPa. Our main operational recommendation for future subglacial access through water-filled boreholes is to supply enough heat to the top of the borehole to keep it from freezing.

This high altitude (1,800 m) reservoir is well-mixed in summer, but becomes strongly stratiï¬ed under ice cover (mid-Novemberâmid-May). A rapid drop in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and rise in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration was observed after the onset of ice, with a corresponding increase in Î´18O-DO and decrease in Î´13C-DIC, likely caused by respiration (R) of organic carbon. Photosynthesis/respiration ratios (P/R) estimated from simultaneous measurement of DO and Î´18O-DO were near unity prior to ice formation but then systematically decreased with time and depth in the lake under ice cover. P/R in the water column was higher at a shallower monitoring site compared to a deeper site near the dam outlet, which may have been important for over-winter survival of salmonids. By March, the bottom 3 m of the water column at both sites was anoxic, with the bottom 1 m being euxinic. Elevated concentrations of dissolved sulï¬de, ammonium, phosphate, Fe2+, and Mn2+ in deep water suggest coupling of organic carbon degradation with reduction of a number of electron acceptors (e.g., Fe3+,NO3-, SO24-). The concentrations and Î´34S values of H2S in the deep water and SO2i in the shallow water were similar, indicating near-complete reduction of sulfate in the euxinic zone. Late in the winter, an inï¬ux of isotopically heavy DIC was noted in the deep water coincident with a buildup of dissolved CH4 to concentrations >1 mM. These trends are attributed to acetoclastic methanogenesis in the benthic sediments. This pool of dissolved CH4 was likely released from the lake to the atmosphere during spring ice-off and lake turnover.	['science', 'microbiology', 'biology', 'life sciences']

The initial stage of hailstone formation (i.e., the embryo) and the subsequent layered growth allow hail to be used as a model for the study of nucleation processes in precipitation. By virtue of the preserved particle and isotopic record captured by hailstones, they represent a unique form of precipitation that allows direct characterization of the particles present during atmospheric ice nucleation. Despite the ecological and economic consequences of hail storms, the dynamics of hailstone nucleation, and thus their formation, are not well understood. Our experiments show that hailstone embryos from three Rocky Mountain storms contained biological ice nuclei capable of freezing water at warm, subzero (Â°C) temperatures, indicating that biological particles can act as nucleation sites for hailstone formation. These results are corroborated by analysis of Î´D and Î´18O from melted hailstone embryos, which show that the hailstones formed at similarly warm temperatures in situ. Low densities of ice nucleation active abiotic particles were also present in hailstone embryos, but their low concentration indicates they were not likely to have catalyzed ice formation at the warm temperatures determined from water stable isotope analysis. Our study provides new data on ice nucleation occurring at the bottom of clouds, an atmospheric region whose processes are critical to global climate models but which has challenged instrument-based measurements.

The nearly ubiquitous presence of FeâS clusters and the fundamental requirement for FeâS clusters in both aerobic and anaerobic Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya suggest that these clusters were likely integrated into central metabolic pathways early in the evolution of life prior to the widespread oxidation of Earthâs atmosphere. Intriguingly, FeâS cluster-dependent metabolism is sensitive to disruption by oxygen because of the decreased bioavailability of ferric iron as well as direct oxidation of sulfur trafficking intermediates and FeâS clusters by reactive oxygen species. This fact, coupled with the ubiquity of FeâS clusters in aerobic organisms, suggests that organisms evolved with mechanisms that facilitate the biogenesis and use of these essential cofactors in the presence of oxygen, which gradually began to accumulate around 2.5 billion years ago as oxygenic photosynthesis proliferated and reduced minerals that buffered against oxidation were depleted. This review highlights the most ancient of the FeâS cluster biogenesis pathways, the Suf system, which likely was present in early anaerobic forms of life. Herein, we use the evolution of the Suf pathway to assess the relationships between the biochemical functions and physiological roles of Suf proteins, with an emphasis on the selective pressure of oxygen toxicity. Our analysis suggests that diversification into oxygen-containing environments disrupted iron and sulfur metabolism and was a main driving force in the acquisition of accessory Suf proteins (such as SufD, SufE, and SufS) by the core SufBâSufC scaffold complex. This analysis provides a new framework for the study of FeâS cluster biogenesis pathways and FeâS cluster-containing metalloenzymes and their complicated patterns of divergence in response to oxygen.

Improve the accuracy and privacy of web analytics reporting on digital library use 2. Recommend an assessment framework and web metrics that will help evaluate digital library performance to eventually enable impact studies of IR on author citation rates and university rankings. Libraries routinely collect and report website and digital collection use statistics as part of their assessment and evaluation efforts. The numbers they collect are reported to the librariesâ own institutions, professional organizations, and/or funding agencies. Initial research by the proposed research team suggests the statistics in these reports can be grossly inaccurate, leading to a variance in numbers across the profession that makes it difficult to draw conclusions, build business cases, or engender trust. The inaccuracy runs in both directions, with under reporting numbers as much a problem as over reporting. The team is also concerned with the privacy issues inherent in the use of web analytics software and will recommend best practices to assure that user privacy is protected as much as possible while libraries gather data about use of digital repositories. Institutional Repositories have been in development for well over a decade, and many have accumulated significant mass. The business case for institutional repositories (IR) is built in part on the number of downloads of publications sustained by any individual IR. Yet, preliminary evidence demonstrates that PDF and other non-HTML file downloads in IR are often not counted because search engines like Google Scholar bypass the web analytics code that is supposed to record the download transaction. It has been theorized that Open Access IR can help increase author citation rates, which in turn may affect university rankings. However, no comprehensive studies currently exist to prove or disprove this theory. This may be due to the fact that such a study could take years to produce results due to the publication citation lifecycle and because few libraries have an assessment model in place that will help them to gather data over the long term. We plan to recommend an assessment framework that will help libraries collect data and understand root causes of unexplained errors in their web metrics. The recommendations will provide a foundation for reporting metrics relevant to outcomes based analysis and performance evaluation of digital collections and IR.

However, native plant and animal species within these shrubland systems are increasingly exposed to human-caused wildfires and an expansion of the humanâwildland interface. Few data exist to evaluate the effects of fire and anthropogenic pressures on plant and animal communities found in these environments. This is particularly true for carnivore communities. To address this knowledge gap, we collected detectionânon-detection data with motion-sensor cameras and track plots to measure carnivore occupancy patterns following a large, human-caused wildfire (1134 km2) in eastern San Diego County, California, USA, in 2003. Our focal species set included coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). We evaluated the influence on species occupancies of the burned environment (burn edge, burn interior and unburned areas), proximity of rural homes, distance to riparian area and elevation. Gray fox occupancies were the highest overall, followed by striped skunk, coyote and bobcat. The three species considered as habitat and foraging generalists (gray fox, coyote, striped skunk) were common in all conditions. Occupancy patterns were consistent through time for all species except coyote, whose occupancies increased through time. In addition, environmental and anthropogenic variables had weak effects on all four species, and these responses were species-specific. Our results helped to describe a carnivore community exposed to frequent fire and rural human residences, and provide baseline data to inform fire management policy and wildlife management strategies in similar fire-prone ecosystems.

Despite the similarities between these two types of hydrogenases, they clearly have distinct evolutionary origins and likely emerged from different selective pressures. [FeFe]-hydrogenases are widely distributed in fermentative anaerobic microorganisms and likely evolved under selective pressure to couple hydrogen production to the recycling of electron carriers that accumulate during anaerobic metabolism. In contrast, many [NiFe]-hydrogenases catalyze hydrogen oxidation as part of energy metabolism and were likely key enzymes in early life and arguably represent the predecessors of modern respiratory metabolism. Although the reversible combination of protons and electrons to generate hydrogen gas is the simplest of chemical reactions, the [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases have distinct mechanisms and differ in the fundamental chemistry associated with proton transfer and control of electron flow that also help to define catalytic bias. A unifying feature of these enzymes is that hydrogen activation itself has been restricted to one solution involving diatomic ligands (carbon monoxide and cyanide) bound to an Fe ion. On the other hand, and quite remarkably, the biosynthetic mechanisms to produce these ligands are exclusive to each type of enzyme. Furthermore, these mechanisms represent two independent solutions to the formation of complex bioinorganic active sites for catalyzing the simplest of chemical reactions, reversible hydrogen oxidation. As such, the [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases are arguably the most profound case of convergent evolution.

In this paper, a selective activation strategy is studied in order to alleviate the issue of added compliance in the intrinsic cohesive zone model applied to arbitrary crack propagation. This strategy proceeds by first inserting cohesive elements between bulk elements and subsequently tying the duplicated nodes across the interface using controllable multi-point constraints before the analysis begins. Then, during the analysis, a part of the multi-point constraints are selectively released, thereby reactivating the corresponding cohesive elements and allowing cracks to initiate and propagate along the bulk element boundaries. The strategy is implemented in Abaqus/Standard using a user-defined multi-point constraint subroutine. Analysis results indicate that the strategy significantly alleviates the added compliance problem and reduces the computation time.

A global approach was initially undertaken to construct the ""transcriptome"" for the Toxoplasma intermediate life cycle using serial-analysis-of-gene expression (SAGE). From this analysis, we confirmed the increased expression of known as well as novel mRNAs associated with the tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite transition. Accumulation of bradyzoite specific mRNAs in the bradyzoite SAGE libraries raises the possibility that transcriptional mechanisms play a key role in the developmental switch. To investigate this question, we adapted the dual luciferase model to recombinational cloning in order to construct a high throughput model for testing and mapping multiple bradyzoite promoters. Expression of luciferase from constructs matched previously published results indicating that developmental gene expression in Toxoplasma is controlled by elements contained in the 5'-flanking regions upstream of the protein coding regions. Promoter cis-elements from two genes, BAG1 and B-NTPase, have been fine mapped to 6-8 bp. EMSA assays confirm that these elements form sequence specific protein/DNA complexes. These data suggest that gene proximal cis-elements are required to initiate developmental gene expression, most likely by the binding of gene-specific trans-acting factors. Although strategies to identify these putative trans factors such as yeast one-hybrid are ongoing, we describe here a more global approach to identifying controllers of gene expression. We conducted an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping project that combines the power of Affymetrix microarray technology and QTL mapping to explore the genetic basis of differences in stage-specific gene expression in Type I versus III parasite strains and in F1 progeny from the I X III cross. Gene expression QTLs discovered in this analysis were either local or non-local to the associated transcriptional change and reflect proximal cis-mutations, transcription factors or central mechanisms that co-regulate gene expression during tachyzoite differentiation. Additionally, we identified segmental duplication events in various parents and progeny of the Type I X III cross that have a gene dosage effect on the level of gene expression in those parasites."

Results: To facilitate the serological investigation, sera were collected from 104 sheep in 2013 and 2014 and assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test using all six BUN serogroup viruses known to occur in the United States: Cache Valley virus (CVV), Lokern virus (LOKV), Main Drain virus (MDV), Northway virus, Potosi virus and Tensaw virus. BUN serogroup virus-specific antibodies were detected in 41 (39%) sheep. Of these, three were seropositive for MDV, one was seropositive for CVV, one was seropositive for LOKV and 36 had antibodies to an undetermined BUN serogroup virus. Additionally, 30,606 Culicoides sonorensis were collected in 2013 using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps and assayed for cytopathic virus by virus isolation in African Green Monkey kidney (Vero) cells. All midges were negative. Almost one-third of the midges were further tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using BUN serogroup virus-reactive primers and all were negative. Conclusions: We provide evidence of BUN serogroup virus infection in sheep but not C. sonorensis in Montana in 2013-2014. This study also provides the first evidence of CVV, MDV and LOKV activity in Montana.	['life sciences', 'microbiology', 'biology', 'science', 'virology']

A modified LockhartâMartinelli (LM) approach based on unique water introduction through the gas diffusion layer is used here to predict the gasâliquid pressure drop in these channels by modifying the Chisholm parameter C. This paper exclusively uses experimental data of two-phase flow multipliers from four sources in the literature, all of which are obtained from active fuel cell operation. C does not appear to change strongly as a function of temperature, relative humidity, or air stoichiometry, but does vary significantly with the current density. This is especially true at low current densities (<500 mA cmâ2). To capture this behavior, C is defined as a flow regime dependent parameter based on a flow regime map from the active fuel cell data. In addition to the traditionally used slug, film, and single-phase regimes, an âaccumulatingâ flow regime is proposed to capture the behavior of C and two-phase flow multipliers at low current densities. The proposed accumulating flow regime is consistent with visual observation reported in the literature. In addition, the developed LM approach can be employed to optimize fuel cell flow field design and operation.

The goal of this study was to assess components of vulnerability of tree species and biome types to projected future climate within the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GNLCC) in the US Northern Rockies and the ecosystems surrounding Glacier and Yellowstone/Grand Teton National Parks. We drew on the results of five published studies and analyzed current and projected future climate suitability for 11 tree species and 8 biome types under two IPCC emissions scenarios. We assessed components of vulnerability based on four metrics of current and projected future climate suitability. Results for biome types indicated largely a shift from climates suitable for alpine and subalpine conifer to climates suitable for desert scrub and grassland types. Results from the four studies of tree species indicated substantial loss of area of climate suitability for the four subalpine species by 2100. This was especially true for Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). Suitable climate for this species dropped from just over 20% of the study area in the reference period to 0.5â7.0% by 2070â2100 under the A2 scenario. The studies agreed in projecting expansion of climate suitability for some montane tree species but disagreed on expansion of climate suitability of west-side mesic tree species to eastside locations such as Yellowstone National park. Importantly, the rankings of tree species vulnerability were similar among studies, scenarios, and geographic areas and indicated highest vulnerability for Whitebark pine and Mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). The results should help federal managers in the GNLCC prioritize tree species for climate adaptation strategies. Moreover, our methods for using published data as a basis for climate vulnerability assessment can be applied within other LCCs across the US and other management units internationally.

The chromosphere and transition region (TR) form an interface region between the surface and the corona that is highly sensitive to the coronal heating mechanism. High-resolution observations with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) reveal rapid variability (~20 to 60 seconds) of intensity and velocity on small spatial scales (â²500 kilometers) at the footpoints of hot and dynamic coronal loops. The observations are consistent with numerical simulations of heating by beams of nonthermal electrons, which are generated in small impulsive (â²30 seconds) heating events called âcoronal nanoflares.â The accelerated electrons deposit a sizable fraction of their energy (â²1025 erg) in the chromosphere and TR. Our analysis provides tight constraints on the properties of such electron beams and new diagnostics for their presence in the nonflaring corona.

With the help of fluorescent microscopy and image analysis, naturally detaching cells and clusters from single species and dual species biofilms of Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown in biofilm tubing reactors were analyzed for cluster size distributions and compared to the cluster sizes in chemostat cultures. The commonly used oxidizing agents free chlorine, chlorine dioxide and dissolved ozone were used for disinfection experiments and susceptibilities of detached clusters, planktonic cells, and intact biofilms in single species and dual species cultures were determined. Additionally, disinfection rates were calculated for chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection for all sample types and species. In experiments with chlorine as the disinfectant, a correlation between cluster sizes and disinfection efficacy was observed for single species only. Samples with the higher percentage of large clusters were more tolerant than samples with fewer large clusters. Chemostat samples and detached clusters from dual species reactors contained lower numbers of large clusters but were equally or less susceptible than their single species counterparts. Biofilms required chlorine doses up to ten times higher than chemostat or detached biofilm cells for total inactivation. Chlorine dioxide disinfection was independent of cluster size so that chemostat cells and detached clusters were similar with respect to log reductions and disinfection rates. Dual species chemostat cells, detached clusters, and biofilms were more tolerant to chlorine dioxide than the single species samples. As with chlorine, biofilms required much higher chlorine dioxide doses for total inactivation. Ozone was very efficient against B. cepacia chemostat cells and detached clusters but failed to inactivate biofilm samples with the concentrations used in this study. In general, detached clusters were more similar to chemostat cells and very different from biofilms with respect to disinfection susceptibilities and disinfection rates suggesting that biofilm-specific physical and physiological protection mechanisms may be lost shortly after the detachment event or may be absent in small clusters.

Over the past few decades, this paradigm shifted for the chromosphere and corona that constitute the outer atmosphere, which is now considered a dynamic structured envelope. Recent observations by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) reveal that it is difficult to determine what is up and down, even in the cool 6000-kelvin photosphere just above the solar surface: This region hosts pockets of hot plasma transiently heated to almost 100,000 kelvin. The energy to heat and accelerate the plasma requires a considerable fraction of the energy from flares, the largest solar disruptions. These IRIS observations not only confirm that the photosphere is more complex than conventionally thought, but also provide insight into the energy conversion in the process of magnetic reconnection.

High-resolution (0.33âarc second) observations with NASAâs Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) reveal a chromosphere and TR that are replete with twist or torsional motions on subâarc second scales, occurring in active regions, quiet Sun regions, and coronal holes alike.

Researchers and government agencies have advocated for quantitative weight-of-evidence approaches in which multiple lines of evidence can be considered when estimating risk. Therefore, we utilized Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo to integrate several human-health risk assessment, biomonitoring, and epidemiology studies that have been conducted for two common insecticides (malathion and permethrin) used for adult mosquito management to generate an overall estimate of risk quotient (RQ). The utility of the Bayesian inference for risk management is that the estimated risk represents a probability distribution from which the probability of exceeding a threshold can be estimated. The mean RQs after all studies were incorporated were 0.4386, with a variance of 0.0163 for malathion and 0.3281 with a variance of 0.0083 for permethrin. After taking into account all of the evidence available on the risks of ULV insecticides, the probability that malathion or permethrin would exceed a level of concern was less than 0.0001. Bayesian estimates can substantially improve decisions by allowing decision makers to estimate the probability that a risk will exceed a level of concern by considering seemingly disparate lines of evidence.

The growing use of tree rings in carbon-cycle research is being facilitated by increasing recognition of reciprocal benefits among research communities. Yet, basic questions persist regarding what tree rings represent at the ecosystem level, how to optimally integrate them with other data streams, and what related challenges need to be overcome. It is also apparent that considerable unexplored potential exists for tree rings to refine assessments of terres-trial carbon cycling across a range of temporal and spatial domains. Here, we summarize recent advances and highlight promising paths of investigation with respect to (1) growth phenology, (2) forest productivity trends and variability, (3) CO2 fertilization and water-use efficiency, (4) forest disturbances, and (5) comparisons between observational and computational forest productivity estimates. We encourage the integration of tree-ring data: with eddy-covarian measurements to investigate carbon allocation patterns and water-use efficiency; with remotely sensed observations to distinguish the timing of cambial growth and leaf phenology; and with forest inventories to develop continuous, annually-resolved and long-term carbon budgets. In addition, we note the potential of tree-ring records and derivatives thereof to help evaluate the performance of earth system models regarding the simulated magnitude and dynamics of forest carbon uptake, and inform these models about growth responses to (non-)climatic drivers. Such efforts are expected to improve our understanding of forest carbon cycling and place current developments into a long-term perspective.

Ecological impacts resulting from these changes are now being observed at all ecosystem levels and larger deviations and more significant impacts are anticipated in the future. Satellite data show dramatic reductions in the extent and thickness of sea ice at both poles, and rising temperatures are causing alpine glaciers worldwide to shrink in area and volume. By virtue of their relatively rapid growth rates and metabolic diversity, we can expect microorganisms to be the ï¬rst responders to ï¬uctuating climatic conditions. Because microorganisms are keystone players in elemental transformations, variations in their abundance and diversity will initiate a cascade of impacts throughout entire ecosystems. Clearly, knowledge of the distribution, biodiversity and functional roles of microorganisms inhabiting polar and alpine environments is essential to our under-standing of ecosystem processes in a changing climate.

This is in part because intracellular processes reveal themselves as specific temporal patterns of variation in metabolite abundance that can be detected with existing signal processing algorithms. Although metabolite abundance levels can be quantified by mass spectrometry (MS), large-scale real-time monitoring of metabolite abundance has yet to be realized because of technological limitations for fast extraction of metabolites from cells and biological fluids. To address this issue, we have designed a microfluidic-based inline small molecule extraction system, which allows for continuous metabolomic analysis of living systems using MS. The system requires minimal supervision, and has been successful at real-time monitoring of bacteria and blood. Feature-based pattern analysis of Escherichia coli growth and stress revealed cyclic patterns and forecastable metabolic trajectories. Using these trajectories, future phenotypes could be inferred as they exhibit predictable transitions in both growth and stress related changes. Herein, we describe an interface for tracking metabolic changes directly from blood or cell suspension in real-time.	['science', 'materials science', 'physical sciences']

Large anomalies were found in the Brillouin shift and linewidth in the [100] and [001] phonons. These anomalies are interpreted as arising from the linear coupling of the polarization and the phonons. From the temperature where the linewidth is maximum, the relaxation time of the polarization fluctuations is estimated to be Ï=3.1Ã10â12/(Tc-T) sec, where Tc is the ferroelectric transition temperature. We also observed anomalies in Brillouin shift and linewidth of the [010] phonons which propagate along the ferroelectric b axis. These anomalies are interpreted as coming from electro- strictive coupling. The energy-relaxation time was estimated to be ÏE=2.5Ã10â10/(T-Tc) sec in the paraelectric phase and ÏE=1.0Ã10â9/(Tc-T) sec in the ferroelectric phase, by comparing our Brillouin results with those of the ultrasonic measurements.

Service learning is a pedagogical approach where students apply skills they learn in a classroom to a real-world problem identified by a community organization. In 2009, a service learning project was introduced in an undergraduate Ergonomics Industrial Engineering course composed of engineering and nonengineering students at Montana State University (MSU). Its integration and development in the existing course required creating a detailed project description and finding a partner organization. Students worked with clients or staff at the partner organization to develop ergonomic solutions for workplace health and safety issues and manufacturing productivity. At the end-of-semester presentations, the community partners, instructor, and other students assessed each solution's effectiveness. These assessments found that students, compared to the partner's feedback, undervalued their prototypes with regard to how they improved worker and process efficiency, and they overvalued their solution's creativity, cost, and implementation feasibility. In addition, the service learning course's technical and professional skills ranked above the average ABET course outcomes of MSU's Industrial Engineering fall courses. This demonstrates how the service learning project and the intended goals from ABET and Engineer 2020 come togetherâservice learning exposes students to real-world situations that better prepare and inform them of the skills that will be needed after graduation.

For different-frequency phonons along the same direction, analogous anomalies in the sound velocity and the attenuation are seen. The smallest angle we have achieved is 7.48Â°. The temperature and frequency dependences of the sound velocity are discussed. The fact that the linewidth maximum for [001] phonons occurs somewhat below Tc seems to indicate that the anomalies are due to piezoelectric coupling induced by spontaneous polarization below Tc. For [010] phonons the elementary relaxation times which relate to the energy are estimated as ÏE0=5.25Ã10â13 sec above Tc and ÏE0=3.32Ã10â12 sec below Tc. The phonon attenuations are also estimated and compared with the observed ones. For the [001] phonons the elementary relaxation time is estimated as Ï0=5.25Ã10â14 sec, in good agreement with the value obtained from right-angle Brillouin scattering.

While integrated pest management emphasizes the need to consider the ecological context where multiple species coexist, management recommendations are often based on single-species tactics. This approach may not provide satisfactory solutions when confronted with the complex interactions occurring between organisms at the same or different trophic levels. Replacement of the single-species management model with more sophisticated, multi-species programs requires an understanding of the direct and indirect interactions occurring between the crop and all categories of pests. We evaluated a modeling framework to make multi-pest management decisions taking into account direct and indirect interactions among species belonging to different trophic levels. We adopted a Bayesian decision theory approach in combination with path analysis to evaluate interactions between Bromus tectorum (downy brome, cheatgrass) and Cephus cinctus (wheat stem sawfly) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) systems. We assessed their joint responses to weed management tactics, seeding rates, and cultivar tolerance to insect stem boring or competition. Our results indicated that C. cinctus oviposition behavior varied as a function of B. tectorum pressure. Crop responses were more readily explained by the joint effects of management tactics on both categories of pests and their interactions than just by the direct impact of any particular management scheme on yield. In accordance, a C. cinctus tolerant variety should be planted at a low seeding rate under high insect pressure. However as B. tectorum levels increase, the C. cinctus tolerant variety should be replaced by a competitive and drought tolerant cultivar at high seeding rates despite C. cinctus infestation. This study exemplifies the necessity of accounting for direct and indirect biological interactions occurring within agroecosystems and propagating this information from the statistical analysis stage to the management stage.

Given their global importance for sport and subsistence hunting, viewing and ecosystem functioning, great effort has been devoted since the middle part of the 20th century to understanding both the environmental and demographic mechanisms that influence waterfowl population and community dynamics. Here we use comparative approaches to summarise and contrast our understanding of waterfowl population dynamics across species as short-lived as the teal Anas discors and A.crecca to those such as the swans Cygnus sp. which have long life-spans. Specifically, we focus on population responses to vital rate perturbations across life history strategies, discuss bottom-up and top-down responses of waterfowl populations to global change, and summarise our current understanding of density dependence across waterfowl species. We close by identifying research needs and highlight ways to overcome the challenges of sustainably managing waterfowl populations in the 21st century.

This analysis uses data from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to evaluate the relationship between behavioral, economic, and demographic factors with BMI while explicitly accounting for systematic heterogeneity using a quantile regression. Results suggest that the effect of exercise, smoking, occupation, and race vary by sizeable amounts from high to low BMI-quantiles. This strongly indicates that future research efforts and policy responses to obesity need to account for these differences in order to develop more effective policies.

They must somehow conflate two contradictory elements: natural science information and compelling storytelling. Looking at the roots of classical narrative, we can better understand why audiences have come to crave it. Broadcast television, in turn, caters to audience desire. This combination forces filmmakers to present natural science information in an exciting way, and has led filmmakers to employ time-honored narrative structures as organizing strategies. While audiences seem to favor material presented this way, it calls the accuracy of the natural science presented into question. This paper will explore how and why the use of narrative became common to natural science filmmaking, illustrate the inherent incompatibilities between the narrative and natural science, and consider the repercussions of this filmmaking model.

Geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is a method by which point source CO 2 emissions are purified and deposited in subsurface geologic formations for long-term storage. Accompanying this technology is the inherent responsibility to monitor these large-scale subsurface reservoirs for CO 2 leaks to ensure safety to local environments and inhabitants, as well as to alleviate global warming. Elevated CO 2 levels in soil are known to cause anoxic conditions in plant roots, thereby interfering with plant respiration and inducing a stress response that could possibly be remotely sensed using aerial imagery. Airborne remote sensing technology has the potential to monitor large land areas at a relatively small cost compared to alternative methods. In 2010, an aerial campaign was conducted during the height of the growing season to obtain an image time series that could be used to identify and characterize CO 2 stress in vegetation from a simulated CO 2 leak. An unsupervised classification was performed to classify CO 2 stressed vegetation as a result of the subsurface injection. Furthermore, a spectral index was derived to amplify the CO 2 stress signal and chart vegetation health trajectories for pixels affected by the CO 2 release. A theoretical framework was developed for analysis strategies that could be implemented to detect a CO 2 leak using aerial hyperspectral imagery with minimal a priori knowledge. Although aerial detection of CO 2 stressed vegetation was possible while no other physiological plant stressors were present, the spectral distinction between vegetation stress agents would have important implications for the appropriate timing that GCS monitoring using remote sensing data could commence. A greenhouse experiment was devised to compare the spectral responses of alfalfa plants to CO 2 and water stress in order to reveal whether CO 2 leak detection is possible when soil water availability is highly variable or during periods of drought. Spectral discernment of a CO 2 leak appears to be possible when soil water is spatially variable and during moderate drought conditions with remote sensing instruments that are sensitive to reflectance in the short wave infrared, where water absorption features related to leaf water content occur.

Terrific Telescopes was implemented in eight middle-school classrooms and reached 166 students during the 2010 to 2011 school year. As part of the project, we conducted a teacher workshop and assessed student learning outcomes and teachersâ experiences with the curriculum. The goals of our assessments were to improve our understanding of how students learn key optics-related principles, provide evidence of the learning outcomes of Terrific Telescopes, and find out how teachers adapt the curriculum for use in formal settings.

The current study used longitudinal daily diary data from a sample of college students attending a large public university in the Northeastern US (n = 726, Mage = 18.4) that was followed for 14 days within each of 7 semesters (for up to 98 diary days per student). The study had two primary aims. The first aim was to explore demographic correlates of employment time, organized activity time, and academic time. The second aim was to provide a rigorous test of the time trade-off hypothesis, which suggests that students will spend less time on academics when they spend more time on employment and extracurricular activities. The results demonstrated that time use varied by gender, parental education, and race/ethnicity. Furthermore, the results from multi-level models provided some support for the time trade-off hypothesis, although associations varied by the activity type and whether the day was a weekend. More time spent on employment was linked to less time spent on academics across days and semesters whereas organized activities were associated with less time on academics at the daily level only. The negative associations between employment and academics were most pronounced on weekdays. These results suggest that students may balance certain activities across days, whereas other activities may be in competition over longer time frames (i.e., semesters).

Data from these lakes have been collected annually for more than 25 years, and are cataloged in the McMurdo Dry Valley Long Term Ecological Research database. The objectives of the current study were to determine whether turbidity stratification patterns could be identified within the four McMurdo Dry Valley Lakes, to look for seasonal and annual changes in those stratification patterns, and to correlate environmental data to identify potential causes of the turbidity. To identify patterns in turbidity, extinction coefficient depth profiles were calculated using photosynthetically active radiation data collected annually during the past 29 years. Averaging the profiles revealed distinct stratification of turbidity layers that were shown to be relatively stable across all recorded years. To examine potential causes of turbidity revealed by the extinction coefficient data, chlorophyll-a profiles were compiled for the same years, and compared to those of the extinction coefficients. Within the photic zones of Lake Hoare and East and West Lobe Bonney, chlorophyll-a was significantly correlated with turbidity. A linear plot of extinction coefficients against time revealed that later season average turbidity is much higher than that of early season turbidity, and that turbidity increases with depth in the photic zones of all lakes. Future research focusing on stream flow data could help identify the causes of the increase in late season turbidity observed in this study, and analysis of environmental data other than chlorophyll could help to determine what other phenomena control turbidity gradients in Lakes Fryxell and Hoare.

This paper introduces an LPM integrated electric power dispatch algorithm to minimize the overall production cost over a given period under study by considering both fuel cost and emission factors. A Newton-like particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been developed to implement the LPM integrated optimal power dispatch. The proposed Newton-like method is embedded into the PSO algorithm to help handle equality constraints while penalty/fitness functions are used to deal with inequality constraints. In addition to illustrative example applications of the proposed Newton-like PSO technique, the optimization method has been used to realize the LPM integrated optimal power dispatch for the IEEE RTS 96 system. Simulation studies have been carried out for different scenarios with different levels of load management. The simulation results show that the LPM can help reduce generation costs and emissions. The results also verify the effectiveness of the proposed Newton-like PSO method.	['science', 'computer engineering', 'computer science']

Systems biology enables the construction of complex models describing such interactions, leading to a better understanding of disease states and communities. However, before interactions between complex organisms can be understood, metabolic and energetic implications of simpler real-world host-microbe systems must be worked out. To this effect, untargeted metabolomics experiments were conducted and integrated with proteomics data to characterize key molecular-level interactions between two hyperthermophilic microbial species, both of which have reduced genomes. Metabolic changes and transfer of metabolites between the archaea Ignicoccus hospitalis and Nanoarcheum equitans were investigated using integrated LCâMS and NMR metabolomics. The study of such a system is challenging, as no genetic tools are available, growth in the laboratory is challenging, and mechanisms by which they interact are unknown. Together with informa-tion about relative enzyme levels obtained from shotgun proteomics, the metabolomics data provided useful insights into metabolic pathways and cellular networks of I. hosp-italis that are impacted by the presence of N. equitans, including arginine, isoleucine, and CTP biosynthesis. On the organismal level, the data indicate that N. equitans exploits metabolites generated by I. hospitalis to satisfy its own metabolic needs. This finding is based on N. equi-tansâs consumption of a significant fraction of the metab-olite pool in I. hospitalis that cannot solely be attributed to increased biomass production for N. equitans. Combining LCâMS and NMR metabolomics datasets improved cov-erage of the metabolome and enhanced the identification and quantitation of cellular metabolites.

Our knowledge of how A. fumigatus growth is controlled in the respiratory tract is developing, but still limited. Alveolar macrophages, lung resident macrophages, and airway epithelial cells constitute the first lines of defense against inhaled A. fumigatus conidia. Subsequently, neutrophils and inflammatory CCR2+ monocytes are recruited to the respiratory tract to prevent fungal growth. However, the mechanism of neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the respiratory tract after A. fumigatus exposure remains an area of ongoing investigation. Here we show that A. fumigatus pulmonary challenge induces expression of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18 within the first 12 hours, while IL-1Î± expression continually increases over at least the first 48 hours. Strikingly, Il1r1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to pulmonary A. fumigatus challenge exemplified by robust fungal proliferation in the lung parenchyma. Enhanced susceptibility of Il1r1-deficient mice correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment and anti-fungal activity. Importantly, IL-1Î± rather than IL-1Î² was crucial for optimal leukocyte recruitment. IL-1Î± signaling enhanced the production of CXCL1. Moreover, CCR2+ monocytes are required for optimal early IL-1Î± and CXCL1 expression in the lungs, as selective depletion of these cells resulted in their diminished expression, which in turn regulated the early accumulation of neutrophils in the lung after A. fumigatus challenge. Enhancement of pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and anti-fungal activity by CXCL1 treatment could limit fungal growth in the absence of IL-1Î± signaling. In contrast to the role of IL-1Î± in neutrophil recruitment, the inflammasome and IL-1Î² were only essential for optimal activation of anti-fungal activity of macrophages. As such, Pycard-deficient mice are mildly susceptible to A. fumigatus infection. Taken together, our data reveal central, non-redundant roles for IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² in controlling A. fumigatus infection in the murine lung.

A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator & floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., â¼1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.

However, these parameters are critical for accurate population assessments and understanding of population dynamics. Using mark recapture observations at white shark foraging aggregation sites, we tested for differences in survival between sexes and estimated apparent survival for sub-adult and adult white sharks in neritic waters off central California. We used 6 years of mark-recapture data and a model that accounted for imperfect detection and imperfect sex assignment. Empirical information based on direct observations suggests that there are no sex-specific or temporal differences in survival during the study period and that survival was estimated to be 0.90; SE = 0.04. Additionally, after animals whose sex was unknown throughout the study period were probabilistically assigned to sex, the ratio in this sample is estimated to be 2.1 males for every female observed. This estimated ratio is lower than the observed ratio of 3:1. We demonstrate that the estimated capture probability for males was roughly twice as high as that for females (0.41, SE = 0.06 and 0.19, SE = 0.07 respectively). Together these results suggest (1) that the sex ratio is uneven but not as skewed as uncorrected observation data would suggest and (2) that unequal mortality in older age classes are not the cause of the observed sex bias but more likely results from disparate mortality earlier in life or differences in behavior. Future research is needed to explore the potential causes of the observed sex bias.	['life sciences', 'ecology', 'environmental sciences', 'biology', 'science']

We argue that violating this âmodesty normâ by boasting about oneâs accomplishments causes women to experience uncomfortable situational arousal that leads to lower motivation for and performance on a self-promotion task. We hypothesized that such negative effects could be offset when an external source for their situational arousal was made available. To test hypotheses, 78 women students from a U.S. Northwestern university wrote a scholarship application essay to promote the merits of either the self (modesty norm violated) or another person as a letter of reference (modesty norm not violated). Half were randomly assigned to hear information about a (fake) subliminal noise generator in the room that might cause âdiscomfortâ (misattribution available) and half were told nothing about the generator (normal condition: misattribution not available). Participants rated the task and 44 new naive participants judged how much scholarship money to award each essay. Results confirmed predictions: under normal conditions, violating the modesty norm led to decreased motivation and performance. However, those who violated the modesty norm with a misattribution source reported increased interest, adopted fewer performance-avoidance goals, perceived their own work to be of higher quality, and produced higher quality work. Results suggest that when a situation helps women to escape the discomfort of defying the modesty norm, self-promotion motivation and performance improve. Further implications for enhancing womenâs academic and workplace experiences are discussed.

Experiment 1 used exclusion instructions in which participants were told to avoid completing the stem (e.g. mo---) with a word related to a masked prime (e.g. cash) flashed for 0, 38, or 212 ms. Significant semantic priming was found only in the items analysis when data was averaged across participants. In the subjects analysis, this performance was moderated by participantsÎ± ability to report the prime. Experiment 2 used a free association task to examine unconscious semantic priming. Participants were instructed to respond to a target homograph (e.g. pupil) with the first word that came to mind that is not related to the meaning of the flashed word (e.g. student). No significant unconscious semantic priming was found. Experiment 3 replicated the conditions previously used to demonstrate unconscious semantic priming and show that such priming is due to methodological problems. The same methodology as Experiment 2 was used except participants were given inclusion instead of exclusion instructions. Significant priming was found across all trials; however, this priming dissolved when only the trials where participants failed to report the prime were examined. The results of all experiments suggest that unconscious semantic priming from word stimuli is a result of residual conscious awareness of the prime.

In this process, microbial activity is promoted that increases pore water alkalinity. When calcium or other divalent cations are supplied to the system, solid carbonate minerals can form which occupy pore space and can decrease permeability. Permeability reduction can also come from microbial biofilms forming in the pore space. The goal of the work presented in this dissertation is to understand how pore space is affected, both physically and chemically, by biofilms and the precipitates that they can form. Fundamental research presented here is intended to inform ongoing application-based research and development. Previously it has been a challenge to image MICP at high resolution without the use of destructive techniques. To overcome that obstacle, a fluorescently-tagged bacterium capable of urea hydrolysis-driven MICP was constructed. Biofilms were grown in two-dimensional microscale porous media reactors and allowed to precipitate calcium carbonate under varied conditions. These reactors were imaged noninvasively using confocal microscopy so that both biofilms and carbonate minerals could be resolved at micrometer resolution. Image analysis was utilized to quantify how much pore space was occupied by the biofilm and minerals in order to estimate porosity reduction. Finally, pore-scale reactive transport modeling was utilized in order to estimate local concentrations within the reactors. The results show that the extent to which the porosity and permeability of the porous medium was decreased depended on when the calcium was added to the system. Also, periods of low flow were found to decrease porosity and permeability to a greater extent. This result adds to the evidence that a pulsed flow injection strategy may be most effective for permeability reduction via MICP in the subsurface. Additionally, reactive transport modeling predicts a heterogeneous mineral saturation environment at the pore-scale which highlights the challenge of predicting precipitation behavior in Darcy-scale reactive transport models.

While the development of critical thinking skills has long been a goal of education, and is thought to be even more critical in the world of the 21st century, there is evidence to suggest it is not an easy outcome to realize. It is unknown whether todays pre-service teachers are prepared to encourage and support the development of critical thinking skills in the k-8 classroom. This mixed methods study explores the perceptions of elementary pre-service teachers with regard to their personal application of critical thinking skills and their ability to promote the development and application of critical thinking skills in a k-8 classroom. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from participants who were enrolled in an elementary social studies methods course. Data collection included a self-reporting survey of everyday critical thinking, a document analysis of civics and government lesson plans, and face to face interviews. These three different data points help build a complete picture of the ways in which critical thinking is or is not promoted in elementary classrooms. The results demonstrated that pre-service elementary teachers believe themselves to be critical thinkers at least some of the time, however, few critical thinking skills were required in the lesson plans designed by participants. While the interviews help to shed some light on the reasons, the study is not conclusive in this area. The study certainly reinforces the idea that critical thinking is a complex and abstract idea - difficult to define, measure or teach at any age level.

Today, Montana oil production predominantly occurs in the state's eastern half within the Williston Basin. However, state commercial oil development began in the small community of Cat Creek in central Montana in 1920, and oil production began in eastern Montana during the 1930s. Early decades of oil production in both central and eastern Montana engendered community infrastructure and identity shifts away from agriculture toward oil. However, Cat Creek oil production during the 1920s was more equitable for homesteaders than in eastern Montana because central Montana development began in the hands of locally operated companies and homesteaders rather than large corporations. Furthermore, homesteaders who remained in eastern Montana for the advent of early Williston Basin oil production settled under authorities that separated mineral from surface resource rights. Both factors resulted in central Montanans' comparatively positive collective memory of oil production. Oil is sunlight energy converted into social and economic capital. In both central and eastern Montana, homesteaders shaped, and were shaped by, oil as a finite energy resource.

These projects seek to improve the safety of drinking water at the school, increase school attendance and performance and decrease time spent collecting water in these communities. Data were collected from 776 households in Khwisero in order to measure the organization's impact. Instrumental variable methods are used to analyze EWB-MSU's impact on health outcomes, while fixed effect analysis is used to investigate the impact on education and time-use outcomes. No impact is detected on student health or education due to EWB-MSU projects but households surrounding EWB-MSU water projects spend almost one minute fewer, on average, traveling to their primary water source relative to other households.

Psychological research demonstrates that goals can remain active across time until they are fulfilled, even unconsciously and, presumably, passively. Yet, recent research suggests that unfulfilled goals require effort to maintain, drawing upon the limited pool of executive resources and interfering with executive control. If true, the logic follows that unfulfilled goals should compromise executive control initially following goal activation and after a delay. However, another possibility is that the executive control deficits resulting from an unfulfilled goal are due to the initial mobilization of effort required to activate the goal in the first place, and that executive control is only compromised initially following goal activation and not after a delay. To test these competing predictions, participants in two reported experiments received a goal to form impressions of roommates in an upcoming experimental task, or no goal. Next, participants engaged in an unrelated task that required the inhibition of a prepotent response (i.e., executive control). Performance on this task is dependent on the availability of executive resources, as one needs these resources to successfully inhibit a prepotent response. In addition, participants engaged in this task either immediately after goal (or no goal) activation, or after a few-minute pause. The results of both experiments indicate that the impression formation goal had no effect on executive control immediately or after a pause. The proposition that unfulfilled goals occupy executive resources is likely complicated by moderating variables, as a simple yet effective goal manipulation in the current experiments did not compromise executive resources.

PLCs are a concept and a structure through which schools can address and respond to the myriad social, political, and technological forces that educators face today. By utilizing principal leadership responsibilities associated with second order change as a basis for identifying the needs of PLCs, data was gathered to analyze and inform principals in how to determine the needs of their PLCs. Such information can then be used to develop a school improvement plan to meet PLCs at their current level of functioning, and focus on addressing the specific needs of each PLC in a targeted manner that employs differentiated leadership designed by principals to positively impact teaching and learning. The purpose of this embedded case study was to examine how teachers and principals describe the influence of principal leadership responsibilities on PLCs. The case study was conducted at a class AA high school in Montana consisting of five principals, 95 teachers, and approximately 1830 students in the initial years of PLC implementation. The primary sources of data collection were: teacher and principal focus group interviews, document analysis, researcher's journal, and the use of archival collective efficacy data. Findings suggest the importance of clear ideals and beliefs; an emphasis on the need for principals to support teachers in differing ways; varying interpretations of principal leadership responsibilities between PLCs as well as between principals and teachers; and various levels of PLC functioning. As principals seek to develop and implement continual school improvement plans to enhance teaching and learning, they must understand the needs identified by their PLCs and develop a differentiated leadership plan to utilize principals' time, talents, and resources to meet those needs and support positive PLC functioning. Recommendations are made for further research.	['ability', 'leadership']

Historical knowledge among youth is often below the proficiency level is U.S. history according to national performance measures. Research suggests that an experiential approach to history education that allows for hands-on activities, group work, use of creativity, role playing, and self-directed learning can positively influence youth interest in history. This study investigated the effects of participatory living history methodologies on youth interest in the history of American frontier. The program utilized in this research was the 4-H Western Heritage Project in Montana and Missouri where youth become living historians through period dress, skills, activities, and mannerisms. A post-test/retrospective pre-test survey was used to measure changes in interest among 4-H members after at least one year of participation in the 4-H Western Heritage Project compared to their retrospectively recorded perceptions before participation. Respondents also rated the primary experiential teaching methodologies found within the project. A paired samples t-test was conducted to determine any significant differences between the mean scores of 4-H members before and after participation. The calculation of descriptive statistics reported ratings of primary experiential methodologies. Positive and significant differences were found in levels of interest from before participation and after at least one year's participation in participatory living history methodologies. Self-directed learning, hands-on activities, group learning, the use of creativity, and role playing through historic character development were each identified by survey respondents as beneficial to learning history. This research suggests that participatory living history methodologies increase youth interest in learning American frontier history. Results may be applicable to museum education programs, living history sites, history camps, and potentially the traditional classroom.

In this study, markers of oxidative stress and lymphocyte subpopulations in mice were observed following sub-acute exposure to metals-containing dust collected from a natural setting used heavily for off-road vehicle (ORV) recreation. Adult female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to concentrations of dust collected from seven types of surfaces at the Nellis Dunes Recreation Area. Dust representing each of the seven map units was prepared with a median diameter of < or = 4.5m and suspended in PBS immediately prior to oropharyngeal aspiration at concentrations from 0.01 - 100 mg of dust/kg body weight. Four exposures were given a week apart over 28-days to mimic a month of weekend exposures. Thymi, spleens and blood for evaluation of oxidative stress markers and lymphocyte sub-populations were collected 24 hours after the final exposure. Blood markers of oxidative stress included levels of free radicals, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, and total glutathione. CD4, CD8, FoxP3, CD25, IL-17, and B220 cell surface markers were used for T and B cell identification using flow cytometry. Overall, no single surface type was able to consistently induce markers of oxidative stress at a particular dose or in a dose-responsive manner. The two highest concentrations of dust from one surface type increased two markers of oxidative stress, but results of other surface types were inconsistent. No statistically significant changes were observed in the splenic B220+ cells following NDRA dust exposure. Three CBN units (1, 2, and 6) showed decreases in splenic CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3- cells. These observations were relatively consistent with TiO 2, where a significant change at the highest exposure level was observed in only one measure of oxidative stress. Additionally, the TiO 2 dosing groups showed no significant changes in lymphocyte subpopulations. These results indicate that exposure to these natural, mineral dusts, under the exposure scenario of our study, while are unlikely to considerably increase the risk of oxidative damage systemically, may induce a reduction in some cell populations in exposed individuals.

Although limited discussion exists in the literature about the political participation of school leaders (Crow & Weindling, 2010; Milstein & Jennings, 1972) and political engagement is called for in the Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium Standards for School Leaders standards (Council of Chief State School Officers, 1996), few studies have examined the types of activities educational leaders engage in politically nor the effectiveness of those activities in influencing policy outcomes. This study examines, through the lens of stakeholder theory, the historical context of the relationship between politics and education, the current status of the relationship, and the reasons for school leaders' hesitancy to engage in political affairs. It also examines the considerations of the legislature and their perceptions on effective engagement, to better understand and consider future efforts of educational leaders to influence policy. The quantitative study includes electronic surveys of school leaders, legislators, and education stakeholders to identify effective methods of political engagement, using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, and open coding of open response questions to answer the following research questions: 1) What were the most effective methods of legislative engagement and interaction utilized by educational leaders during the 2013 legislative session in Montana? 2) Was there a difference between engagement activities reported prior to the 2013 session? Responses were also compared with prior study results, legislator responses, and to one another for inter-rater reliability and triangulation. The most effective activities school leaders engaged in were specific conversations with legislators regarding education issues, and both written and in person testimony. The results demonstrate a need for school leaders to align their engagement efforts more closely with activities deemed effective by legislators, though there were significant differences in the activities reported during the 2013 session. Conclusions include the need for school leaders to overcome barriers to engagement, for increased stakeholder participation and policy community engagement, and for further research.

Today, the paradigm shift is focused on inquiries of form and function, with filmmakers pushing against the current boundaries of the genre. Historically, narrative and documentary have been thought of as distinct forms, but there are many films being produced today that fall somewhere in between. Films that are merging style and format from both fiction and non-fiction are referred to as hybrid documentaries or creative nonfiction. As part of this current trend, what I refer to as performative non-fiction is one subgenre that has evolved from the present desire to broaden the non-fiction film form. After identifying the defining characteristics of performative non-fiction films, I explore three case studies, 'The Act of Killing' (2012), 'Bombay Beach' (2011), and 'I'm Still Here' (2010), as well as my own film, 'A Decay of Control' (2015), to illustrate how their use of performance is changing the way information is conveyed in the documentary, representing one route of epistemological expansion of the medium.

Criteria are established for the form: It should be less than feature length. It must have text. The text must represent a single voice, and the speakers attempt to work out some reasoned line of discourse on a problem. The text must have a strong personal point of view. The text's language should be as eloquent and interesting as possible. Three films are analyzed that illustrate the essay film form: Chris Marker's 'Letter from Siberia', Cindy Stillwell's 'Mating For Life', and Werner Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. I conclude that the essay film form is a viable alternative to traditional documentary filmmaking styles. It is particularly useful in specific historical, social, and political contexts as a means of influencing public opinion and advocating for change.

Horizontal violence is defined as ""hostile, aggressive, and harmful behavior by a nurse or group of nurses toward a coworker or group of nurses via attitudes, actions, words and/or behaviors"" (Thobaben, 2007, p. 82). A study conducted in 2003 and repeated in 2013 by the Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) found a persistent culture of HV tolerance and indifference in healthcare settings. Horizontal violence is closely related to retention of both seasoned and new graduate nurses, a serious concern in the current and looming nursing shortage. This project investigated possible policy implications related to horizontal violence in nursing by increasing an understanding of the supportive role of hospital policies. Procedures for this project included (a) a review of current HV literature, (b) a request for policies on HV, workplace violence, harassment, bullying and/or codes of conduct/ethics from 10 hospitals (both critical access and non-critical access) in Montana, and (c) analysis of the policies using an evidence-based grid. Out of the ten hospitals of various sizes contacted, there was a 50% response/participation rate. Of the five hospitals that responded, none had policies specific to horizontal violence. Three hospitals had workplace violence policies and two hospitals had no policies on HV or any related key words. Findings indicate a clear need for further study with a larger hospital sample and an improved policy retrieval process to better understand the presence or absence HV healthcare policies. Use of the evidence-based grid developed for this project could serve as a useful tool for hospitals interested in creating a policy directly related to HV in nursing and a mechanism for consciously developing and enforcing cultures of respect in the workplace."

70252	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9077	The effects of face-to-face and online peer feedback on business students' perceptions of quality and effectiveness	"Deficiencies existed in recent research studies examining the use of peer feedback in business-communication writing courses--both face-to-face and online. The purpose of this research study was to provide current educators with a better understanding of the benefits, as well as the limitations, of using formative peer feedback as a strategy to improve collaborative student learning and course-objective outcomes among students in business-writing courses at Montana State University. This mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study was designed to investigate business-communication students' perceptions of using formative peer feedback to assist them with their assignments in both face-to-face and online learning environments. Three classes of students enrolled in an introductory business-communication writing course engaged in both online and face-to-face peer feedback conditions for two class assignments. Other data sources included a 2008 Lizzio and Wilson questionnaire to assess participants' perceptions of their feedback experience in face-to-face and online feedback conditions, course grades, and individual as well as group interviews. The data analysis process used multiple methodologies to integrate, analyze, and interpret findings. Analysis of data consisted of analyzing online surveys, and individual and focus-group questionnaires resulted in the coding of student response statements. From online surveys, questionnaires, audiotaped interviews, and instructor observations, response data categories were initialized and synthesized into associated themes for further analysis. Results for both the positive and negative message show that, overall, students ""agreed"" that the feedback was developmental in that it helped them to improve, and was encouraging and fair. However, students overall disagreed with statements related to inconsistency of feedback, difficulty reading marker's comments, difficulty understanding feedback, and unknown grading expectations. Students' interview comments further suggested that, through the online process, it was difficult to fully understand marker's comments related to certain aspects of the assignments. Future research should continue to examine the use of online peer feedback as an assessment formative method. Furthermore, it is suggested that such research first focus on effective protocols that simplify the peer-to-peer feedback process so that students view the online feedback procedure as a fair and equitable form of assessment."

As more homeschoolers enroll in higher education, colleges are taking notice of potential opportunities and obstacles they bring to campus from their homeschool experience. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to gain an understanding of how homeschool students perceived their experiences contributing to academic and social integration in college. Eleven state university and nine community college students participated in personal, face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions providing opportunity for students to tell the story of their personal homeschool experiences. Two themes evolved from the interviews as influential to integration: homeschool platform and student learning characteristics. Student learning characteristics consisted of self-discipline, independence, memorization, organization, and respect functioning as both obstacles and opportunities to college integration. Homeschool platform evolved from one-on-one instruction to student self-instruction, allowing flexibility to engage in self-discovery experiences developing capital with similar and diverse individuals. These relationships helped transition to academic and social integration. A sense of belonging was a product of the relationships built through integration and contributed to student engagement and satisfaction. Data showed homeschool students come to college with student learning characteristics to self-instruct, ability to develop relationships through respect, and gain respect from peers because of their morals and values. Relationships with individuals sharing similar interests provided students confidence to enroll in early start college courses to better understand college expectations. Limitations of the homeschool experience as students transitioned to college included: working in group projects, peer relationships with diverse individuals, and college expectations. Working on group projects caused anxiety for students due to their motivation for academic excellence and lack of interpersonal trust to allow peer responsibility of projects. Uncertainty of college expectations became evident as students enrolled in college with limited experience outside homeschool education. Students lacked experience using text books, taking notes, lectures, schedules, and inability to progress at their own pace. As homeschool students enter higher education, institutions have the capacity to address obstacles and opportunities they bring to campus to enhance their college experience.

Previous literature has explored hurricanes' impacts on growth in coastal counties of the United States, but not the inherently linked effects of anti-price gouging (APG) laws, which prohibit firms from significantly increasing prices during a declared state of emergency. The relationship between APG laws and economic growth following a hurricane is estimated with a fixed effect model and county-level quarterly wage data for the period 1990-2012. Results suggest that hurricane-stricken counties are worse off in the presence of APG laws, with the most pronounced negative effects in the accommodations industry. The deleterious effects of APG laws, however, are short-lived; affected counties appear to rebound once the laws are no longer in effect. As the first paper to empirically examine the economic effects of APG laws, these results counter common political thinking and provide empirical support of standard economic theory regarding price ceilings.

Although there is substantial research on chemical pollutant remediation by TW, the removal of bacterial pathogens is much more varied and limited in scope. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a bacterial pathogen that has caused numerous outbreaks and infections in the United States alone and is closely associated with improper water treatment. Understanding how E. coli O157:H7 could potentially persist and survive through a TW process is important in order to appropriately determine the efficacy of TW for treating water and protecting human health. This work used epifluorescent microscopy and qPCR relative DNA abundance to track E. coli O157:H7 tagged with a fluorescent DsRed protein in various environments pertaining to a TW. Two high performing wetland plant species, Carex utriculata and Schoenoplectus acutus, were used in hydroponic and simulated TW columns to better understand how the bacteria localize and persist. Teflon nylon strings (diameter 0.71-1.02 mm), cleaned and with established biofilm, were run hydroponically as control inert surfaces. Unplanted gravel columns were used as a nonplanted control for column experiments. E. coli O157:H7-DsRed were observed by microscopy on root surfaces both in hydroponic reactors and lab scale TW columns. The organisms persisted, forming microcolonies shortly after initial inoculation on both root and nylon surfaces. In the lab scale columns, cells persisted for three weeks, although strong biofilm formation was not observed. qPCR also provided evidence that E. coli O157:H7 was able to persist on the tested surfaces of plant roots, nylon inert surfaces, and gravel, showing higher abundance S. acutus roots than on the inert surface and gravel, however higher in unplanted gravel overall. For the plant types, C. utriculata was statistically lower for E. coli O157:H7 abundance than S. acutus over time. This work provides evidence that E. coli O157:H7 is able to colonize and persist in a TW environment, and plant surfaces may offer a higher inactivation than an inert matrix.

One project focuses on understanding the role IL-2 plays in immune response regulation and exploring how these effects can be altered. We developed several dynamic models of the receptor signaling network which we analyze analytically and numerically. In a second project focused also on MS, we sought to create a system for grading magnetic resonance images (MRI) with good correlation with disability. The goal is for these MRI scores to provide a better standard for large-scale clinical drug trials, which limits the bias associated with differences in available MRI technology and general grader/participant variability. The third project involves the study of the CRISPR adaptive immune system in bacteria. Bacterial cells recognize and acquire snippets of exogenous genetic material, which they incorporate into their DNA. In this project we explore the optimal design for the CRISPR system given a viral distribution to maximize its probability of survival. The final project involves the study of the benefits for colocalization of coupled enzymes in metabolic pathways. The hypothesized kinetic advantage, known as 'channeling', of putting coupled enzymes closer together has been used as justification for the colocalization of coupled enzymes in biological systems. We developed and analyzed a simple partial differential equation of the diffusion of the intermediate substrate between coupled enzymes to explore the phenomena of channeling. The four projects of my thesis represent very distinct biological problems that required a variety of techniques from diverse areas of mathematics ranging from dynamical modeling to statistics, Fourier series and calculus of variations. In each case, quantitative techniques were used to address biological questions from a mathematical perspective ultimately providing insight back to the biological problems which motivated them.

Mentoring student leadership by guiding students in skills, practices and behaviors is a topic that has the potential to take student success to a more rigorous and relevant level for all learners (Magner, SoulÃ© & Wesolowski, 2011). This study was intended to reveal how participation in programs that mentor leadership contributes to the development of the portraits of the Common Core State Standards (Wilhoit, 2010) in students. Since 21st century skills have been combined with the Common Core State Standards for the purposes of student achievement in a variety of literature, the researcher cross-referenced these and developed a working model of mentoring student leadership utilizing: 1. Leadership practices (Kouzes & Posner, 2006) 2. Identity leadership theory behaviors (Haslam, Reicher & Platow, 2011) 3. 21st century skills (McGaw, 2009) 4. Portraits of the Common Core State Standards (Wilhoit, 2010) Student leaders and adult mentors were the participants in this multiple case study: high school pupils who experience specific mentoring in student leadership and teachers who mentor these students. Through interviews, observations, and document analysis, programs that offer a prescribed framework orchestrating the development of leadership were examined. Lack of research in mentoring student leadership was investigated through the study. By exploring two high school programs that guide adolescents through a formal framework, it was possible to witness a snapshot of the development of student leadership. Although the student groups studied were diverse, five similarities were discovered when student leadership was mentored : citizenship, communication, collaboration (Griffin, McGaw & Care, 2010), representing the group (Nohria & Khurana, 2010), and modeling the way for others (Kouzes & Posner, 2008). Utilizing an existing mentoring model (Rhodes, 2002), a new model for mentoring leadership was structured and is still being developed. Viable information gathered about developing student leadership and adolescent success suggests expanding the study outside of the high school examined to other communities and states. If a goal in education is to increase student success through leadership development, exploring other influences on student leadership will be valuable as a next step in facilitating progressive education.

Yet by analyzing scientific imaginations as they interacted with the materiality of western landscapes, this dissertation argues that the history of the American West was equally influenced by the discovery of the watery deep past of its paleo-landscapes. The physical geography and remnant resources generated through geologic time in the American West decisively influenced western settlement and the advancement of American science in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Through government reports, scientists breathed new life into the ancient denizens and environments of the West. Where others saw an eternal and timeless desert, many scientists saw a plastic and ever-evolving environment. Boosters absorbed the authority of their science to lend credence to visions of a plastic West that would once again become a verdant paradise. Imagined vibrant paleo-environments portrayed once-and-future fertile landscapes that overrode the dominant perception of the American West as arid and hostile to life. With the power granted by coal paired with new technologies, and the Eden-like scientific visions of a former fertile West, vast human-induced climatological changes became an empowering possibility to a nation driven to settle the West. A ""paleo-restorative dream"" emerged in which the West--by the agency of humans--would return to ancient Edenic landscapes. Indeed, the geoengineering that pervades contemporary discussions concerning climate change and drives hopes to terraform Mars had their origins in the nineteenth century drive to recreate the American frontier."

However, shifting traditional design work earlier in the design process so as to avoid rework later is difficult. A number of product development practices that have been characterized as a shift from developing a single-point design to developing a set of possible designs have proven effective at reducing development rework. This paper refines the definitions of such âset-basedâ development practices, which are aimed at early development phases, and shows how they can be applied to the systems engineering process in order to reduce or eliminate the root causes of rework. Examples from the Wright Brothers, Toyota, and several other companies are presented.

The results from our prospective longitudinal study demonstrated that underrepresented minority student (URM) research assistants who see the altruistic value of conducting biomedical research feel more psychologically involved with their research over time, which, in turn, enhances their interest in pursuing a scientific research career. These altruistic motives are uniquely influential to URM students and appear to play an important role in influencing their interest in scientific research careers. Furthermore, seeing how research can potentially affect society and help one's community does not replace typical motives for scientific discovery (e.g., passion, curiosity, achievement), which are important for all students. These findings point to simple strategies for educators, training directors, and faculty mentors to improve retention among undergraduate URM students in biomedicine and the related sciences.

We investigated the presence and magnitude of PSFs in two contrasting agricultural settings and tested the importance of species identity and phylogenetic relationships in determining PSFs. Methods We compared PSFs that developed from an intensified agricultural site and a nearby non-cultivated pasture. Four weed and seven crop species were grown in soil inoculated with either biologically active or sterilized soils from each system. Four crop response species were grown to estimate PSFs. Results PSFs were species-specific. The identity of currently- and previously-planted species and their interactions explained over 80 % of the variation in feedbacks. Biota from the intensified agricultural site produced negative feedbacks in three of the four response species. Phylogenetic relationships partially explained PSFs. Conclusions PSFs can alter crop growth and may be altered by agricultural practices. The species-specific effect to soil biota should be taken into account when assessing the extent to which crop and weed species could influence subsequent plant growth.

Currently, there is no effective Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy to control for wireworms, due to the diverse number of species that make up complexes in cropland. The purpose of this study was to determine what wireworm species are present in Montana's croplands and develop tools to make species concepts accessible to non-specialists. This was done using DNA barcoding to associate wireworms with adults. DNA barcoding was done by amplifying the Cytochrome-Oxidase I (COI) region of the mitochondrial genome. Twenty-nine (29) species were successfully sequenced and 13 species had adult and larval associations made, including three new associations. In addition, a LUCID pictorial key was also created to help identify species occurring in Montana. A LUCID key is a computer-based key where a user identifies a specimen with the help of pictures of each character. During the wireworm study, one species-group in the genus Limonius was found to include many economic species, including two that are important in Montana. This group needed to be reevaluated due to controversies raised in a recent revision, many of which dealt with economic species. With the combined use of morphological characters and DNA data, eight species are now recognized as belonging to the group. All of these subprojects show the combined use of DNA and morphology as essential to fully understanding wireworm species. With a more precise knowledge of the species that make up the complexes in Montana's croplands, we can focus on developing IPM stratetgies for efficient control.

Wetlands are the largest natural source of CH 4, amounting to 22% of CH 4 production globally, with emission of CH 4-C by both diffusion and ebullition pathways. Permafrost peatlands store about 10% of permafrost C and 5% of global belowground C; hence CH 4- C emission with peatland permafrost thaw is of concern. We quantified temporal and spatial aspects of CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from northern peatlands using two approaches: (1) a ~1000 y thaw chronosequence in remote western Alaska (Innoko Flats Wildlife Refuge; May-September, 2011), and (2) lateral transects in intermediate age (~20-500 y) collapse-scar bog features at a well-instrumented site near Fairbanks, Alaska (Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX)/Bonanza Creek Long Term Experimental Research site; June-September, 2012). At Innoko Flats, peak CH 4 production was observed in features aged 30-590 y since thaw, which had warmer soils than younger sites and shallower water tables than older sites. Average surface flux at these 30-590 y sites (+2.52 Â± 0.98 mg CH 4-C m -2 hr -1) was greater than estimated ebullition flux (0.13 Â± 0.05 mg CH 4-C m -2 hr -1) based on an observed rate of 0.78 Â± 0.33 mL m -2 hr -1. Net ecosystem exchange of CO 2-C (NEE) did not differ among chronosequence features, and offset CH 4-C emissions by a factor of 2 to 400 when considered as 100-y global warming potential. At APEX, bogs reflecting <100 y since most recent thaw showed high variability in CH 4 exchange, but rates were generally consistent with levels at the Innoko 30-590 y sites (mean of 5.42 Â± 1.16 mg CH 4-C m -2 hr -1). APEX bogs showed greater balance between CH 4-C efflux and CO 2-C influx, with CH 4-C fluxes offsetting 80-140% of NEE during the growing season when considered as 100-y global warming potential. We argue that CH 4 contributes most significantly to post-thaw C loss over timescales of decades to centuries in these northern peatlands.

PCC 7002 and the marine facultative aerobe Shewanella putrefaciens W3-18-1 to growth in a co-culture and infer the effect of carbon flux distributions on photoautotrophâheterotroph interactions. The overall transcriptome response of both organisms to co-cultivation was shaped by their respective physiologies and growth constraints. Carbon limitation resulted in the expansion of metabolic capacities, which was manifested through the transcriptional upregulation of transport and catabolic pathways. Although growth coupling occurred via lactate oxidation or secretion of photosynthetically fixed carbon, there was evidence of specific metabolic interactions between the two organisms. These hypothesized interactions were inferred from the excretion of specific amino acids (for example, alanine and methionine) by the cyanobacterium, which correlated with the downregulation of the corresponding biosynthetic machinery in Shewanella W3-18-1. In addition, the broad and consistent decrease of mRNA levels for many Fe-regulated Synechococcus 7002 genes during co-cultivation may indicate increased Fe availability as well as more facile and energy-efficient mechanisms for Fe acquisition by the cyanobacterium. Furthermore, evidence pointed at potentially novel interactions between oxygenic photoautotrophs and heterotrophs related to the oxidative stress response as transcriptional patterns suggested that Synechococcus 7002 rather than Shewanella W3-18-1 provided scavenging functions for reactive oxygen species under co-culture conditions. This study provides an initial insight into the complexity of photoautotrophicâheterotrophic interactions and brings new perspectives of their role in the robustness and stability of the association.

Development of geochemical indicators of ground-ice residence times in permafrost will advance understanding of the circumstances and evidence of permafrost formation, preservation, and thaw in response to climate warming and other disturbance. We used uranium isotopes to evaluate the residence time of segregated ground ice from ice-rich loess permafrost cores in central Alaska. Activity ratios of 234U vs. 238U (234U/238U) in water from thawed core sections ranged between 1.163 and 1.904 due to contact of ice and associated liquid water with mineral surfaces over time. Measured (234U/238U) values in ground ice showed an overall increase with depth in a series of five neighboring cores up to 21 m deep. This is consistent with increasing residence time of ice with depth as a result of accumulation of loess over time, as well as characteristic ice morphologies, high segregated ice content, and wedge ice, all of which support an interpretation of syngenetic permafrost formation associated with loess deposition. At the same time, stratigraphic evidence indicates some past sediment redistribution and possibly shallow thaw among cores, with local mixing of aged thaw waters. Using measures of surface area and a leaching experiment to determine U distribution, a geometric model of (234U/238U) evolution suggests mean ages of up to â¼200 ky BP in the deepest core, with estimated uncertainties of up to an order of magnitude. Evidence of secondary coatings on loess grains with elevated (234U/238U) values and U concentrations suggests that refinement of the geometric model to account for weathering processes is needed to reduce uncertainty. We suggest that in this area of deep ice-rich loess permafrost, ice bodies have been preserved from the last glacial period (10â100 ky BP), despite subsequent fluctuations in climate, fire disturbance and vegetation. Radiocarbon (14C) analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in thaw waters supports ages greater than â¼40 ky BP below 10 m. DOC concentrations in thaw waters increased with depth to maxima of >1000 ppm, despite little change in ice content or cryostructures. These relations suggest time-dependent production of old DOC that will be released upon permafrost thaw at a rate that is mediated by sediment transport, among other factors.

Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions that produce epileptic activities. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study, as part of a Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project, which utilizes in vivo electrophysiologically-characterized human brain samples from the neocortex of 6 patients with refractory epilepsy, to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. This study is unique in that comparison of protein expression was made within same patient, between nearby epileptic and non-epileptic (or less epileptic) brain regions, as defined by their interictal (between seizure) spike frequencies. Protein spots were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using two-dimensional differential-in-gel-electrophoresis, revealing 31 spots that changed significantly and were identified by liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels showed strong negative correlation with spiking frequency. We next developed a two-step analysis method to select for frequently changing spots among the patients and identified 397 of those proteins. Spots of interest were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. This analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial and vascular changes and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections that provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.

Elevated nitrate concentrations in shallow unconfined aquifers are commonly observed in agricultural areas as a result of increased N inputs. In the Judith River Watershed (JRW) in central Montana, USA, notably high nitrate concentrations in groundwater and stream water have exceeded the U.S. EPA drinking water standard of 10 mg L -1 for at least two decades. This large (24,400 ha) watershed drains immediately into the Missouri River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. Over an eleven month period in 2012, we measured groundwater and surface water nitrate concentrations across a hydrologically isolated strath terrace. We use the resulting data to constrain nitrate accumulation dynamics in the shallow aquifer. Nitrate is relatively conservative in this location, as it is high in groundwater (17.57 +/- 4.29 mg L -1; all groundwater samples pooled together), and remains high in streams and springs that drain the landform (15.67 +/- 9.45 mg L -1; all surface water and spring samples pooled together). We use a numerical model to simulate the character of nitrate accumulation in the aquifer as a whole, in order to evaluate how the entire period of cultivation has contributed to current nitrate concentrations, and begin to predict response times for effects of land use change. We consider the effect of groundwater residence time and travel time on nitrate loading using particle tracking in a three dimensional model aquifer. We find no correlation with nitrate concentrations in groundwater and emerging surface waters, and suggest approaches for improving both the geometry of the model and the selection of sites in future work. Overall, our results imply that groundwater residence times are several decades at most, suggesting that similar timeframes will be needed to reduce overall nitrate concentrations in groundwater and emergent streams to below drinking water standards. Preliminary evaluation of several management scenarios suggests that both increased fertilizer use efficiency and rotational strategies may be needed to prevent the loss of soil N to groundwater.

The high mortality rates associated with severe invasive diseases are particularly concerning. GAS strains isolated from patients with severe invasive infections frequently display hypervirulence, but the basis for this hypervirulence is not fully understood. The objective of this project is to elucidate the underlying mechanism behind this hypervirulent phenotype in a serotype M3 STSS isolate, MGAS315. A comparative study of MGAS315 and a serotype M28 puerperal sepsis isolate, MGAS6180, revealed that MGAS315 has a substantially higher capacity to invade soft tissue and inhibit neutrophil recruitment than MGAS6180 in a murine model of subcutaneous infection. Deletion of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase gene sse reduced MGAS315 skin invasion and innate immune evasion. These results cannot be explained by the proposal that the hypervirulence of MGAS315 is due to the acquisition of additional prophage-encoding virulence factors. SsE is negatively regulated by the two-component regulatory system CovR/S, and MGAS315 has a CovS G457V mutation compared with the covS gene of the serotype M1 isolate MGAS2221. We hypothesize that the CovSG457V mutation is responsible for the hypervirulence of MGAS315. To test this hypothesis, the mutated covS gene in MGAS315 was replaced with wild-type covS, resulting in MGAS315wtcovS. The mRNA levels of CovR/S-controlled capsule synthase gene hasA and the IL-8 peptidase gene spyCEP in MGAS315wtcovS were 24% and 3% of those in MGAS315, respectively. Repairing the covS mutation in MGAS315 also reduced the PAF acetylhydrolase activity in the culture supernatant and SsE production as measured by western blotting analysis. These results indicate that the CovSG457V mutation enhanced the expression of CovR/S-controlled virulence factors. More importantly, repairing the CovS G457V mutation attenuated the innate immune evasion, skin evasion, and virulence during infection. Collectively, this work demonstrates the CovS G457V mutation increases virulence factor expression and enhances innate immune evasion, thereby contributing to the hypervirulence of MGAS315.

This is because the patient-subject of a sleep disorder documentary falls within a unique nexus of controlling power structures and gazes that are rooted in medical sociology, documentary filmmaking ethics, and the sociology of sleep. Relying on past scholarship on medical documentaries in general, I identify three themes that signal disenfranchisement of the patient-subject: when authority of knowledge rests with the doctor and/or the filmmaker, when the doctor is active while the patient-subject is passive, and when the patient-subject is exposed to voyeurism. I then analyze three sleep disorder documentaries for how well they maintain patient-subject agency.

As medicinal chemists enamored by how structure imparts biological function, we found it to have strikingly similar structure to the antitubercular imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxyamides. Zolpidem was found to have antituberculosis activity (MIC of 10â50 Î¼M) when screened against replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv. Manipulation of the Zolpidem structure, notably, to structural isomers (âanagramsâ), attains remarkably improved potency (5, MIC of 0.004 Î¼M) and impressive potency against clinically relevant drug-sensitive, multi- and extensively drug-resistant Mtb strains (MIC < 0.03 Î¼M). Zolpidem anagrams and analogues were synthesized and evaluated for their antitubercular potency, toxicity, and spectrum of activity against nontubercular mycobacteria and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These efforts toward the rational design of isomeric anagrams of a well-known sleep aid underscore the possibility that further optimization of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine core may well âput TB to restâ.

These programs seek to complement established food- and agriculture-related courses of instruction with additional curricular elements that build studentsâ capacity to address complex food-systems issues (e.g., food sustainability, security, quality, equity and justice) in the course of their work in food-related professions. Here, we examine these emerging food-systems curricula, building on our collective experiences developing food-systems degree programs at University of British Columbia, Montana State University, University of California-Davis and the University of Minnesota. We present the conceptual framework that underlies our efforts, based on the premise that our degree programs should help students build âsystemicâ capacities that complement disciplinary training provided by various specialization âtracks.â Thus, we intend for our graduates to have a dual preparation, in both a particular specialization, and in overarching systemic capacities that enhance their ability to address complex food-system issues. We assess our current curricula in light of our framework, and outline high-priority pathways for further development of these curricula.

70276	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9119	An integrative approach to understanding bird origins	Recent discoveries of spectacular dinosaur fossils overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that birds are descended from maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs, and furthermore, demonstrate that distinctive bird characteristics such as feathers, flight, endothermic physiology, unique strategies for reproduction and growth, and a novel pulmonary system originated among Mesozoic terrestrial dinosaurs. The transition from ground-living to flight-capable theropod dinosaurs now probably represents one of the best-documented major evolutionary transitions in life history. Recent studies in developmental biology and other disciplines provide additional insights into how bird characteristics originated and evolved. The iconic features of extant birds for the most part evolved in a gradual and stepwise fashion throughout archosaur evolution. However, new data also highlight occasional bursts of morphological novelty at certain stages particularly close to the origin of birds and an unavoidable complex, mosaic evolutionary distribution of major bird characteristics on the theropod tree. Research into bird origins provides a premier example of how paleontological and neontological data can interact to reveal the complexity of major innovations, to answer key evolutionary questions, and to lead to new research directions. A better understanding of bird origins requires multifaceted and integrative approaches, yet fossils necessarily provide the final test of any evolutionary model.

Today they are seen as one of the state's most prized possessions, with millions of dollars spent annually on their sustainability through the management efforts of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Funding for Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks is provided through a hunter and manufacturer sponsored excise equipment tax provided through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program, or as it is more commonly referred to, the Pittman-Robertson Act, as well as state hunter license and permit fees. Conservation efforts provided through these funds are directly and indirectly responsible for increased harvest numbers and hunter participation, as well as the expansion of lands conserved to sustain these wildlife populations. By providing a healthy and diverse variety of game species, the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is able to continually attract hunters to the state. This in turn, increases hunter expenditures that fund additional conservation efforts, while at the same time contributing to local economies via food, lodging, equipment, and transportation expenditures. The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between hunter-supported expenditures by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, hunter participation rates, species' harvest rates, and hunters' economic impact on communities. It is hypothesized that there will exist a positive relationship and feedback the between amount of hunter-related expenditures, hunter participation and harvest rates, and hunters' economic impact on local communities. The importance of this study was to develop a methodology by which these relationships can be determined, and hence, used elsewhere, as well as to demonstrate to regional hunting and non-hunting community, the importance and value of hunting.

Two important goals during this process are to achieve a final fracture with a predefined geometry and to have a proper distribution of proppant material within the fracture to keep the fracture walls open and allow oil and gas to flow to the surface. The hydraulic fracturing system contains limited real-time measurements of the actual fracture conditions largely due to the remote subterranean location where the fracture propagates. The fracturing process is characterized by multiphase transport, proppant settling, and coupling of fluid and fracture growth mechanics, all occurring within a time-varying spatial domain. These features present a challenge for the implementation of online feedback control of the fracture growth and proppant placement, and there are very few accounts of attempting this goal in the open literature. To address these issues, the current work proposes a control strategy that allows for closed-loop model-based control of the hydraulic fracturing process. Previous work introduced a dynamic fracture model capable of describing the fracture propagation, fluid and particle transport, proppant bank formation, and fracture closure processes necessary to determine the fracture state evolution and predict the fractureâs final performance. The QDMC (quadratic-dynamic matrix control) form of model-based control is studied. A particle filter provides a means for effective state estimation due to limited real-time measurements. Controlling the fracture geometry and proppant distribution within a hydraulic fracture is a novel application for real-time model-based control. Results of a numerical study are provided to demonstrate the performance of the closed-loop system.	['applied mathematics']

The central idea behind many designed experiments is to improve or optimize inference about the quantities of interest in a statistical model. Thus, the strengths of any inferences made will be dependent on the choice of the experimental design and the statistical model. Any design that optimizes some statistical property will be referred to as an optimal design. In the main, most of the literature has focused on optimal designs for linear models such as low-order polynomials. While such models are widely applicable in some areas, they are unsuitable as approximations for data generated by systems or mechanisms that are nonlinear. Unlike linear models, nonlinear models have the unique property that the optimal designs for estimating their model parameters depend on the unknown model parameters. This dissertation addresses several strategies to choose experimental designs in nonlinear model situations. Attempts at solving the nonlinear design problem have included locally optimal designs, sequential designs and Bayesian optimal designs. Locally optimal designs are optimal designs conditional on a particular guess of the parameter vector. Although these designs are useful in certain situations, they tend to be sub-optimal if the guess is far from the truth. Sequential designs are based on repeated experimentation and tend to be expensive. Bayesian optimal designs generalize locally optimal designs by averaging a design optimality criterion over a prior distribution, but tend to be sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. More importantly, in cases where multiple priors are elicited from a group of experts, designs are required that are robust to the class (or range) of prior distributions. New robust design criteria to address the issue of robustness are proposed in this dissertation. In addition, designs based on axiomatic methods for pooling prior distributions are obtained. Efficient algorithms for generating designs are also required. In this research, genetic algorithms (GAs) are used for design generation in the MATLABÂ® computing environment. A new genetic operator suited to the design problem is developed and used. Existing designs in the published literature are improved using GAs.

There is a clear clinical need for better asthma management programs in the pediatric primary care setting (Akinbami et al., 2011; Sleath et al., 2011). The current system for asthma management in primary care offices is not improving outcomes for pediatric asthma patients in the United States or the state of Montana. Barriers to providing comprehensive evidence-based pediatric asthma care exist in the primary care setting nationwide (US DHHS, 2010; & Meyer, 2011). The creation of an evidence-based pediatric asthma toolkit for the primary care provider based on the EPR-3 Asthma Diagnosis and Management Guidelines (NIH, NHLBI, 2007) is an attempt to alleviate prevalent barriers primary care providers face in pediatric asthma care. A toolkit was assembled based on literature reviewed, interviews with experts in the field, and suggestions from primary care providers after reviewing the tool. The toolkit was found to be evidence-based, appropriate for use in the primary care setting, efficient for use in a busy primary care setting, and desired for use by primary care providers in the state based on informal interviews and reviews. It is suggested that the Pediatric Asthma Toolkit for the Primary Care Provider be tested using a formal research study for its' effectiveness in improving pediatric asthma care in the primary care setting as well as improving asthma outcomes in the state of Montana. More research needs to be done in the U.S. to evaluate the effectiveness and use of asthma toolkits by primary care providers. The toolkit will need to be updated when new research is published on asthma care as well as when new national asthma guidelines are issued. The toolkit will also need to be updated with current available pharmaceuticals and devices for asthma. This professional project is in alignment with the national Asthma Control Goals for Healthy People 2020 as well as the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommendations for implementation of the EPR-3 Guidelines. It is also in alignment with the Montana Asthma Control Program's goals to create partnerships throughout the state and improve asthma outcomes for Montana.

While modern omics experiments can deliver a high resolution view of an organism's molecular complexity, methods for correlating the information from multiple biomolecular systems (i.e. genes, proteins and metabolites) and their changes over time remain greatly underdeveloped. Presented in this research are: (1) methods for understanding the inter-relation of multiple biomolecular systems correlating genomics, proteomics and metabolomics experiments; (2) techniques for machine learning based metabolic biomarker selection; (3) robotics technology for real-time measurement of changes in metabolism. The methods for correlating information from multiple biomolecular systems have provided a new perspective of biomolecular adaptation and evolutionary relationships in the thermophilic archaea. The techniques for biomarker selection have provided a method to assess the reliability of biomarkers in experiments where limited samples are available. The new technology has provided an engineered system for automated analysis of metabolic patterns and how they change over time. Together, these results have created a framework for future improvement of our understanding of biology through the use of molecular biology, machine learning and robotics.

Thus, its atmospheric concentration and the processes controlling it are important components of the global climate system. Recent research has shown methanogenesis in subglacial sediments. However, the net contribution from subglacial systems to the global methane budget is poorly understood due to a dearth of empirical data. Using measurements via the static chamber method, the flux of methane from recently exposed subglacial sediments at Robertson Glacier, Canadian Rockies was quantified. Methane concentrations were measured from surface gas flux chambers in transects both parallel and perpendicular to the glacier terminus. Over 300 measurements were made during the 2012 melt season (July to September) and used to determine both spatial and temporal variability in the gas fluxes. The chamber farthest from the glacier terminus, approximately 50 m down valley, had an average flux close to zero whereas the chambers nearest the terminus had the highest average fluxes. The average methane efflux from the sediment surface to atmosphere was 0.22 micromoles m -2 d -1. The highest methane efflux during the season, 11.0 micromoles m -2 d -1, was measured in close proximity to the glacier terminus. Shallow sediment cores were collected adjacent to the static chambers and vertical gas concentration profiles were measured from the cores. Within the profiles, methane concentrations were greater than atmospheric concentrations at all depths. Additionally, CO 2, CO and H 2 gas concentrations were analyzed in the cores to evaluate potential microbial metabolic pathways of methane production. Previous studies on methane fluxes from glacial sediments in Greenland and the Swiss Alps used single time point flux measurements during a melt season from multiple locations. This study concludes that such point measurements are unlikely representative for determining a net seasonal flux as they do not consider temporal variability. There was a two order of magnitude difference between the annual source contribution of methane based on the average melt season flux and the highest measured surface flux. This indicates that single sampling periods may significantly over or underestimate the net seasonal flux of methane from recently exposed glacial sediments to the atmosphere.

With the increase in climate temperature, the sea level is rising causing flooding, displacing people from their homes and damaging the water supply causing water-borne illnesses. Warm temperatures are extending the length of transmission seasons for vector-borne illnesses, and variable precipitation is causing damage to food crops affecting the source of nutrition (WHO, 2008). Nurses are often on the front lines of managing illness and injury related to climate change, but, it is unknown to what extent they are prepared to do so. Because basic nursing competencies are achieved in nursing schools, focus on preparation of nursing faculty to prepare nursing students in competencies related to climate change is logical. The purpose of this study is to evaluate professor's knowledge of health impacts due to climate change. In total, 103 nursing faculty were selected from the single university to participate in a survey designed to obtain a general baseline of faculty knowledge regarding health effects associated with climate change. Results: The most recognized health impact related to climate change reported by respondents was flooding-related displacement of residents. They viewed flooding as already increased (n=32, 84%) and expected flooding to continue increasing into the future . Other recognized health impacts due to climate change that respondents believe have already increased and will increase in the next 20 years included air quality related illnesses (already increased 83%, will increase 80%) and disruption of health care services during extreme weather events (already increased 70% will increase 68%) Discussion: In general, when comparing present-day health impacts to those that may occur 20 years from now, faculty believed the incidence of each health impact will increase and very few responses reported the health impacts not increasing over the next 20 years.

Because it provides a non-linear, multidimensional way of exploring a topic it is especially appropriate for use in environmental studies courses, where individuals, institutions, and ecosystems interrelate in complex ways. This project looked at the effect of using concept mapping as a reflective and constructive exercise in an environmental analysis course at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon. A sub-question was whether or not characteristics of certain students, such as ""learning style"" and background proficiency with the subject matter would affect the degree to which concept mapping proved helpful. Students created bi-weekly concept maps to review lessons, reflect on their growth throughout the course, and present the findings of their final group research projects. A sub-group of students completed a questionnaire after each concept mapping exercise, which asked them the degree to which the exercise helped facilitate the educational goals of the course. Overall, concept mapping proved helpful and moderately challenging to the students. In general, demographics, learning style, and other variables did not predict success with concept mapping or success with the course. One notable exception was that the students who felt more challenged by the concept mapping exercises ultimately did better in the course overall. This indicates that for engaged students, concept mapping has the potential to keep them at the optimal level of intellectual discomfort that ultimately fosters deep learning."

Experiments were conducted to further understand; 1) the capillary trapping mechanism that occurs during sequestration of CO 2 in deep underground sandstone reservoirs, 2) the viscous fingering phenomena that occurs when scCO 2 convectively dissolves in brine under reservoir conditions, and 3) flow patterns and fluid mechanisms in immiscible two-phase flow in porous media for the two pressure gradient regimes formed under different capillary numbers. Capillary trapping is a prominent mechanism for initially trapping CO 2 in pore structures of deep underground rock formations during the sequestration process. Because of its significant role in securing CO 2 underground, it is important to characterize and understand the residual saturation and distribution of CO 2 within the pore structure. A setup was developed in which drainage and imbibition of a Berea Sandstone core takes place within an NMR spectrometer under reservoir conditions. NMR results provide comparisons between the different nonwetting fluids used and help characterize the capillary trapping of each nonwetting fluid. In conclusion, scCO 2 is trapped 13% less efficiently than air or CO 2, and the nonwetting fluid is preferentially trapped in larger pores. Viscous fingering is a significant long-term trapping mechanism that further increases storage security by enhancing mass transfer through convective dissolution. A setup was developed in which scCO 2 could dissolve into a water saturated bead pack, under reservoir conditions, within the NMR spectrometer. NMR results track spatial changes in T 2 relaxation time and signal intensity. The results are inconclusive and the phenomena could not be directly observed but results do suggest dissolution is occurring during the experiment. Immiscible two-phase flow in porous media is unpredictable and existent in many industries. Therefore, determining flow patterns and understanding the fluid mechanisms from a capillary number/pressure gradient relationship could prove valuable. A setup was developed in which an immiscible two-phase flow through a bead pack was monitored, for different capillary numbers, with NMR techniques. NMR results provide snapshots of the water saturation distribution within the bead pack. The results suggest there's a consistent slug-type flow pattern during the steady state.

Studies described in this thesis examine the roles these variables have on controlling interfacial behavior, including molecular adsorption and aggregation at solid/liquid interfaces. Specifically, second harmonic generation (SHG) was employed to characterize adsorption environments and adsorption energies at different silica/liquid interfaces, due to the technique's surface specificity. Additionally, time resolved fluorescence was used to quantify emission lifetimes within these same interfacial regions. By systematically changing the substrate, solvent identity, and adsorbate functionality, the impact of each contribution was identified and quantified. Initial studies examined the role played by interfacial pH in controlling adsorption. Above pH 5, silica surfaces become negatively charged and promote two distinct adsorption mechanisms. Adsorption due to these mechanisms requires very long equilibration times (>3hrs). Subsequent experiments studied the role played by solvent identity on interfacial solvation. At a methanol/silica interface a non-polar interfacial environment was produced, independent of solute choice. Non-polar solvents conversely create polar interfacial solvation environments. At these different solid/liquid interfaces, similarly structured coumarin dyes, C151 and C152, were examined. Slight changes in structure lead to differing behaviors at the surface, C151 terminates at monolayer coverage while C152 shows clear signs of multilayer formation. This observation is explained by the difference in hydrogen bonding opportunities for each adsorbate: C151 can accept and donate H-bonds while C152 can only accept H-bonds, resulting in more degrees of freedom for C152 at an interface and thus the possibility of aggregation.

Software design was based on an anticipated cycle of adaptive hypothesis testing, requiring that the model implementation be highly modular, quickly extensible, and easily coupled with hydrologic models in a shared state space. Model testing scenarios were designed to assess the potential for competition over dissolved organic carbon, oxygen, and inorganic nitrogen in simulated batch reactors. Test results demonstrated that the model appropriately weights metabolic processes according to the amount of chemical energy available in the associated biochemical reactions, and results also demonstrated how simulated carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur dynamics were influenced by simultaneous microbial competition for multiple resources. This effort contributes an approach to generalized modeling of microbial metabolism that will be useful for a theoretically and mechanistically principled approach to biogeochemical analysis.

Our objective was to compare economic net returns among wheat-only and peaâwheat systems during an established 4-yr crop rotation. The experimental design included three wheat-only (tilled fallowâwheat, no-till fallowâwheat, no-till continuous wheat) and three no-till peaâwheat (peaâwheat, pea brown manureâwheat, and pea forageâwheat) systems as main plots, and high and low available N rates as subplots. Net returns were calculated as the difference between market revenues and operation and input costs associated with machinery, seed and seed treatment, fertilizer, and pesticides. Gross returns for wheat were adjusted to reflect grain protein at âflatâ and âsharpâ discount/premium schedules based on historical Montana elevator schedules. Cumulative net returns were calculated for four scenarios including high and low available N rates and flat and sharp protein discount/premium schedules. Peaâwheat consistently had the greatest net returns among the six systems studied. Pea fallowâwheat systems exhibited greater economic stability across scenarios but had greater 4-yr returns (US$287 haâ1) than fallowâwheat systems only under the low N rate and sharp protein discount schedule scenario. We concluded that peaâwheat systems can reduce net return uncertainties relative to wheat-only systems under contrasting N fertility regimes, and variable wheat protein discount schedules in southwestern Montana. This implies that peaâwheat rotations, which protected wheat yield and/or protein levels under varying N fertility management, can reduce farmersâ exposure to annual economic variability.

We develop a rational expectations contract decision model that serves as the basis for an empirically informed simulation analysis of malt barley contracting opportunities between Canadian farmers and U.S. maltsters in the deregulated environment. Comparative statics and simulation results indicate that some new opportunities for contracting are possible, but the likelihood of favorable conditions for U.S. maltsters to contract with Canadian rather than U.S. farmers is lowâbetween 9% and 35% over a range of possible selection rates. The effects on contracting of the termination of the Canadian grain transportation revenue cap policy and of the relaxation of criteria for the release of new spring wheat varieties are also investigated. While changes to grain transportation policies are not likely to significantly affect favorable conditions for contracting, reducing constraints on Canadian farmersâ access to higher yielding wheat varieties could increase the returns from growing spring wheat but decrease the likelihood of contracting for malt barley with U.S. maltsters by an average of 5.3 percentage points.

(OR-10) was isolated as an endophyte of Tsuga heterophylla (Western hemlock). Both ITS and 18S sequence analyses indicated that the organism best fits either Hypocrea spp. or Trichoderma spp., but neither of these organisms possess conidiophores associated with acervuli, in which case the endophytic isolate OR-10 does. Therefore, the preferred taxonomic assignment was primarily based on the morphological features of the organism as one belonging to the genus Gloeosporium sp. These taxonomic observations clearly point out that limited ITS and 18S sequence information can be misleading when solely used in making taxonomic assignments. The volatile phase of this endophyte was active against a number of plant pathogenic fungi including Phytophthora palmivora, Rhizoctonia solani, Ceratocystis ulmi, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. Among several terpenes and furans, the most abundantly produced compound in the volatile phase was 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one, a compound possessing antimicrobial activities. When used in conjunction with microliter amounts of any in a series of esters or isobutyric acid, an enhanced inhibitory response occurred with each test fungus that was greater than that exhibited by Gloeosporium sp. or the compounds tested individually. Compounds behaving in this manner are hereby designated âsynergistans.â An expression of the âmedian synergistic effect,â under prescribed conditions, has been termed the mSE50. This value describes the amount of a potential synergistan that is required to yield an additional median 50 % inhibition of a target organism. In this report, the mSE50s are reported for a series of esters and isobutyric acid. The results indicated that isoamyl acetate, allyl acetate, and isobutyric acid generally possessed the lowest mSE50 values. The value and potential importance of these microbial synergistic effects to the microbial environment are also discussed.

A spatial model for vehicle-choice count data	Electric vehicles (EVs) are predicted to increase in market share as auto manufacturers introduce more fuel efficient vehicles to meet stricter fuel economy mandates and fossil fuel costs remain unpredictable. Reflecting spatial autocorrelation while controlling for a variety of demographic and locational (e.g., built environment) attributes, the zone-level spatial count model in this paper offers valuable information for power providers and charging station location decisions. By anticipating over 745,000 personal-vehicle registrations across a sample of 1000 census block groups in the Philadelphia region, a trivariate Poisson-lognormal conditional autoregressive (CAR) model anticipates Prius hybrid EV, other EV, and conventional vehicle ownership levels. Initial results signal higher EV ownership rates in more central zones with higher household incomes, along with significant residual spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that spatially-correlated latent variables and/or peer (neighbor) effects on purchase decisions are present. Such data sets will become more comprehensive and informative as EV market shares rise. This workâs multivariate Poisson-lognormal CAR modeling approach offers a rigorous, behaviorally-defensible framework for spatial patterns in choice behavior.

Examples include ecosystems, physiological systems, and financial markets. Simplified versions of these system can be described by dynamical systems. As such, understanding the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems provides an important window into real-world phenomena. In this manuscript we focus on the qualitative behavior described by the measure concentrated on the attractor of a dynamical system. A common way to study such complicated measures is through their multifractal spectra. We will describe a new method, developed to approximate the Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle measure on an attractor, that is based on the Vietoris-Rips complex. We use it to approximate various measures concentrated on a number of example sets, and demonstrate its efficacy by computing the corresponding multifractal spectra.

There has been much debate about whether energy crops used to offset fossil fuel use, or carbon sequestration in forests, would provide the best climate mitigation benefit. Most current food cropland is unlikely to be used for bioenergy, but in many regions of the world, a proportion of cropland is being abandoned, particularly marginal croplands, and some of this land is now being used for bioenergy. In this study, we assess the consequences of land-use change on cropland. We first identify areas where cropland is so productive that it may never be converted and assess the potential of the remaining cropland to mitigate climate change by identifying which alternative land use provides the best climate benefit: C4 grass bioenergy crops, coppiced woody energy crops or allowing forest regrowth to create a carbon sink. We do not present this as a scenario of land-use change â we simply assess the best option in any given global location should a land-use change occur. To do this, we use global biomass potential studies based on food crop productivity, forest inventory data and dynamic global vegetation models to provide, for the first time, a global comparison of the climate change implications of either deploying bioenergy crops or allowing forest regeneration on current crop land, over a period of 20 years starting in the nominal year of 2000 ad. Globally, the extent of cropland on which conversion to energy crops or forest would result in a net carbon loss, and therefore likely always to remain as cropland, was estimated to be about 420.1 Mha, or 35.6% of the total cropland in Africa, 40.3% in Asia and Russia Federation, 30.8% in Europe-25, 48.4% in North America, 13.7% in South America and 58.5% in Oceania. Fast growing C4 grasses such as Miscanthus and switch-grass cultivars are the bioenergy feedstock with the highest climate mitigation potential. Fast growing C4 grasses such as Miscanthus and switch-grass cultivars provide the best climate mitigation option on â485 Mha of cropland worldwide with ~42% of this land characterized by a terrain slope equal or above 20%. If that land-use change did occur, it would displace â58.1 Pg fossil fuel C equivalent (Ceq oil). Woody energy crops such as poplar, willow and Eucalyptus species would be the best option on only 2.4% (â26.3 Mha) of current cropland, and if this land-use change occurred, it would displace â0.9 Pg Ceq oil. Allowing cropland to revert to forest would be the best climate mitigation option on â17% of current cropland (â184.5 Mha), and if this land-use change occurred, it would sequester â5.8 Pg C in biomass in the 20-year-old forest and â2.7 Pg C in soil. This study is spatially explicit, so also serves to identify the regional differences in the efficacy of different climate mitigation options, informing policymakers developing regionally or nationally appropriate mitigation actions.

One such foundation is Lorentz symmetry, which can be broken in the gravitational sector by the existence of a preferred time direction, and thus, a preferred frame at each spacetime point. This leads to a modification in the orbital decay rate of binary systems, and also in the generation and chirping of their associated gravitational waves. We here study whether waves emitted in the late, quasi-circular inspiral of non-spinning, neutron star binaries can place competitive constraints on two proxies of gravitational Lorentz-violation: Einstein-\AE{}ther theory and khronometric gravity. We model the waves in the small-coupling (or decoupling) limit and in the post-Newtonian approximation, by perturbatively solving the field equations in small deformations from General Relativity and in the small-velocity/weak-gravity approximation. We assume a gravitational wave consistent with General Relativity has been detected with second- and third-generation, ground-based detectors, and with the proposed space-based mission, DECIGO, with and without coincident electromagnetic counterparts. Without a counterpart, a detection consistent with General Relativity of neutron star binaries can only place competitive constraints on gravitational Lorentz violation when using future, third-generation or space-based instruments. On the other hand, a single counterpart is enough to place constraints that are 10 orders of magnitude more stringent than current binary pulsar bounds, even when using second-generation detectors. This is because Lorentz violation forces the group velocity of gravitational waves to be different from that of light, and this difference can be very accurately constrained with coincident observations.

Though substance-abuse treatment may be effective in reducing drug abuse, evidence for a causal effect of treatment on drug-related mortality is lacking. I analyze the effect of substance-abuse treatment on mortality by exploiting county-level variation in treatment facilities driven by facility openings and closings. The estimates indicate that a 10% increase in facilities lowers a county's drug-induced mortality rate by 2%. The estimated effects persist across individual and county characteristics and further indicate that spillovers of treatment reduce other related causes of death.

This is typically done by monitoring wavelength and intensity changes without necessarily knowing what causes such changes in detail. Simulations have been at the core of the considerable recent progress in improving the microscopic understanding of wavelength and quenching of fluorescence intensity in biopolymers. This review focuses on one of the most used intrinsic probes for protein behaviour, tryptophan (Trp), which is arguably now one of the best understood probes of internal structure and dynamics for proteins Ã¢â¬â despite its reputation to the contrary. In this review, we highlight selected classical molecular dynamics in combination with quantum mechanics simulations from our group and others during the past 20 years that support this view. The work includes simulations of time-dependent wavelength shifts in solvents and proteins, fluorescence-quenching rates, dielectric compensation by water, heterogeneity of quenching rates and applications to protein folding.

The method takes advantage of the attenuation of the Bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-ray radiation accompanying each X-ray spectrum, and the results are verified independently using AFM and the special pit geometry surrounding MnS inclusions in 1018 carbon steel. The method has general validity and is especially valuable in those cases where the pit depth-to-width ratio is too steep to measure using the conventional methods.

Mechanical ventilation leads to decreased comfort. Pain and anxiety may increase during this treatment modality, and the literature suggests this may directly affect patient comfort levels. Music therapy as a nursing intervention within the context of comfort, pain, and anxiety of mechanically ventilated patients was investigated. This quasi-experiemental study used a pre-test and post-test design with subjects serving as their own control. The convenience sample consisted of 2 men and 3 women who were mechanically ventilated and fit the selection criteria. Dependent variables measured included comfort, pain, and anxiety. Physiologic dependent measures included heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure collected at timed intervals. Comfort was measured using a modified version of the Hospice Comfort Questionnaire. Pain was measured using the Numerical Graphic Rating Pain Scale. Anxiety was measured using the Faces Anxiety Scale. Important preliminary quantitative results are provided by this pilot study. The mean, standard deviation, significance, and paired t-tests were compared for each tool to determine changes in scoring before and after the intervention and control. This was also completed for physiological data including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate. Paired t-tests showed no significant mean differences between two points of measurement on systolic, diastolic, heart rate, and respiratory rate in both the intervention and control groups. Comfort, anxiety, and pain scores before and after the intervention and control also did not demonstrate significance. The small sample size makes generalization of these findings impossible to the entire population of acute mechanically ventilated patients in Billings, Montana.

However, there are very few studies that have been designed to investigate that relationship with online learners. Individuals with a strong internal locus of control are said to use resources in unique ways, are persistent, and generally reach the goals that they set for themselves. However, it is not known what specific tactics these individuals utilize in order to succeed. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first was to explore the relationship between internal locus of control as measured by Rotter's Locus of Control Inventory and academic performance measured by course grade among online learners, the second was to investigate the unique learning tactics of successful online learners. Students enrolled in fall semester 2004 online courses at Montana State University Great Falls College of Technology were asked to participate in an online study of their learning tactics. Though there was no statistically significant difference between the sample (n = 122) and the population (N = 595) with regard to age, gender, and grade distribution in this study, a preponderance of high grades and strong internal locus of control scores within the sample resulted in a nonstatistically significant relationship between locus of control and academic performance. The sample was predominately successful in online courses and reflected an internal locus of control. Ten of the students in the sample were interviewed to explore the learning tactics that they used to navigate within the online learning environment. Three themes or learning tactics emerged from the oneonone interviews. The first tactic focused on the amount of time required in online courses, the second focused on the necessary commitment of the student to attend to the online course, and the third tactic related to the resistance of the students to engage in group work and projects within their online courses. It is recommended that these tactics be further investigated as related to student success in online delivered courses.	['persons', 'students', 'college students']

Prior geochemical and metagenome characterization has identified the primary electron donors and acceptors and phylotypes distributed across a range in pH and geochemical conditions. Although several chemolithoautotrophs are expected to play a direct role in the fixation of inorganic C in these communities, little work has directly identified the importance of this process in situ. Consequently, the primary goal of this thesis was to evaluate the role of CO 2 fixation across numerous types of geothermal habitats and to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions that may control community composition. Genes encoding enzymes for inorganic C fixation pathways were identified in assembled genome sequence corresponding to the predominant autotrophs (Crenarchaeota and Aquificales) observed in Fe(III)-oxide mats, sulfur sediments, and filamentous streamer communities. Carbon isotope (13 C) mixing models were used to interpret the 13C compositional values of microbial samples as a function of 13C-dissolved inorganic C (DIC) and 13 C-organic C (DOC and/or landscape sources). The relative abundance of autotrophs versus heterotrophs identified in complementary metagenome analysis and respective CO 2-fixation fractionation factors were utilized in site-specific mixing models to calculate minimum contributions of DIC-derived microbial C across 15 different microbial communities. Genome sequence was also used to develop stoichiometric reaction networks for a primary autotroph (Metallosphaera yellowstonensis) and heterotroph ('Geoarchaeota') important in acidic Fe(III)-oxide mats. Possible modes of biomass production were evaluated for different C sources and/or electron donors as a function of oxygen cost. The total oxygen flux was also used to predict the rate of Fe(II)-oxidation, and these values were compared to Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates and oxygen fluxes measured in situ. Stoichiometric modeling and elementary flux mode analysis established an optimum autotroph to heterotroph ratio (2.4:1) for DIC-derived biomass dependent on Fe(II) as the electron donor. Comparison of predicted Fe(II)-oxidation rates with observed Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates and oxygen flux measurements using microelectrodes suggest the importance of other oxygen consuming processes. Results from this thesis demonstrated the importance of inorganic C fixation in numerous geochemically distinct high-temperature microbial habitats, and the potential for DIC-derived biomass to support other hyperthermophilic heterotrophic organisms.

At the crossroads of databases and machine learning, modern data indexing enables information retrieval capabilities that would otherwise be impractical or near impossible to attain and apply. One such useful retrieval task in our increasingly data-driven world is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search, which returns the k most similar items in a dataset to the search query provided. While the k-NN concept was popularized in every-day use through the sorted (ranked) results of online text-based search engines like Google, multimedia applications are rapidly becoming the new frontier of research. This dissertation advances the current state of high-dimensional data indexing with the creation of a novel index named ID* (\ID Star""). Based on extensive theoretical and empirical analyses, we discuss important challenges associated with high dimensional data and identify several shortcomings of existing indexing approaches and methodologies. By further mitigating against the negative effects of the curse of dimensionality, we are able to push the boundary of effective k-NN retrieval to a higher number of dimensions over much larger volumes of data. As the foundations of the ID* index, we developed an open-source and extensible distance-based indexing framework predicated on the basic concepts of the popular iDistance index, which utilizes an internal B+-tree for efficient one-dimensional data indexing. Through the addition of several new heuristic-guided algorithmic improvements and hybrid indexing extensions, we show that our new ID* index can perform significantly better than several other popular alternative indexing techniques over a wide variety of synthetic and real-world data. In addition, we present applications of our ID* index through the use of k-NN queries in Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems and machine learning classification. An emphasis is placed on the NASA sponsored interdisciplinary research goal of developing a CBIR system for large-scale solar image repositories. Since such applications rely on fast and effective k-NN queries over increasingly large-scale and high-dimensional datasets, it is imperative to utilize an efficient data indexing strategy such as the ID* index."

CV-STSM integrates outputs from four different modeling systems. Successional changes in tree species composition and stand structure were represented as transition probabilities and organized into a state-and-transition simulation model. States were characterized based on assessments of both current vegetation and of projected future vegetation from a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). State definitions included sufficient detail to support the integration of CV-STSM with an agent-based model of land-use decisions and a mechanistic model of fire behavior and spread. Transition probabilities were parameterized using output from a stand biometric model run across a wide range of site productivities. Biogeographic and biogeochemical projections from the DGVM were used to adjust the transition probabilities to account for the impacts of climate change on site productivity and potential vegetation type. We conducted experimental simulations in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. Our simulation landscape incorporated detailed new assessments of critically imperiled Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) savanna and prairie habitats among the suite of existing and future vegetation types. The experimental design fully crossed four future climate scenarios with three disturbance scenarios. CV-STSM showed strong interactions between climate and disturbance scenarios. All disturbance scenarios increased the abundance of oak savanna habitat, but an interaction between the most intense disturbance and climate-change scenarios also increased the abundance of subtropical tree species. Even so, subtropical tree species were far less abundant at the end of simulations in CV-STSM than in the dynamic global vegetation model simulations. Our results indicate that dynamic global vegetation models may overestimate future rates of vegetation change, especially in the absence of stand-replacing disturbances. Modeling tools such as CV-STSM that simulate rates and direction of vegetation change affected by interactions and feedbacks between climate and land-use change can help policy makers, land managers, and society as a whole develop effective plans to adapt to rapidly changing climate.

Full-scale glulam beams (79 mm by 229 mm deep) at two moisture contents (12 and 28%) and three temperatures (20 ÃÂ°C, 0 ÃÂ°C, and Ã¢Ëâ 40 ÃÂ°C) were tested in four-point bending until failure. Temperature was observed to affect the failure mechanism of the beams, with the beams tested at 0 ÃÂ°C and 20 ÃÂ°C failing in shear and the beams tested at Ã¢Ëâ 40 ÃÂ°C failing in tension. Further, the strengths of the beams and their stiffnesses were observed to increase with decreasing temperature, with these effects being more pronounced in the higher moisture content beams. Over the temperature range of 20 ÃÂ°C to Ã¢Ëâ 40 ÃÂ°C, the 12 percent moisture content beams observed strength and stiffness gains of 17 and 22%, while the 28 percent moisture content beams observed respective gains of 37% and 66%.

The 5E Learning Cycle was the inquiry model that was used. Students' level of engagement was monitored using journaling and classroom observations. To track changes of students' understanding of content material a pre and post-test was administered over the course of two units. The results of the study found that the 5E Learning Cycle had a positive impact on both engagement and understanding of content.

Students participated in seven outdoor experiences total, including two full-day field days and five outdoor class sessions. Students were interviewed and surveyed so that data could be collected before and after the outdoor experiences. In addition, students' behavior and attitudes were observed during the outdoor experiences. The students were also asked to recall information about the two field days to examine their retention of relevant information. Additional data was collected on the use of electronics by students, and how it impacted their time outdoors. Results revealed that students' attitudes about outdoor learning were better than their attitudes toward learning in the classroom. The majority of students rated their behavior as good to great during each outdoor class session. Students often reflected that they were more on task in an outdoor setting than in an indoor learning environment. Students agreed that electronics sometimes kept them from being outdoors. Increased credit was given to teachers or schools and to students educating themselves in regard to who taught them the most about nature and the outdoors. Overall, the data indicated outdoor experiences had a positive impact on students' time on task, attitudes, and motivation toward learning science.

It also assesses sixth grade students' accuracy in determining their final test scores on both traditional written unit final tests and final performance tasks. Eighty-four sixth graders in four different classes were studied across four different science units. Two classes formed Sample A and two classes formed Sample B. They alternated taking traditional written end of unit tests and taking performance tasks instead. They recorded their predicted scores and their feelings about each test on a survey immediately after testing. The study's results are inconclusive. While the teachers felt less confident preparing students for the performance tasks, students appeared to prefer them, and did moderately better on them. How much better was not found to be statistically significant, though. Students in Sample B consistently outperformed Sample A on all assessments, but Sample A students reported having studied for final tests more often. In all, this study shows how middle school students can be unpredictable and are not always self aware, but do prefer to be engaged in hands-on learning. There may be something to be said for student enjoyment of an assessment, even if the final scores students earn on non traditional tests are only moderately better.

This action research project focused on using language frames to guide students in communication interactions. The research was done in a pre-engineering classroom as part of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Program at the middle school level. Two classes of students, a total of 57 students, participated in the study. Students were provided with sentence frames that could be filled in with their own words allowing them to express their ideas and reasoning. Some of the language frames also provided students with the ability to show they are listening to other students by restating what was heard. Written surveys and collaboration rubrics were analyzed to find a small increase in communication among collaborative groups. Students' self ratings on their listening and communication skills increased as well as the opinions towards working in groups. Video observations showed a more dramatic increase in students' time spent communicating from before the treatment time. Although there is not strong data to directly support the use of language frames, students communicated with each other more and the overall classroom environment improved from the teacher point of view. Completing the action research project also provided a more in depth practice of collecting and analyzing data as a teacher.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']
70311	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9242	The effects of teaching perseverance on student independence in mathematical problem solving	Perseverance is an attribute often required for student success but is seldom taught. This research investigated the effects of teaching and practicing perseverance to a combined class of second and third grade students. Data collected from surveys, teacher observations, journal entries and class discussions were analyzed to see if students' ability to work independently and appreciation of their individual ability to persevere could be increased through participation in lessons requiring them to work through difficult academic challenges. Student time-on-task, comments and questions were recorded during these lessons and other classroom assessments. Student journal sheets were also completed for each lesson, and a teacher journal was kept for the entirety of the investigation. This class proved to work independently as a whole; however, results did not show any improvement in student time-on-task over the treatment period, suggesting that student ability to persevere was not significantly affected. Survey results, journal entries, and class discussions showed an increase in students' understanding and appreciation of their ability to persevere. As a result of this treatment, students also appeared to become more comfortable and confident when presented with difficult academic challenges. It is the conclusion of this study that while directly teaching and practicing perseverance may not improve students' ability to work independently through challenging tasks, it can be a valuable tool in heightening students' understanding of their abilities and boosting confidence. Therefore, based on my research, teaching and practicing perseverance should be continued as a regular classroom activity.

The areas being looked at were content knowledge learned, content knowledge retained, student motivation and teacher motivation. Preassessments, assessments and postassessments as well as student interviews and student surveys were all used to determine if students performed better or were more motivated when working with collaborative groups. The data was analyzed as a whole group cluster and was also broken down into three performance clusters representing the low, medium and high performing students. Keeping a journal throughout the research process and asking a colleague to observe my attitude and interactions with the students measured teacher motivation. In contrast to what I thought the data would represent, all groups showed greater gains in content learned when working individually. However, when content knowledge retained was analyzed, students retained the knowledge learned better when they worked in collaborative groups. Students were also more motivated and expressed that they preferred to work in collaborative groups more then working individually. As a teacher, I also enjoyed my teaching more and interacted with the students more when the students were working in collaborative groups.

Scientific argumentation was introduced in a seventh-grade life science classroom in Idaho on the topic of wolf management. Students were responsible for conducting research about the topic and learning about both sides and then participating in a large group argument and a small group argument about wolf management in Idaho. The study found that student opinions changed to more pro-wolf or became more neutral as a result of the argumentation and that student learning of the topic also increased.

There is no doubt students like the idea of having their own personal laptop; but how can a laptop change the way students learn? Being 1-to-1 does not mean the previously mentioned methods of student learning behaviors are no longer part of a classroom routine; however, with the addition of computers into the classroom, each teacher needs to ask themselves: What instructional changes can be made to best utilize student laptop use and how can students be motivated to use the laptop as a tool to meet the course requirements? The purpose of this paper is to highlight multiple ways of incorporating laptops into a physical science classroom. In the final analysis, twenty-three students used their laptops to study and learn individually as well as in a group setting. The majority of these students found laptops to be an effective tool in the learning process.

The study was conducted in an Alternative Education High School in Albany, Oregon. The specific classes this unit was taught in were Biology and Astronomy. Each class was given a different set of standards to follow, models were continually drawn to aid in the understanding of a star's life cycle as well as the cell cycle. Students who participated in this study were given a Likert-scale survey as well as pre and post tests to monitor knowledge. The Likert-scale questions probed student motivation, science interest, and the use of models and rubrics. The pre and post tests for each class were centered on standards focused on for the term. The findings of this study were that the use of science models and rubrics increased student motivation and learning. Analysis of surveys and tests showed the use of visuals is important when students learned new concepts, especially those that tend to deal with cycles and the need to understand multiple steps or parts of a standard.

70323	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9257	The effects of scientific argumentation on student attitudes and evidence based reasoning skills	For a scientifically literate society, there must be trust in the scientific community. This is only possible with an appreciation for the value of consensus, and the rigors that scientific consensus inherently requires. Students need more practice with construction and identification of valid explanations, in addition to more experience comparing and communicating multiple claims for the same question. Argumentation by evidence provides these opportunities and is the seventh practice of the Next Generation of Science Standards. This action research based project measured the effect student participation in a treatment consisting of five scientific argumentation activities on students' evidence-based reasoning skills, comfort levels and general attitudes towards science. Results showed slight improvement of evidence-based reasoning skills, a more complete understanding of scientific argumentation as a practice, and higher confidence and comfort levels when doing science. Results also indicated a slight improvement in students' abilities to identify valid evidence and reliable sources of information. This study also measured the types of evidence and quality of claims and justification provided by students during the treatment activities. Patterns seen in these measurements included common use of definitions as claims, inability to construct a concise yet sufficient claim, difficulty distinguishing claims from evidence, and a prevalent student viewpoint that providing justification for evidence is of less importance than providing evidence for claims.

70324	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9258	The effect of a scientific reading curriculum on overall performance and attitude in High school students.	There is a growing influence of technology on scientific learning, with primary focus on learning in an online environment. This has both benefits and challenges, but in the science classroom, a primary challenge is being able to read the required material effectively on your own, and then productively present that material in class discussions and on assessments. While this is a well-developed skill in the humanities, it is not a primary focus of instruction in a typical high school science classroom of approximately 15 students. The primary question I sought to answer with this study was what the effects of implementing and testing some reading comprehension strategies on high school students would have on their ability to retain information on tests, their performance on daily quizzes, and their confidence level in the classroom. Four academic units in a high school Biochemistry course were studied, and progressed in the order of the Digestive System, Vitamins and Minerals, Exercise Physiology, and Immunology. Understanding of concepts was assessed using student-developed concept maps, and overall interest and participation was assessed by anonymous surveys, and one-one-one student-instructor interviews. While overall test and quiz scores increased only very slightly throughout the intervention, class participation increased and student interviews reflected a positive increase in confidence and quality of thought in the science classroom.

I wanted to see if I could teach the same math and science standards that students would learn in a traditional school setting in the context of outdoor education. This study tested the effects on student learning and students themselves through their participation in an experiential all-outdoor classroom. Outdoor education is a teaching method, not a subject. I took students on four day long trips to learn math and science standards through experiential learning in the outdoors. The triangulation method was used to answer my purpose of study question. Pre and post test were used to determine how each student learned. Pre and post interviews and surveys were used to gather students' thoughts about their participation in the outdoor classroom. The results showed that students experienced high levels of learning through participation in an all-outdoor classroom. Additionally, the outdoor classroom was a positive learning experience, and all students interviewed expressed interest in attending in the future.

70326	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9260	The impact of inquiry learning on students' ability to analyze data and draw conclusions	Previous research suggests that involving students in real world inquiry projects improves their understanding of science content. Some particular features that inquiry teachers use include being a facilitator, modeling inquiry, encouraging student thinking, and engaging students in self-directed learning in which students solve problems, hypothesize, interpret data, create experiments, and explain findings. The primary focus of this study was to determine the impact of inquiry learning on sixth grade students' ability to analyze science data and draw conclusions. The 5E's inquiry teaching model was used during the research. The 5E's include engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate. They are a series of steps when lesson planning that involves creating excitement, asking questions and designing ways to answer questions, sharing information and then taking investigations a step further or to the next level. Activities that were appropriate for Earth Science were selected. Each successive inquiry activity utilized a gradual release of inquiry components. The outcomes of a five week inquiry unit were compared to the results of a five week traditional teaching unit. The results of this study suggested both traditional and inquiry teaching are important to develop well-rounded science students. Inquiry teaching improves students' ability to apply science skills to data and analysis and drawing conclusions tasks. This produces strong science thinkers. Traditional teaching improves students' ability to demonstrate data analysis and drawing conclusions skills on traditional tests. Because students need all of these skills, both teaching methods should continue to be an integral part of teaching.

The research focused on one of the worksheets about habitats created for second through fourth grade students. Teachers from those grades who were scheduled to visit the Aquarium in the month of March were solicited to participate in the study. Two teachers agreed to participant in different capacities. Based on the lack of student enthusiasm and my evaluation of completed the activity sheets and student surveys, I determined that the activity sheet was not effective at fostering learning or interest. However, the activity sheets were effective when used by chaperones instead of individual students. Additional research should be conducted to specifically evaluate using chaperones to led activities during self-guided tours of the Tennessee Aquarium.

They tend to show characteristics of novice problem solvers, such as fixating on finding an answer or neglecting to understand the principles behind the problem. Most of the in-class problem solving exercises are traditionally teacher-led. Students are expected to pay attention in class and work on developing their own skills as they work on homework. To address these difficulties, the treatment section engaged in group problem solving sessions in lieu of the teacher-led sessions. They were given a protocol to follow to work together at developing skills of expert problem solvers. During the treatment period, students in the treatment section showed small improvements on problem solving assessments when compared to their comparison counterparts. While there were small gains made, it might be best to employ multiple in-class problem solving methods throughout the year to foster the greatest development in problem solving skills for first-year physics students.

This study analyzed the use of argumentation activities and the impact on students' abilities to explain scientific phenomena. Students engaged in argument through consensus building jigsaws and assigned audience roles that focused on specific aspects of explanations. The results indicate that students were more focused on making observations to enable them to make claims based on evidence after engaging in scientific argument.

"A student's ability to face academic adversity is identified as resilience. It is described as being able to ""bounce back"" in the face of challenges. The question posed by this project is how does an inquiry-based design lab course impact the resilience learning of middle school students? The 55 middle school students at the Perkiomen School, in Pennsburg, PA, participated in such a course, where they were asked to use creativity to solve challenging problems in the classroom. The students completed pre- and post-treatment 8-Question Grit Scale surveys. They also described their experiences in the course using reflective assignments. They also participated in group interviews, and selected students participated in individual interviews. The pre-treatment student grit scores ranged between 1.88 and 4.50 with a mean of 3.44, while the post-treatment survey showed a range of 1.75 to 4.50 with a mean of 3.38. The teacher-completed surveys regarding how they perceived each student's grit showed a similar range, 1.92 to 4.56 with a mean of 3.25. The overall success of the treatment during the study was inconclusive. The overall student grit score dropped by a score of 0.06. The day student subgroup showed a decrease in grit score over the study of 0.03, though the boarding student subgroup also showed a decrease of 0.13. The findings of this study are encouraging, while though the mean grit score of all participants remained relatively unchanged, a majority of students did not show a negative change (33 of 54, 61%). While the idea of iteration and failure was always present in each activity, the students appeared to focus more on group dynamics when evaluating their progress. This leads to several interesting questions when planning future iterations of this course. Would the students benefit from a larger workspace which would allow for small workgroups and more independence? Would the course benefit from more time in the weekly class schedule, offering the students more opportunity to test their strategies? Lastly, given the relatively short time frame of the treatment period, would longer term surveying of the students validate the long term benefits of such a course?"

This study examined alternative approaches to presenting lab findings through a more real world applicable approach. The purpose of this study was to test alternatives and analyze student feedback on the effectiveness of the newly designed lab report format. Forty-four freshman Biology students were divided into two groups: traditional lab reporting and alternative lab reporting. The two groups submitted different lab reports based on their grouping over from the end of January to the beginning of April 2015. Results were analyzed through student interviews, feedback surveys, lab report grades, and lab specific questions on unit exams. Although statistical analysis of the project data showed no significant difference between the traditional and alternative lab report methods, this project suggested value in challenging the way teachers approach formal lab report assignments.

Traditional science teaching often asks students to be passive participants in their own learning. By learning through project-based learning students had the opportunity to construct their own learning of Newtonian physics by exploring the driving question, how can we, as museum designers, plan an exhibit that demonstrates Newton's Laws in urban design? To accomplish this task students, over a three-month period, explored the concepts related to each of the laws of motion and for each law created a working exhibit that connected the law to an urban design feature found in New York City. Students participated in labs, read books on urban design and engineering, visited museums, prototyped their exhibits and learned from experts in the field on urban engineering and museum design. Through the analysis of data collected, I was able to determine that students felt connected to their city and saw the applicability of physics in the real world. Students effectively collaborated throughout the unit, their SRL improved over the course of study, and the teacher was of more of a guide in the learning process than a lecturer.

The main goal of this study was to determine if learning about STEM careers would increase the number of students considering a career in a STEM field, and if that would change their engagement in the classroom and their choice of classes while still in high school. The treatment included four days of classroom instruction, web explorations, and discussions with STEM professionals. The results show that students were more interested in pursuing STEM careers, class participation improved, and students changed their courses for next year to include more STEM classes.

As students continue to have access to video games and other high tech gadgets, which provide immediate gratifications, teaching by direct instruction doesn't always hold an individual's attention. The purpose of this study was to see if using Smart Board presentations and clickers increased student engagement and performance. Students were introduced to clickers last year, so they were familiar with how to use them at the beginning of the study. Students' surveys, class work, homework, assessments, teacher observation, clicker quizzes and interviews were all used to evaluate the effectiveness of their use in the classroom. The findings did not show a statistically increase on every quiz, however, there was a noticeable increase in the area of math. Overall student opinions were highly supportive of clicker use in the classroom and many stated they were fun to use.

In addition, students are increasingly taking courses online. Therefore, an action research-based project was undertaken in a high school anatomy and physiology course to identify the impact of case studies and online discussions on content acquisition, student interest and engagement. Two treatment methods were employed across three separate sections of grade twelve anatomy and physiology classes. One treatment included the implementation of case studies entirely in class, while the second treatment duplicated the first treatment but included additional case analysis via online discussions outside of class time. The results suggest that students can acquire new content through the use of case studies and that students generally enjoy and find case studies to be an interesting learning method. In addition, while overall student perceptions of using online discussions were negative, overall student test scores across all three case studies were higher, on average, in the treatment group that included online discussions.

In addition, there are many negative perceptions about chemistry that have been passed down from other teachers, parents and peers. As an Expeditionary Learning school students are presented with practical applications in order to master content targets in all subjects. In this study I investigated the use of practical applications in the chemistry classroom to determine if it had an impact on student content mastery/retention, student motivation and teacher motivation. In the treatment students âadoptedâ an element that is found in water and researched how the element impacts human health, as well as the basic structure, isotopes and Lewis structure of the element. The students also found the amount of their element in DC water (to try to incorporate a personal connection). Students were required to create an infographic (a graphic containing information) that incorporated all of this information. Finally, students presented their work to a group of experts (scientists, water experts and former chemistry students). Throughout the treatment, class time was split into mini-lessons and work time. Data collection consisted of pre, post and retention tests, analysis of learning target scores, teacher journaling, observations, student surveys and student interviews. All students completed the surveys, pre, post and retention tests and a select group of students were interviewed. My instructional coach and co-teacher completed observations prior to the treatment and during the treatment. The results from the study indicate that student content mastery and retention does increase with the use of practical applications. It also showed that teacher motivation increased; however, student motivation did not appear to increase with the use of practical applications. Based on these outcomes I plan to continue to use practical applications in my classroom, but in the future I would like to try to emphasize personal connections between students and the content to ensure that student motivation also increases.

As a special education teacher specializing in the sciences, the engagement level and academic success of students with learning differences was a concern for me. The general disconnect of students from nature and the practical, real-life applications of scientific knowledge was also a concern. I introduced elements of outdoor education to my special science classes over the last five years and the impact of these experiences on my students was dramatically positive. This research project was designed to determine the impact of outdoor education on students' assessment results and engagement level. It was important to prove that the time investment of outdoor education would have a negligible or positive impact on high stakes, high school exit exams. Students were exposed to Environment as Integrating Concept methodology from December to April of the school year. Students had one to two outdoor education experiences each month in local environments and related to local environmental issues. They were exposed to one treatment/outdoor education unit and the results of this unit was correlated with the results of one similar, non-treatment/traditional unit and a unit that incorporated both teaching methods. Longitudinal data was also collected. The results of the study indicated dramatically improved engagement and motivation levels among the students, and limited improvement in content understanding. Students without executive functioning disabilities benefitted more from the outdoor experiences.

A crucial component to improving this situation is access to information on the decision environment and behavior of smallholders in these countries. One challenge facing agricultural households is the lack of effective access for input and output markets. The markets that do exist often fail to facilitate efficient trade between buyers and sellers. Smallholders are forced to adjust their production behavior to compensate for this lack of market access. The purpose of this paper is to examine the crop diversification and technology adoption decisions made by households, in relation to their distance and, by implication, lack of access to a market center. This thesis uses a dataset that contains information on the production systems of Ethiopian smallholders in 2000/2001. The focus of the analysis is on the determinants of chemical fertilizer adoption, crop diversification levels, and crop choices. A simultaneous equation model is used to obtain estimates for the decisions to adopt chemical fertilizer and diversify crop mix in which the endogenous variables are truncated. In addition, a system of five OLS equations is used to explain the shares of land devoted to major categories of crops (primary staple crops; cereals/pulses; oils/spices; fruits/vegetables; and cash crops). The empirical results indicate that Ethiopian smallholders do react to changes in the level of market access by altering their production behavior.

This difference may largely be due to the way physics classes are traditionally taught. Peer Instruction has been developed to help bridge the gap between conceptual understanding and problem solving ability. This study introduced Peer Instruction to two classes of senior high school physics and monitored over the course of one unit. During instruction, conceptual multiple choice questions were presented and student responses were polled. For questions below a threshold percentage of correct responses, students were given the opportunity to discuss the question before it was re-polled. The use of Peer Instruction showed significant improvement in the conceptual performance of students, without affecting their problem-solving ability. The class room dynamics changed in such a way that student engagement was also improved.	['high school students', 'physics', 'students', 'physical sciences', 'science', 'persons']

The data also support the effect of ADI on student understanding of high school biology concepts because all students did successfully construct an argument, discuss the argument with evidence, and improve their speaking and listening skills which is part of the ten habits that demonstrate effective use of scientific argumentation (Corwin, 2013). The data indicate ADI lessons have a positive effect on student engagement. Based on the Biology Motivation Questionnaire, prior to ADI lessons 43% of students reported âlearning biology is interestingâ and after ADI lessons this number increased to 60%. Students also showed a greater enjoyment of learning biology after ADI session with 50 % of students reporting this to be true often or always in comparison to only 33% before ADI lessons. Also students reported an increase from 33% to 50% that âthe biology I learn is relevantâ pre-post ADI intervention. This supports the idea that if students are engaged in inquiry based projects that are relevant to authentic science experiences and share their work among peers, it increases their enjoyment of science (Chung & Behan, 2010)	['life sciences', 'high school students', 'biology', 'students', 'science', 'persons']

I was interested to see if the flipped classroom would impact my students understanding of the concepts required by the College Board. Additionally, I wanted to see the effects of the flipped classroom on students' higher-order thinking skills and their ability to complete inquiry-based labs. Finally, I wanted to determine the effects of the flipped classroom on my role as an AP Biology teacher. I chose to move my lectures outside of the classroom and had students watch my pre-recorded lectures accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation for a homework assignment. Two separate Biology units were observed, one included the flipped classroom model and the other was taught using routine teaching strategies and traditional lecture format. Students were also required to participate in an online discussion of the video lectures and were assessed on their understanding of the video content the following class period by a quiz. Students were surveyed prior to the treatment and following the treatment regarding their understanding of the flipped classroom as well as the concepts to be covered during the intervention. A select group of students were interviewed pre and post treatment to glean their ideas about the flipped classroom and its effects. The majority of student feedback thought the flipped classroom was effective in learning the concepts, increasing student teacher interactions, increasing their higher order thinking skills and helping them complete an inquiry based lab. Data from assessments did not support an increase in understanding in the flipped classroom as opposed to a traditional classroom, however the gap between the two classes of AP Biology students was narrowed by the use of the flipped classroom. Overall the flipped classroom did not appear to have a significant impact on student learning, however, for many students the increase in understanding was encouraging and their reaction positive.

The Nature of Science (NOS) needs to be taught explicitly but teachers often do not do so because it is an area often misunderstood and poorly presented in textbooks and curricula. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of teaching the NOS through the use of a series of brief lessons on topics from history and pseudoscience. Twelve intervention lessons were presented in a variety of formats over a nine week period to students in three high school chemistry classes. A total of 56 students of a range of academic abilities participated in the study. Data collection instruments were developed to measure understanding of eight defined aspects of the NOS as well as student engagement and attitudes toward studying chemistry. Students were also interviewed and observed during the lessons. At the conclusion of the research students demonstrated an increased and more robust understanding of all aspects of the NOS. Data also showed that the lessons in history and pseudoscience were effective for student engagement. The lessons were regarded as interesting and fun and helped provide context for curricular material.

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to determine if there was a measurable change in student mastery of content and in students' attitudes towards science instruction outdoors. Additionally, the study aimed to discover if students' use of mobile devices facilitated self-guided learning. The intervention took place over an eight-week period in the winter of 2015, involving 33 seventh grade science students at New Canaan Country School, an independent suburban day school in New Canaan, CT. During the intervention, students completed a unit in the field on forest ecosystem structure and function. One group used mobile devices for tasks in the field while the other group worked without devices. During the second field unit on winter adaptations, the intervention switched so that by the end of both units of instruction, each group had used mobile devices. Assessments were administered during and after each unit; students also completed attitude surveys and questionnaires, and they participated in interviews.

First, the use of In(OTf)3 as a catalyst in the acylation of a number of carbohydrates was explored. The utility and compatibility of the In(OTf)3 reaction conditions with a number of protecting groups on the sugars were examined by 1H NMR analysis. In the second part of the carbohydrate methodology, the feasibility of using In(OTf)3 to promote glycosylation reactions using a number of glycosyl donors was evaluated. These studies were conducted using 1H NMR, 13CNMR, and Micro-ToF mass spectrometry. In both cases, In(OTf)3 was found to be a viable if highly acidic Lewis acid for these reactions. Silicon tether methodology was explored with the goal of obtaining 1,3 and 1,2-amino alcohols. The parameters for this reaction were explored after precursors and 1,3-amino alcohols were synthesized. These studies were conducted using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy, and Micro-ToF mass spectrometry. While some success was achieved, this route is unlikely to be widely adopted due to the multi-step syntheses that are required to obtain viable reaction precursors.

New York State requires a high stakes exit exam that all students must pass in order to receive their academic diploma. The assessment is content and reading-comprehensive, and it requires that students use a 16-page reference table to interpret graphs and charts for about 40% of the questions. Many teachers find it difficult to treat all sections of the curriculum with the time that it deserves unless they are simply teaching to the test. Some of the content is too abstract for many ninth grade students, thus considerable time should be spent on practice in class. Practicing with students in class burns time that teachers would normally use to deliver information. The Flipped Classroom Instructional Model was designed to deliver the traditional classroom lecture through a video screencast as a homework assignment. Students are told to watch videos at home, take good notes, write down any question that they have, and come to class the following day prepared to have their questions answered and to practice the concepts. Could this model work for a ninth grade Physical Setting Earth Science class in rural, western New York? Data collection for this project included two weeks of traditional classroom teaching methods for the non-treatment unit, delivering content about relative age in geologic time. It also included two weeks of implementing the Flipped Classroom Instructional Model for the treatment unit, delivering content about absolute age dating methods in geologic time. Instruments used included pre-and post unit content assessments, classroom assessment techniques, surveys, interviews, and journals. Results revealed that flipping the classroom was most beneficial to students with Individualized Education Plans, below-average achieving males, and average-achieving females. Above-average students showed marginal benefits. Below-average achieving females and average-achieving males did not appear to benefit from the treatment.

The definition of inquiry is quite varied, and its implementation is hindered by a number of well-documented factors. The literature describes scaffolded inquiry instruction as a successful method for incorporating inquiry in the classroom. In this action research project, one model of an inquiry scaffold called QPOE2 was introduced to a fourth-grade classroom. Through unit assessments, concept mapping, student interviews, student surveys, and teacher observations, data was compiled to measure its effectiveness on student scientific understandings, engagement in scientific argumentation, and motivation for science in the classroom. While unit assessments indicate student scientific understandings did not improve as significantly following treatment with this model of inquiry, concept-mapping data indicate that students did make similar gains in scientific understanding following instruction with the QPOE2 model. Data indicates that following instruction with the QPOE2 model, students' understanding and ability to engage in scientific argumentation and student motivation improved. Implications of this project highlight the powerful motivational effects experienced by students when engaging in science through a scaffolded inquiry approach.

This study investigated the effects of iPads on second grade students' understanding of math concepts and the students' attitudes toward using iPads in math class. For five units, one second grade class alternated by unit between iPad and non-iPad activities to practice math skills. During the final unit of the study each student chose whether or not to use the iPad. To understand the iPad's effect on student learning, the following data was gathered: scores of unit pretests and posttests, student confidence surveys, tracking of on task/off task behavior, teacher field notes, and student interviews. To understand students' attitudes toward iPads, the following data was gathered: pre- and post-treatment attitude surveys, teacher field notes, and student interviews. Results from the study indicated that iPads did not have a greater effect on posttest scores than more traditional methods of practicing math skills. Results also indicate that iPads do not have a stronger effect on students' confidence levels in math. However the data indicated that students were more engaged in math activities when using iPads than when not using iPads. Additionally, when given the choice between using the iPad and non-iPad activities, students more frequently chose the iPad to practice math skills. Students reported positive attitudes toward using the iPad in math class at the conclusion of the study.

This project looked at the effectiveness of learning human anatomy online versus hands-on learning and learning through simulations versus lecture and reading. This study considered different modes of instruction through the perceptions of medical professionals at University of California San Francisco and Sheridan High School human anatomy students. Medical professionals suggested best teaching practices for high school human anatomy and physiology teachers. The high school students shared their learning strategies that could lead to a successful high school course. Through interviews and surveys a group composed of high school students, medical students, surgical residents, fellows and surgeons shared their opinions on the effectiveness of different learning and teaching styles of human anatomy and physiology concepts. Data collection for this project not only included online survey questions, but also personal interviews. The results suggested that anatomy and physiology courses taught to pre-college level students should include a large portion of hands-on learning and teaching styles.

Sixty-four students of various ages and in various courses from ninth- to twelfth-grade took part in the Reflection and Revision Cycle exercises throughout the winter term. Data was collected via series of surveys, interviews, focus groups, and anonymous questionnaires during the intervention/treatment period that all asked students to think about their own engagement in the course, and how they perceived the assessment structure of the course. The collected data failed to directly support the idea that student engagement and positive perceptions of course assessment would both increase over the course of the treatment. However, the more open-ended data instruments such as interviews and focus groups provided much evidence that the inclusion of Reflection and Revision Cycles specifically, and self-assessment and alternative assessment practices in general, can be important drivers of student engagement and perceptions, and that they will be important additions to my classes going forward."

Traditionally they have been done with a pencil and paper. As technology and students move into the future, computers and web based learning are rapidly replacing the pencil and paper. This research was designed to measure student's attitude toward web based learning, how using a web-based notebook increases metaknowledge (how one learns) and does it increase problem solving skills. During the treatment, students made and used a web based notebook in OneNote. In it they could complete assignments and solve problems in their preferred learning style. After the treatment, data showed that today's students have a favorable attitude toward web based learning. However, only 60% of students completed work in their preferred learning style (N =15). Data also showed that problem solving skills remained the same or slightly decreased as a result of using a web based notebook.	['persons', 'high school students', 'students']

Twenty-two student in on section of middle school science were the focus of study on the effects of using Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence to drive instruction on understanding middle school health enhancement and science concepts. Two nontreatment units were taught in a more traditional teacher-centered teaching style of teaching. The other three treatment units were taught using a variety of strategies driven by the theory of Multiple Intelligences. The data from the Multiple Intelligence Survey showed each students strongest learning style as well as the most challenging style of learning to learn from. The results from the assessment were then categorized by how each piece of curriculum was taught and then compared to the results from the Multiple Intelligence Survey. Due to the data collected from each teacher, the responses from the students within the surveys, and the data from the assessments the project revealed the value of using the theory of Multiple Intelligences to drive instruction.

Studies on new teaching methodologies are show that this classroom design promotes the student's ability to monitor their own progress and feel centered with their learning and not detached. My research reiterated common accounts of student classroom learning and unveiled important information about how well students understood how standards are aligned. The first implementation goal was to use a formative assessment to gather pre and posttest information for the teacher and student. The assessment is a professionally designed and aligned product that gives accurate information on where students are in the skills they have been assessed on. My goal was to see how well students would respond to using the assessment to gather information about their own learning, independent of a structured and timed assessment event. Results showed that the participant students (N=35) who took assessments and tutorials gained 1.6 years in science. Student levels averaged a science mastery of third grade and six months and after the treatment the students averaged at fifth grade and two months. Additional information related to student behaviors and attitudes on learning, assessments and curriculum were brought up through the course of working with the students.

New lectures and lab exercises for a mixed-majors general biology course that focused on plant-people relationships were developed. These activities were hypothesized to improve student attitude and awareness of plants and to increase their motivation to learn more about them. Students were surveyed regarding their interest in plants and regarding their knowledge of local woody plant species both pretreatment and post-treatment. During the non-treatment unit, students were instructed using the traditional lecture method and participated in lab exercises on plant structure. At the end of the unit, a standard exam was used to assess their knowledge. Topics examined during the treatment unit were medicinal plants and teas and relationships amongst plants, soil, water and people. For an introduction to ecology, plant examples were used to illustrate ecological principles wherever possible. The lecture method combined with two short assessments and two out-of-class assignments focusing on these topics. In lab, students completed a drawing exercise, created a woody plant portfolio, and participated in exercises on medicinal properties of plants, and tea brewing and tasting. There was no change in student interest in plant-related topics over the course of this project. Student ability to identify common woody plants and vines significantly improved after developing a plant portfolio. Grades for post-treatment assessment were higher than non-treatment assessment. Instructor motivation to teach botanical topics was low-to-medium at the beginning but was high at the end of this project. A new botany course intended for non-science majors has been proposed using many of the materials and tools from this project.

Over a decade after cleanup of the asbestos-contaminated vermiculite began, Libby area residents continue to experience the related aftermath of widespread asbestos exposure, including asbestos-related disease (ARD) and other chronic illnesses, an ongoing environmental cleanup effort and the conduct of multiple research studies. Effective communication is an essential element of trust and confidence in community-based activities. Although the Libby Community Advisory Group (CAG) was established as a two-way forum for communication and information exchange between the community and agencies involved in providing services to the community, little is known about the community's preferred modes of communication and the community's awareness, knowledge, acceptance and resistance to biomedical and behavioral research. The purpose of this study was to identify concerns, perceptions and preferences of Libby area residents related to research communication, information exchange and other issues pertinent to the community's health and well-being. A retrospective, qualitative analysis of CAG meeting summaries was conducted to identify themes that could lead to a better understanding of critical communication issues between community members and health service providers, policymakers, researchers and agencies involved with the environmental investigation and cleanup of the Libby area. A total of 53 meeting summaries from four years (2001, 2003, 2006 & 2008) representing seminal events in the community were examined. Eleven primary topics of discussion emerged from the data. Libby residents use a variety of communication and information exchange methods, including letters, newspapers and CAG meetings. Face-to-face communication is valued by the community. The community generally has a positive and supportive view of research, and coordination between researchers and local healthcare providers is important to community members. Rural traits and concepts were present in the CAG meetings, including independence, self-reliance, hardiness/resilience, distance/isolation and insider/outsider. Results support research in the Libby community, and emphasize the importance of communication of research opportunities, updates and results and the coordination of research activities with local healthcare agencies. Implications for practice and future research also are presented.	['sociology', 'social sciences', 'civilization', 'auxiliary sciences of history', 'communication']

The Reservation's surface waters have always been greatly respected by the Crow people, valued as a source of life and health and relied upon for drinking water. About fifty years ago, rural families switched to home well water instead of hauling water from the rivers. Many families went from having an unlimited supply of free, good quality river water, to unpalatable well water dependent upon an expensive-to-maintain plumbing system. Tribal members questioned the health of the rivers and well water due to visible water quality deterioration and potential connections to illnesses and initiated this research project. We share what we have learned as tribal members and researchers about conducting community-based risk assessment and using our data to improve Tribal and river health. Initial research on river water quality revealed significant microbial contamination. Collaborations with several microbiologists revealed substantial E. coli and Cryptosporidium river contamination as well as Helicobacter pylori in home water supplies. We found that about 55% of home wells are unsafe to drink due to either mineral and/or microbial contamination. Depending on the river valley, 11% to 58% of home wells exceed the cumulative risk level of concern for mineral contaminants. Exposure to contaminated well water exacerbates the community's existing health disparities due to the confluence of the area's geology, extensive agriculture, lack of public environmental health education, jurisdictional complexities of reservations, already vulnerable health status and families' limited financial resources for mitigating poor quality well water. Limited resources as well as the links among ecosystems, cultural practices and public health will increase the already existing impacts of climate change on reservation communities. Flood frequency, late summer water shortage and fire severity are increasing while water quality is declining. Risk communication and risk mitigation, not just risk assessment, have been and continue to be central to our project and pursued through numerous venues and collaborations.

Wheat contains multiple paralogous and orthologous PPO genes expressed in wheat kernels, Ppo-A1, Ppo-D1, Ppo-A2, Ppo-D2, and Ppo-B2. To date, wheat improvement efforts have focused on breeding cultivars containing Ppo-D1 and Ppo-A1 alleles conferring reduced PPO activity. A major impediment to wheat quality improvement is a lack of additional PPO alleles conferring reduced kernel PPO. Thus, the discovery of novel low or null PPO alleles is critical to further reduce PPO and improve noodle color stability. The objective of this study was to 1) Characterize mutations present in a low PPO line 07OR1074 and create molecular markers associated with newly characterized alleles; 2) assess the allelic impact of the newly characterized alleles on kernel PPO activity and upon Chinese white salted noodle quality. To characterize additional mutations present and develop molecular markers, genomic clones were created for each known PPO gene and sequenced. Previously reported very low PPO line, 07OR1074, was found to contain a novel allele at Ppo-A2 and null alleles at Ppo-A1 and Ppo-D1 loci and molecular markers were created that encompassed each mutation. To determine the allelic impact of the new alleles on kernel PPO activity, F3:4 lines were genotyped with the novel molecular markers, grown in the field in Bozeman, Montana, and assayed for kernel PPO activity. Evaluation of lines indicated a substantial genotypic effect on PPO with Ppo-A1 and Ppo-D1 loci contributing significantly (P <.001) to total PPO. To determine the effect of the null PPO alleles upon noodle quality Chinese white salted noodles were produced from both refined white flour and whole wheat flour. The results clearly demonstrate that the null PPO alleles at Ppo-A1 and Ppo-D1 loci produce noodles that are brighter (greater L*), more red (greater a*), and more yellow (greater b*) at 24 and 48 hours. These results show that mutations in Ppo-A1 and Ppo-D1 genes are important to lowering overall wheat kernel PPO activity producing a more desirable and marketable product.

A limited amount of research regarding possible differences between the metabolism of sucrose (Sucr) and HFCS exists. The purpose of this research was to examine whether a HFCS beverage alters indices of acute resting metabolism when compared to a sucrose beverage. Thirteen (5 male, 8 female: MeanÂ±SD; 23.8 Â± 3 yrs, 71.6 Â± 14.0 kg, 171.0 Â± 11.2 cm) adults from the local area volunteered for this study. After a baseline blood sample was acquired, each subject ingested a 300 milliliter (mL) beverage sweetened with 30 grams (g) of either HFCS or sucrose. Order of treatments was counter-balanced and subjects were blinded. Venous blood samples (approximately 5 mL) were taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, allowed to coagulate for 20 minutes, and then centrifuged for 10 minutes to separate the serum. Samples were analyzed for glucose, lactate, insulin and triglyceride concentrations. An ANOVA with repeated measures was used for statistical analysis and Tukey's post hoc test was used to differentiate means upon a significant interaction. Significance was set at an alpha level < 0.05. Data are listed as mean Â± SD. No interaction effect was observed between time and treatments for any variable. Additionally, no treatment main effect was found for glucose (Sucr 4.13Â±1.1 mM/L, HFCS 4.33Â±1.1 mM/L, p=0.154), lactate (Sucr 2.2Â±0.8, HFCS 2.2Â±0.7, p=0.526), insulin (Sucr 11.13Â±13.0 pmol/L, HFCS 8.18Â±9.6 pmol/L, n=11, p=0.168), or triglycerides (Sucr 80Â±27.8 mg/dL, HFCS 81Â±14.7 mg/dL, p=0.861). There was a significant time effect found within the variables. The mean serum glucose and insulin concentrations at 30 minutes (Glu 5.6 Â± 0.98 mM/L, p<0.001, Ins 22.69Â±17.3 pmol/L, p<0.001) were significantly increased over baseline, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Mean lactate concentration at 30 minutes (2.7Â±0.9 mM/L, p<0.001) was greater than at baseline, 90, and 120 minutes. The triglyceride concentration at 120 minutes was significantly lower than at baseline in both conditions (baseline 84Â±22.1 mg/dL, 120 minutes 76Â±21.6 mg/dL, p=0.008). In the current study, there were no differences between interventions for any of the variables.

In this paper I will compare the techniques used to explain a medical disorder in three different films. What can the filmmaker do to both capture the attention of their audience in order to explain what life can be like for someone with a particular disorder? I argue that, by blending a personal approach with the use of experimental techniques, a filmmaker can appeal to a wider audience by expressing the emotional or experiential reality of living with a given disorder. My own thesis film, Seizing the Unrecorded, shows my own journey to understand how my filmmaking and my epilepsy are connected. Using similar techniques to those found in essay and performative films, I go beyond simply explaining what epilepsy is scientifically, and engage the viewer in larger questions such as the concept of what is memory, what it means to be vulnerable, and the emotional as well as physical costs of epilepsy.

The first model seeks to address the rate at which cells move in or out of the flow in a natural hot spring drainage channel. This is done by building a one- and then two-dimensional partial differential equation model of the stream. The model is parameterized using data gathered at Mushroom Spring in Yellowstone National Park in 2011 and 2012. Using this data, we predict erosion and adhesion rates at steady state in upper and lower regions of the stream. The second model describes the utilization of urea by biofilms in an artificial tube flow reactor. The goal of this model is to determine kinetic parameters for ureolytic biofilms. The model is created by deriving two coupled steady state ordinary differential equations, which are parametrized using experimental data. Once the model is fully described, an inverse problem is formulated and solved using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. From this model we obtain first order kinetic parameters for a particular strain of E. coli, and discuss results for Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These two model systems are linked by a set of intersecting elements. First, both models concern biofilm-lined channels. Second, in each model these biofilms are found in a streamflow system in which some component transfers from the flow to the biofilm or vice-versa. Third, both systems are represented by low dimensional mathematical models which seek to summarize complex physical behaviors using broad, summarizing parameters. Fourth, in both scenarios the parameters of interest are estimated by combining experimental measurements and mathematical modeling. Finally, error plays an important role in model efficacy. The effects of error are implicit in the first model, but explicitly analyzed in the second.

The first intervention was designed to direct participants' attentional focus to the male dominated situation the target woman was working. The second intervention was designed to motivate participants to form more accurate impressions of the target woman. It was predicted that both interventions would eliminate attributional errors and result in more favorable impressions of the target woman in comparison to the female control condition. Additionally, it was expected that when participants were introduced to either intervention, they would form equally favorable impressions of the target woman and man. To test hypotheses, 141 participants viewed a brief virtual webinar where 11 executives from a supposedly large aircraft company spoke about upcoming employee reviews. One of the executives served as the target (AVP of Finance) and in three of the conditions (Accuracy Goal Intervention, Situation Focused Intervention, and Woman Lean In Only) was given a female name and in the fourth (Man Lean In Only) a male name. The intervention was introduced before participants viewed the webinar. Following the webinar participants first completed a free recall questionnaire and answered a number of awareness check questions. Finally, participants completed a battery of backlash measures and demographics. An issue with ordering effects was revealed and alternative analyses were conducted with the free recall items. Results revealed that the Situation Focused Intervention and the two control conditions led to the most favorable impressions of the AVP of Finance. Surprisingly, the accuracy goal intervention led to the least positive impressions of the AVP of Finance in comparison to the other conditions. Results should be interpreted with caution, as the free recall items were not designed to test for backlash.

Yet given the global distribution of volcanoes, their frequency of eruptions, and associated areal extent of disturbance, it is important to understand how amphibians are affected by volcanism. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington State (USA) provides an outstanding opportunity to assess amphibian response to a range of volcanic disturbance types. Reported here is a case study conducted on the Pumice Plain, an area intensely disturbed by a number of volcanic forces that destroyed all pre-eruption life and set the stage for evaluating amphibian community assembly in the context of primary succession. Amphibians were monitored at 25 study sites that included four habitats (pond, lake, wallow, and seep) during summer 2013. Two survey methods were employed (aquatic funnel trap and visual encounter) at each survey site to obtain information on species presence and reproduction. Biophysical habitat characteristics were measured including study site area, elevation, water depth, sediment type, percent cover of vegetation, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, and temperature. Results showed that five amphibian species were present on the Pumice Plain: Rana cascadae, Rana aurora, Pseudacris regilla, Anaxyrus boreas, and Ambystoma gracile. R. cascadae was encountered at 76% of the survey sites, while P. regilla was encountered at 72% of the sites surveyed. A. boreas and A. gracile were found only in the pond and lake habitats, occupying 20% of all sites surveyed. R. aurora is the least frequently encountered species on the Pumice Plain, and present at only 12% of all survey sites. A. boreas and P. regilla are the most abundant species on the Pumice Plain, with the majority of the captures being at the pond habitat. In regards to richness, the ponds contain the most species, with all five species present. Thirty-three years post-eruption, the Pumice Plain supports a diverse assemblage of pond-breeding amphibians. These pond-breeders demonstrated resiliency to intense volcanic disturbance. R. cascadae and P. regilla appear to be the most resilient of the species studied based on their broad distribution across the study sites.

This study focused on if an outdoor river study program increased students' science comprehension and skills more than the normal classroom science curriculum. It also sought out to measure whether students' attitudes towards science and the environment changed from being a part of the study. The data show that while students' knowledge of science concepts did not increase significantly when compared to the indoor classroom unit, students retained the river study concepts better and longer than the classroom science concepts. Students' attitudes towards science and the environment were shown to be more positive post-river study. Students also showed an increased awareness of themselves as learners after the post-river study.

Yet in spite of development of exemplary programs, art in many classrooms is often limited to experimentation with materials, providing breaks in the day for students or teachers. Teacher educators need to consider what training will enable emerging elementary teachers to become competent developers of relevant and purposeful art curriculum (for learning built on knowledge and skills unique to the arts.) The purpose of this qualitative study was to guide, observe, and report on the experiences of Elementary Education (EDEL) Majors in an Elementary Art Methods course within the Education Department at Montana State University. These students were asked to engage in historical/cultural inquiry as members of a group in order to construct contextual understanding of one artwork or art site. Then students were guided through the process of designing curriculum from their insights of the same art prompt. The unit foundation guidelines used were from the Transforming Education Through the Arts Challenge (TETAC), a five-year project completed in 2001. The framework, which emphasizes art integration, was founded on Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE) and Understanding by Design (Wiggins and McTighe, 1998) concepts. The results of this study indicate that emerging teachers have a pre-determined idea about what art is and should be in the classroom. Most EDEL majors say they intend to teach or integrate art but many feel art should be fun activity allowing for free expression. However, when given opportunity to cultivate informed understanding of an artwork, EDEL students were able to design substantive and well-aligned curriculum with meaningful enduring ideas, essential questions, and learning objectives for art skills and knowledge. The findings will encourage educators to approach inquiry in elementary art methods as an information-gathering process appropriate for preparing to teach in any content area. The inquiry process alone did not lead EDEL students to experience epiphany until they began to unpack their ideas according to the structure for unit design. Then one student remarked: ""Pow, suddenly it all made sense!"""

The focus of this project was on teaching and guiding a small group of 10 high school seniors in writing testable scientific questions, ultimately for their own independent research. In addition, I examined ways to improve student understanding of the nature of science (NOS) and assessed how student confidence levels in undertaking scientific research and in writing scientific questions may be impacted. Using a series of teaching modules, group discussion, online data sets and rubric-scored tasks, students practiced and refined the skills needed to become proficient in formulating quality scientific questions. A variety of data collection methods were used in order to gauge student progress and success. These included quizzes, surveys, student interviews and scored assessment tasks. An analysis of the data indicates consequential improvement in the quality of written scientific questions, improved comprehension of nature of science concepts and an overall rise in student confidence."

Furthermore, given that modern advancements have allowed the collection of panel institutional data to become a more reliable procedure, a growing body of empirical research examining several of these theoretical claims has recently begun to flourish. This new empirical literature has given much attention to studying the connection between institutions and economic growth; however, the empirical connection between institutional development and several other important measures of economic performance remains largely unexplored. This thesis partially alleviates this insufficiency by presenting the first empirical study on the relationship between institutional development and private credit riskiness around the world. The analysis consists of applying a variety of model specifications to a select group of panel datasets on institutions. The results obtained suggest that, on average, a higher level of institutional development is associated with interest rate reductions that may, in turn, be due to lower levels of credit riskiness. Moreover, these results appear to be very robust to a wide array of sensitivity tests.

The students were divided into three ability groups: high, medium, and low. The students participated in at least three full WCI assessments and smaller WCI activities over the course of three months. The researcher used surveys, questionnaires, interviews, and observations to collect data and draw conclusions. Results showed that all students developed social and emotional life skills. Not all classes showed similar results however, with certain conditions contributing to greater overall achievement. Factors that may negatively impact success of WCI implementation include students' previous experience with WCI, attitude, and number of students with learning and behavioral disabilities. The study also suggests that students with learning disabilities may need greater teacher direction and support during WCI assessments than other students. In conclusion, the study suggests that WCI is an effective tool for not only teaching science through inquiry, but also teaching students valuable life skills, particularly collaboration and teamwork.

Critical to S. aureus growth is the ability to scavenge iron from hemoglobin (Hb). To acquire iron S. aureus has evolved a sophisticated protein-mediated heme acquisition pathway, which comprises nine iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins involved in heme capture, transport and degradation. A key protein of the acquisition pathway is the hemoglobin receptor protein IsdB, which comprises two NEAr transporter (NEAT) domains that act in concert to bind Hb and extract heme for subsequent transfer to downstream acquisition pathway proteins. Despite significant advances in the structural knowledge of other Isd proteins, the mechanisms and molecular basis of the IsdB-mediated heme acquisition process is not well understood. In order to provide more insights into the mode of function of IsdB, structural studies via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were employed on different domains of IsdB. The three-dimensional solution structure of IsdBN1 revealed an immunoglobulin-like fold that is consistent with other NEAT domain proteins. Site directed mutagenesis studies revealed two key aromatic residues, F164 and Y167, involved in methemoglobin (metHb) interactions with IsdB. The protein variant F164D did not bind to metHb under NMR conditions. In heme transfer studies between metHb and IsdB constructs containing the two NEAT domains and the linker region, the amino acid substitution of F164D diminished but did not knock out the ability of IsdB to remove heme from metHb. A double amino acid substation of F164D and Y167D did abolish heme transfer from metHb to IsdB, therefore identifying key residues of IsdBN1 interaction with metHb. Studies of the linker region revealed an overall alpha-helical propensity and an interaction between the linker region and the second NEAT domain, IsdBN2. Solving the apo-IsdBN2 structure revealed slight differences in the heme-binding pocket, specifically in beta-strands 7 and 8 that interact with the heme moiety, when compared to the published crystal structure of holo-IsdBN2. The findings in this thesis provide a structural role for IsdBN1 enhancing the rate of extraction of heme from metHb by IsdBN2 and interactions between the domains of IsdB.

In the past few decades, nanoparticles have been utilized for use in biomedical applications with a huge impact in enhancing diagnostic techniques. Protein cages and virus-like particles are biological examples of nanoparticles. They are highly symmetric, well-defined architectures made from multiple protein subunits and can be genetically or chemically engineered to impart desired new functionalities and have been used for design of nanomaterials for improving current diagnostic techniques, as discussed in this thesis. One of the main techniques for diagnosis used today is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as it provides good spatial resolution of soft tissues without using harmful ionizing radiation. However, due to poor sensitivity of this technique, contrast agents are often utilized by clinicians to aid in diagnosis of diseased tissues. The main MRI contrast agents used in T1-enhanced imaging are small Gd-containing molecules. Due to the toxicity of free Gd ions, these agents are administered in a tightly chelated form. Even in this form, high doses increase the risk of toxicity. Thus, it is important to reduce overall dosage of these contrast agents. In this thesis, we discuss design principles for virus-like particle based MRI contrast agents as next generation diagnostics which can overcome the above mentioned barriers. Conjugating clinically approved contrast agents to nano-sized virus-like particles changes the intrinsic properties of the contrast agent, directly impacting and increasing MRI contrast. Modifying the interior surface of these cage-like containers to grow functionalizable polymers provides multiple sites for conjugation of small molecule contrast agents, resulting in high payload of these agents. Modifying the exterior surface of these cage-like containers to present targeting ligands and enable them to localize at desired tissues of interest. All three of these design considerations contribute to higher contrast, significantly lower clinical dose requirements, and allow for safe administration of Gd (III) ions for enhanced imaging. As gadolinium-based contrast agents are directly linked with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a rare but deadly disease that causes hardening of tissues and organs, an alternate low-risk metal-complex, Mn (III) porphyrins, has also been explored for bioconjugation to virus-like particles.

70382	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9419	A fiber optic array for the detection of sub-surface carbon dioxide at carbon sequestration sites	A fiber sensor array for sub-surface CO 2 concentrations measurements was developed for monitoring geologic carbon sequestration sites. The fiber sensor array uses a temperature-tunable distributed feedback (DFB) laser outputting a nominal wavelength of 2.004 microns. Light from this DFB laser is directed to one of the four probes via an in-line 1x4 fiber optic switch. Each of the probes is placed underground and utilizes filters that allow only soil gas to enter the probe. Light from the DFB laser interacts with CO 2 within the probe before being directed back through the switch. The DFB laser is tuned across two CO 2 absorption features where a transmission measurement is made, allowing the CO 2 concentration to be retrieved. This process is repeated for each probe, allowing CO 2 concentration measurements to be made as a function of time for each probe. The fiber sensor array was deployed for fifty-eight days at the Zero Emission Research Technology (ZERT) field site and for a twenty-eight day period at the Kevin Dome geologic carbon sequestration site. Background measurements indicate the instrument can monitor background levels as low as 1,000 parts per million (ppm). During a thirty-four day sub-surface CO 2 release, elevated CO 2 concentrations were readily detected by each of the four probes with values ranging to over 60,000 ppm.

Biology may hold the keys necessary to unlocking new technologies that could change how hydrogen is produced. Microbial processes also produce hydrogen and harbor enzymes that carryout the reversible reduction of protons to hydrogen gas. These enzymes are capable of producing hydrogen at high rates comparable to platinum catalysts, but biological hydrogen catalysts can produce hydrogen using abundant elements carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, iron, nickel and selenium. Biological hydrogen catalysts are termed hydrogenases, and though hydrogenases use abundant elements they are extraordinarily complex. This has made it difficult to construct model complexes using inorganic synthesis that can replicate the activities of their biological counterparts. One way to circumvent this problem is to use microbial hydrogen production and let microbes produce and maintain these enzymes inside a cell. Microbial hydrogen production also has the added benefit that hydrogen production could be engineered to connect with other metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and fermentation. Engineering microbes for hydrogen production could eventually allow for the production of hydrogen using inexpensive energy inputs such as solar energy or waste materials. Yet, there are many barriers that need to be overcome in order to engineer a robust microbial organism. One of the primary difficulties of developing this technology has been the oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenases. Hydrogenases when exposed to atmospheric concentrations of oxygen either completely inactivate or their rates are significantly slowed. To engineer a hydrogenase that is more amenable for microbial hydrogen production, the optimization of expressing and purifying hydrogenase enzymes has been developed. Methodologies have been developed to characterize how oxygen inactivates hydrogenase enzymes, and a new methodology has been explored to help find novel hydrogenase gene sequences that may help in engineering oxygen tolerant enzymes.

Spatiotemporal data mining has emerged in recent decades with the main goal focused on developing data-driven mechanisms for the understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics and patterns occurring in the massive repositories of data. This work focuses on discovering spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns (STCOPs) from large data sets with evolving regions. Spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns represent the subset of event types that occur together in both space and time. Major limitations of existing spatiotemporal data mining models and techniques include the following. First, they do not take into account continuously evolving spatiotemporal events that have polygon-like representations. Second, they do not investigate and provide sufficient interest measures for the STCOPs discovery purposes. Third, computationally and storage efficient algorithms to discover STCOPs are missing. These limitations of existing approaches represent important hurdles while analyzing massive spatiotemporal data sets in several application domains that generate big data, including solar physics, which is an application of our interdisciplinary research. In this work, we address these limitations by i) introducing the problem of mining STCOPs from data sets with extended (region-based) spatial representations that evolve over time, ii) developing a set of novel interest measures, and iii) providing a novel framework to model STCOPs. We also present and investigate three novel approaches to STCOPs mining. We follow this investigation by applying our algorithm to perform a novel data-driven discovery of STCOPs from solar physics data.

70385	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9429	Characterization of airflow through an air handling unit using computational fluid dynamics	HVAC equipment manufacturers spend a considerable amount of time and effort updating existing product lines in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy efficient systems. As a major part of HVAC systems, an air handling unit (AHU) controls the airflow through the system and regulates the indoor air quality. Plenum fans used in AHUs inherently produce a rotational airflow, which can create highly unstructured airflow as it enters a heat exchanger located downstream. This in turn leads to lower heat transfer rates and premature heat exchanger failure. As such, airflow uniformity is presently regarded as an important consideration in designing these systems. Through advancements in computer technologies within the last decade, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an economical solution allowing HVAC equipment designers to numerically model prototypes and reduce the time required to optimize a given design and identify potential failure points. While CFD analysis also offers the ability to visualize and characterize the airflow through an AHU system, it has often been used to model individual components such as fans or heat exchangers without analyzing them as a single unit. This work presents the CFD models used to characterize the airflow within an AHU in order to aid in understanding the effects that flow uniformity has on heat exchanger performance. The airflow uniformity was analyzed over a range of volumetric flow rates, and experiments were used to validate the baseline simulations. Different baffle designs were then added into the validated simulations to observe their influence on both airflow uniformity and heat transfer performance. Results indicate that airflow uniformity is, by itself, an insufficient metric to predict heat transfer performance. Additionally, steady-state CFD analyses performed on simplified geometries are shown to provide a sufficient model to be used for further optimization, when the inlet conditions are well specified.

This can result in complex, time-expensive calculations to simulate surface interactions when simulating physical processes or rendering images. This thesis describes a computational geometric model based on discrete uniform-volume elements (univels), and applies this approach to well-known problem: using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the transport physics of neutral particles (neutrons and photons) through complex geometric models. The most consequential product of this work is Juniper, a comprehensive transport modeling software system useful for both practical applications and experimental research in particle transport. Using a structured Cartesian grid of univels has several promising advantages: tracking particles through a univel grid is known to be much faster than alternative geometries. And univel-based particle tracking is particularly insensitive to the complexity of the geometric model. To use these advantages Juniper must rasterize the input model into univels. Antialiasing is a well-known technique in computer graphics to reduce the visual impact of discretization artifacts. In existing graphics applications this is almost entirely done with three-dimensional color vectors. Juniper is designed to explore antialiasing the geometry univelization, while developing novel ways to cope with high-dimensionality material vectors. Antialiasing creates blended vectors near high-frequency information areas of the rasterization grid. When the grid is an image the vectors are on a three-dimensional color space and can often be stored and interpreted directly. But for particle transport the univel values are high-dimensionality material vectors. An exact representation of their blended forms yields impractically large model sizes. Instead, these vectors can be quantized to a manageable set of prototype vectors, reducing the univel grid to a table of indices. The quantized material vectors retain the computational advantages of univelized particle transport while potentially improving the fidelity of the transport results. Exploring this problem has provided new insights into digitization of high-dimensional values, effects of univel size on transport result accuracy, and the antialiasing of high-dimensional vector spaces. A new library of carefully defined high-precision cargo object models in a universal format (XML) is another result.

This mixed methods study documents the process of implementing a family involvement program at a rural school serving predominantly low-income families near an American Indian reservation. The results showed there is a strong sense of responsibility among the parents for the education of their children. Parents and students were found to work together to improve their learning by reviewing homework together and doing learning activities at home. Interview data stressed the importance of developing a welcoming learning environment at school and at afterschool events that is culturally sensitive. Families need to feel they are welcomed and respected. The structure of afterschool events must be flexible and familiar for continued participation. Facilitators of family involvement programs in American Indian communities need to design programs that are culturally responsive to the local tribe and community, supporting the comfort and learning of the participants, providing materials for everyone to take home, and bringing the program to the people.

Although carbon dioxide makes up most of the greenhouse gas emissions, methane has a much greater impact on climate change due to its warming potential on a per molecule basis. Improved understanding of the spatial distribution of methane is necessary to quantify the anthropogenic impacts and mitigate future damage. A differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is proposed for spatially mapping methane concentrations. The system requires a laser transmitter that can produce over 3 mJ of pulse energy with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and output wavelength of 1.654 micron as well as a narrow linewidth on the order of 3 MHz. Modeling predicts that a system with these specifications can achieve measurement error of less than 2% relative to ambient levels of methane. Laser sources with these specifications are not commercially available, and the goal of this work is to evaluate the potential for a singly-resonant optical parametric oscillator (OPO) for the DIAL laser transmitter. The OPO is based on large-aperture periodically-poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate as the nonlinear optical material. Results from the OPO indicate that energies on the order of 1 mJ are possible with the experimental setup presented when operating at 20 Hz repetition rate. The OPO produced a linewidth of 10.5 GHz, measured on a system with resolution of 6.6 GHz. Future work includes optimization of the OPO to increase the output energy from the system to 3 mJ by improving mode-matching into the cavity and increasing the energy into the system. Additionally a method to precisely measure the linewidth of the OPO output is necessary as well as a pump laser that operates at 1 kHz to test the performance of the OPO at 1 kHz. The initial results show promise for the use of the OPO as the DIAL laser transmitter and with improvements, the OPO should meet the requirements for the DIAL system.

Vegetation and soils capture and store these emissions, however not nearly in the quantity being emitted. Disparity between sources and sinks of CO 2 emissions requires actions focused on reducing CO 2 emissions (CCSP, 2007). Cabin Creek Ranch, near Shepherd, MT offers a rich opportunity to understand the current carbon balance within various land cover types, and to determine the effect that cropping, grazing and concentrated feeding has on the potential for ranch soils to sequester additional carbon. Samples were collected from 30 soil and 16 vegetation locations, which were randomly chosen in a variety of cover types. Soil samples were taken every 15 cm throughout the soil profile (down to 100 cm, if possible). Four .25 m 2 frames were used to collect herbaceous material 25 meters in each cardinal direction from soil pit center. Clay and land cover type were found to have a significant interaction on the organic carbon content in the soils (p=0.021). Additionally, dryland crop was found to be significantly different in organic carbon content compared to other cover types (p<0.0001). Therefore, management towards a specific land cover type could help mitigate CO 2 emissions. For example, revegetating dryland crop fields to a native grassland, sagebrush or forest, the landscape would be able to store 230%, 232% and 256% more organic carbon, respectively. Understanding the carbon balance on the landscape scale contributes to understanding the global carbon balance to help mitigate burning of fossil fuels.

Unlike ""social issue documentaries,"" which are often produced to simply increase awareness around an issue, newer forms of advocacy documentaries not only strive to educate the viewer on an issue, but also to engage the viewer in specific actions. New media and digital technology provide novel tools for documentary filmmakers interested in creating these changes. Not all documentarians have the goal of creating change, nor should they. But for those that do fall into this category, there are certain approaches and tools that are invaluable for creating impact, as well as measuring the outcome. Ideally, the advocacy documentarian should consider the framework that is available and how to best utilize the available tools and methods to obtain the most successful outcome, and should do so well before onset of production. I analyze the leading approaches that successful contemporary advocacy documentaries have employed, as well as some of the pitfalls that others have faced. After identifying the defining characteristics of ""successful"" advocacy films, I analyze several advocacy documentaries to illustrate how these methods and approaches are utilized, as well as some measurable impacts.

The primary sources of uncertainty for farmers are weather, fluctuations in prices, and site-specific environmental and ecological variability, some of which may be amplified by climate change. To effectively respond to the risks posed by these uncertainties requires knowledge of the vulnerability of these agricultural systems. The aim of this dissertation was to meet this need for Montana by analyzing the economic resilience of the state dryland agricultural systems at site-specific and county-wide scales. To begin, a framework was created to integrate weather, prices, nitrogen inputs, and spatial soil variability within a statistical model for site-specific crop responses and net returns. Simulations suggest that six crop years of simulated data collection and parameter tuning were required to derive an accurate model, suggesting that an extended period of observation and targeted nitrogen rate experimentation was required to optimize spatial fertilizer management. The framework was subsequently applied to a spatiotemporal precision agricultural dataset from a farm near Great Falls, MT, and was modified to account for several crop rotations and different farmer risk preferences. Regardless of farmers' level of risk aversion, winter wheat-pea rotations resulted in higher value (utility) for the farmer than winter wheat-fallow and continuous winter wheat rotations. For most levels of risk adversity, it was also optimal to apply no nitrogen fertilizer. Net returns at the field site were always threatened by drought. Subsequently, a qualitative analysis of farmer adaptability in Montana based on survey and interview data determined that farmers had few options for responding to drought but were more adaptable to high input prices. On-farm experimentation and crop rotations could greatly increase adaptability in the future. Finally, simulations of alternative price, precipitation, and crop rotation scenarios were completed. The most resilient agricultural systems were located in northeastern Montana where pulses have been more widely adopted; systems in north-central Montana were less resilient. State-wide, over 50% of dryland farmers may not be resilient to future economic or climatic variability.

The U.S. spends about one tenth of our healthcare dollars on diabetes and its complications. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to other serious conditions such as kidney failure and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes is a chronic disease that can be managed by maintaining a steady blood glucose level with the aid of medication, proper diet, and exercise. With proper ongoing diabetic self-management education patients have better control of their diabetes and are more likely to follow best practice treatment recommendations. The local problem at Big Sky Family Medicine is that only 50% of their diabetic patients are in good control with their HbA1C at less than 7%. The microsystem assessment revealed there was no standardized approach to diabetes care and management. A literature review was done to identify best practice for diabetes management. Care that was patient centered, provided care coordination and ongoing diabetic self-management education proved effective. The general aim of this project was to improve the effectiveness of diabetes care at BSFM. A proposed protocol was developed and an ideal process was created as shown in figure 2. Standardized teaching materials are identified along with pre and post testing forms to identify patient knowledge and satisfaction. The evaluation of the protocol will be based primarily on the improvement of the patients HbA1c readings along with BP readings, LDL results, and increase in patient knowledge and satisfaction. The evaluation of the protocol will be based primarily on the improvement of the patients HbA1c readings along with BP readings, LDL results, and increase in patient knowledge and satisfaction. A CNL would be the ideal choice to implement this protocol due to their ability to design, implement and evaluate change along with the ability to coordinate and delegate patient care.

Klee participated in and was influenced by a range of artistic movements including surrealism, cubism, and expressionism, but was not faithful to any one particular movement. The one element that is consistent throughout his work is his use of comic themes. My research revolves around the evolution of comedic theater techniques used as formal elements in the works of Paul Klee. While many scholars comment on Klee's sense of humor, and his use of irony and wit, comedy, as a set theatrical conventions, has not been thoroughly analyzed. There is a strong presence of the theater in Klee's work that has been addressed in recent scholarship but not in terms of the comedic. The 2006 exhibition, ""Paul Klee: Theater Everywhere"" chronicled his wide-ranging references to theater, but it did not analyze the role of comic theater's particular traditions and the pictorial conventions derived from them. In this study, I will assess Klee's application of comic theatrical traditions as innovative strategies for constructing visual compositions. Separating his works into cohesive study sets that include: early satirical works, masks, puppets, and performers, theatrical landscapes, hand puppets and small stage sets, and Klee's years at the Bauhaus. While Klee used satirical and cathartic devices that date back to classical Greek theater, I will concentrate on the ways that Klee used the technical apparatuses of modern theatrical comedy as formal devices for his two-dimensional compositions. I am specifically interested in his use of the alienating techniques of Bertolt Brecht's ""epic theater"" and the relief-like stage of the Kunstlertheater. As consistently as his work changes through his development as an artist, comedy is a factor that consistently carries through."

One such technology is the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). SOFCs convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy, so they can be much more efficient than traditional sources of electrical power generation. SOFCs utilize an oxide-ion conducting electrolyte to generate electricity by reducing molecular oxygen at the cathode and oxidizing fuel at the anode. High temperatures (<650 Â°C) are required to catalyze oxide conduction through the electrolyte. High temperatures enable SOFCs to use a variety of fuels, but these same conditions also accelerate unfavorable reactions that can cause anode degradation. Research described in this dissertation examined the effects of carbon accumulation in SOFC anodes on overall device performance, and the spatial variation in anode degradation. Fuel was introduced to the fuel cell using a single fuel inlet. This method of fuel introduction created spatial variance in factors such as fuel concentration, and this variance was expected to affect carbon accumulation on the anode. Carbon accumulation is a major contributor to anode degradation through a variety of mechanisms including mass transport obstruction, anode delamination from the electrolyte, and metal dusting, a process describing anode disintegration induced by carbon growth disrupting the anode's electronically conducting network. The amount of carbon accumulation on the surface of the anode was analyzed in operando using Raman spectroscopy. Spectroscopic results showed that more carbon accumulated on the anode further from the fuel inlet than closer to it. In situ electrochemical measurements coupled with post mortem visual and FEM analysis suggested that severe anode degradation occurred early in an experiment, affecting spectroscopic results. We infer that the highest amount of carbon accumulation occurs close to the fuel inlet causing fast and severe anode degradation, decreasing the amount of carbon that can accumulate in further trials when the majority of the spectroscopic data was collected. These results suggest that spectroscopic results should be analyzed with experimental factors such as anode location and trial sequence specifically in mind.

E. coli can be mutualistic or pathogenic that cause diarrheal disease (diarrheagenic E. coli, DEC). The colonization of E. coli begins with the successful adherence to intestinal epithelial cell (IECs); which is mediated by a variety of colonization factors on the bacterial cell surface. This is the first and most crucial step for E. coli colonization. Therefore, valuable model systems to study E. coli should recapitulate this adherence. Several model systems have been developed and successful reproduce adherence and other important aspects of EPEC pathogenesis, but have significant limitations. However, human intestinal organoids (HIOs) are a 3-dimensional tissue culture composed of a single layer of mature, differentiated, columnar epithelial cells that surround a lumen. When compared to traditional cell cultures, animal models and ligated intestines, HIOs have the potential to be more representative human physiology. Here, we begin to demonstrate the use of HIOs as an in vitro model to study E. coli. We hypothesized that HIOs could be used to study epithelial colonization dynamics of E. coli. In this study, we established working protocols for a novel experimental approach for investigating attachment factors involved in E. coli attachment. HIOs are generated from embryonic or pluripotent stem cells into definitive endoderm that gives rise to 3-dimensional structures. These structures were routinely cultured to a diameter of approximately 3.0 mm and embedding in matrigel. An overnight culture of the prototypic EPEC strain, e2348/69 (O127:H6) was transfected with a plasmid carrying a green fluorescent protein that provided visualization by fluorescent microscopy. Approximately, 2.4 x 10 6 CFU was injected into individual HIOs using a microinjector and incubated for 12 hours at 35Â°C and 5% CO 2. HIOs were then fixed and either stained for fluorescence imaging or processed in 1% osmium tetroxide for examination by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM). The observations that EPEC was intimately associated with the intestinal epithelium, supports the use HIO for E. coli colonization investigations.

From cowboy and Indian Westerns, to desperate dust bowl narratives, to southern plains and country living, Hollywood tells only the stories of what Oklahoma can and does represent to the rest of the country - rife with stereotypes and realities alike. Cities are not prominent in Oklahoma films, with scenic country landscapes providing the stage for the action. Hollywood films set in Oklahoma are centered around the landscape, and many are unique in that their stories cannot be told in any other geographic location in the country. This is due in part to many of these mainstream films being adaptations of primary sources that explicitly state the setting as Oklahoma, and accounts for the development of the depiction of the landscape as a character in such films.

Researchers have defined temperament as behavioral responses to a perceived stressful event. ""Fight-or-Flight"" response is influenced by environmental and genetic factors including age, sex, and breed. Subjective chute scoring systems have been used by many researchers. Due to the subjectivity and associated variability among observers, chute scores have been questioned for repeatability and consistency. An alternative measurement currently used, is exit velocity or speed at which an animal exits a chute, and is recognized as the most practical objective measure for assessing temperament. Physiological markers used to evaluate temperament are increased blood cortisol and lactate concentrations. The first objective of this study was to compare temperament differences between feedlot steers and heifers. The second objective was to evaluate physiological measures taken chute side as potential markers for defining an animal's temperament and potential predictor. Pulse, oxygen saturation, rectal temperature, blood lactate, blood glucose and lactate concentrations, salivary cortisol, and serum cortisol were measured on mixed breed and sex feedlot cattle (n = 197), significant difference alpha = P< 0.05 . Exit velocities were used to classify animals as fast, medium, and slow, plasma lactate was significantly different between all classes. Exit velocity and physiological measures differed between sex. Heifers had higher exit velocities (P = 0.003), plasma lactate concentrations (p = 0.03), and cortisol concentrations (P = 0.001). Simple correlations among these variables showed rectal temperature (heifers r = 0.44, P <0.0001; steers 0.45 P < .0001), plasma lactate (heifers r = 0.52 P < 0.0001; steers r = 0.63 P < 0.0001), serum lactate (heifers r = 0.53 P < 0.001; steers r = 0.59 P < 0.001) and glucose (heifers r = 0.54 P < 0.001; steers r = 0.32 P <0.003) were all correlated to exit velocity in both sexes. Cortisol measures were not correlated to exit velocity in steers but were in heifers. Linear models were constructed and evaluated using Akaike information criterion, the top candidate model was plasma lactate in combination with body temperature to predict exit velocity."

70398	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9456	Continuation approaches for nonlinear least squares	Output error (OE) minimization is a commonly-used method for parameter estimation. It has the virtues that under reasonable conditions, the parameter estimates it produces are good (often maximum-likelihood) and only a simulation model is required to compute the predictions (making it equally useful for linear and nonlinear systems). Unfortunately, the procedure for computing the OE parameter estimates involves the minimization of a nonlinear cost function which requires the use of an iterative nonlinear least-squares (NLLS) algorithm such as Gauss- Newton. The present work begins with the observation that the one-step linear prediction error (PE) method - for which the parameter estimates can be computed via linear least-squares but suffers from noise-related bias - can be viewed as a particular transformation of the OE residuals. Further, that this transformation can be parameterized in such a way that a continuation of residual sequences is available that combines the properties of PE and OE. Minimizing a sequence of the cost functions associated with this continuation is shown to be a reliable method for finding the OE global minimum. It is later shown that the continuation need not begin with PE and that, in principle, any linear transformation of the OE residuals may be used provided that the resulting sequence of cost function global minima meet certain criteria. These criteria are provided in the form of a theorem which, in turn, makes use of the Implicit Function Theorem, an elementary result from analysis. The result is a method for guaranteeing that the continuation procedure has converged on the OE global minimum given a linear transformation has been chosen. No closed-form solution is given for the design of the transformation, but two designs are provided and shown to be successful on test problems.

The purpose of this project was to determine specific stages of the reproductive cycle of female NBR bison that may be responsible for low reproductive rate and calf production. The reproductive cycle was divided into 3 stages: conception to early embryogenesis; gestation; and perinatal calf survival. From 2008 to 2010, we used transrectal ultrasonography to determine pregnancy rate in cows ages 3 to 12 yr in October of each year. Sixty-eight percent (28/41), 63% (56/89) and 71% (50/70) were pregnant in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In 2008, pregnant cows were painted with a unique number using hair bleach. Fecal samples collected in Oct. 2008, and Jan. and Mar., 2009, were analyzed for progesterone (P4) concentrations. Because bleach marks did not persist through calving, in 2009 radio collars were secured to 27 pregnant and 10 non-pregnant cows. Fecal samples collected in Oct. 2009, and Jan., March, Apr., and May, 2010, were analyzed for P4 concentrations. Based on fecal P4 analyses, 26% of cows pregnant in October 2008 lost their pregnancy during the winter 2009. In 2009, 26 pregnant cows retained their collars. Of these, we confirmed 23 produced calves, suggesting a 12% (3/26) loss during gestation. Furthermore, 2 (20%) cows classified non-pregnant by ultrasonography in Oct. produced a calf demonstrating bison females may breed later than early September. Serum samples of breeding-age cows collected during the 2000 to 2007 roundups were also analyzed for serum P4 concentrations to assess herd-wide corpora lutea (CL) activity. Serum P4 during roundup was highly correlated (R Â² = 0.89; P < 0.05) with calf production the following year, indicating fall estrus cycling with CL production as the likely major determinant of calf production. Body weights (BW) of 4- to 7-year old cows during roundup from 1999 to 2008 were highly correlated (R Â² = 0.98; P < 0.05) to calf production the following year, indicated that the changes in calf production and fall estrus cycling were likely related to cow body weights. Calf production recovered to 56% and 67% in 2009 and 2010, respectively. However, historic records from 1956 to 2010 revealed calf production began declining around 1980. In conclusion, the decrease in calf production at the NBR appears to be due primarily to the number of breeding-age females that exhibit breeding and ovulatory activity during the breeding season, presumably due to cow body condition. The specific causes for these effects are not known but may be related to range resources.	['life sciences', 'reproduction', 'physiology', 'sex (biology)', 'biology', 'life (biology)', 'science']

The passage of the Bahy-Dole Act in the early 1980s, greatly assisted university-industry partnerships, generated the use of knowledge and inventions that came out of government sponsored research, and allowed universities to retain the intellectual properties instead of the federal government. In 1985, the NSF initiated the Engineering Research Center (ERC) Program to develop additional university-industry partnerships. The NSF intention is that Engineering Research Centers will become self-sustaining after the eleven years of NSF funding with an increase of research partnerships with industry and other federal agencies. This dissertation is a comparative case study of two NSF Engineering Research Centers. The Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE), at Montana State University, that has graduated from NSF funding, and has become a self-sustaining research Center with 23 current industrial members. The second ERC is the University of Michigan, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSystems, which is in the fourth year of NSF funding with 19 industrial members. The main question that was answered in the comparative case study is what are the best practices that resulted in building and maintaining industrial partnerships? Center faculty market the ERC through their publications, and presenting at conferences where industrial representatives are informed of Center research. Other methods are visiting company sites, producing quality research, inviting industrial personnel to the ERC to meet with faculty and to attend ERC workshops. The elicitation of the company research problem from industrial personnel by Center faculty is important for maintaining Center membership. Multiple champions within the company must be cultivated to insure against losing a champion to retirement or company transfer. The Center Director of the CBE publishes and travels extensively to conferences and provides the best leads, while the Center for WIMS faculty thrust leaders, and the UM Corporate Relations personnel provide the best leads for prospective new members. Industrial members mainly join an ERC for knowledge, to perform collaborative research with faculty, and to have access to faculty and students.

The catalytic center of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases is called the H-cluster, and is characterized by a [4Fe-4S] cluster connected via a cysteine thiolate to a 2Fe subcluster coordinated by carbon monoxide and cyanide ligands as well as a bridging dithiolate. Assembly of the H-cluster is carried out by three hydrogenase maturation proteins: HydE, HydF, and HydG. HydF is a GTPase and has been implicated to serve as a scaffold for assembly of the 2Fe subcluster of the H-cluster. HydE and HydG are radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes and thus are thought to utilize reductive cleavage of SAM to initiate radical chemistry. HydG has been shown to catalyze the formation of the carbon monoxide and cyanide ligands of the H-cluster utilizing tyrosine as a substrate. HydE, therefore, has been proposed to be responsible for biosynthesis of the dithiolate ligand of the H-cluster. The aim of this study was to biochemically characterize active, Fe-S reconstituted HydE and to identify the substrate of this radical SAM enzyme. Questions to be studied also included studying the role of HydE in H-cluster maturation. This study used protein purified from recombinant E. coli. The purified protein was chemically reconstituted with iron and sulfide, and used for spectroscopic characterization and HPLC based activity assays. Colorimetric assays were also used for protein characterization and to test for the consumption of substrate. The results indicate that cysteine is likely the substrate of HydE. Activity assays show that HydE- catalyzed SAM cleavage is stimulated in the presence of cysteine, and HydF purified from different genetic backgrounds shows a spectroscopic shift in the lambda max when both HydE and cysteine are present during growth. Spectroscopic characterization confirms that HydE is an Fe-S containing radical SAM enzyme and that cysteine may be a substrate during [FeFe]-hydrogenase H-cluster maturation.

The participants related their experiences through a series of open ended questions. The first interview established information about and initial impressions of the boarding school, including everyday activities and how the women felt about being away from home. The second interview allowed the women to describe the impact the boarding school had on their emotional growth and maturation. The final interview discussed how they presently function in their daily lives and the relationship it has to their experiences at boarding school. The study found that the boarding school experience produced intergenerational effects, particularly on their ability to love themselves and to nurture their children and families. The second finding was that the psychological punishment of loneliness and alienation from the family had a far greater impact on the individuals than the physical punishment. The third finding was that although the women who attended boarding schools were prepared with the skills to lead productive lives, they could not do so effectively until they had begun healing from their experiences. The final conclusion of this study was that by speaking and telling their stories, the participants believed that they could bring healing to themselves and to other women who have had similar experiences at boarding schools.

This structuring is generally believed to be the result of both the arrangement of the magnetic field in the corona and the distribution of plasma along magnetic loops. The standard model of solar flares involves plasma transported into coronal loops via a process known as chromospheric evaporation, and the resulting evolution of the are loops is believed to be sensitive to the physical mechanism of energy input into the chromosphere by the are. We present here the results of three investigations into chromospheric plasma flows driven by solar are energy release and transport. First, we develop a 1-D hydrodynamic code to simulate the response of a simplified model chromosphere to energy input via thermal conduction from reconnection-driven shocks. We use the results from a set of simulations spanning a parameter space in both shock speed and chromospheric-to-coronal temperature ratio to infer power-law relationships between these quantities and observable evaporation properties. Second, we use imaging and spectral observations of a quasi-periodic oscillation of a are ribbon to determine the phase relationship between Doppler shifts of the ribbon plasma and the oscillation. The phase difference we find leads us to suggest an origin in a current sheet instability. Finally, we use imaging and spectral data of an on-disk are event and resulting are loop plasma flows to generally validate the standard picture of are loop evolution, including evaporation, cooling time, and draining downflows, and we use a simple free-fall model to produce the first direct comparison between observed and synthetic downflow spectra.

Riparian and stream habitats are particularly susceptible to effects of poorly-managed livestock grazing. About 80% of stream and riparian habitats in the western United States are thought to have been damaged by livestock grazing, but because grazing usually pre-dated assessments of fish populations and stream habitats, before and after comparisons are impossible. The spatial and temporal complexity of livestock grazing make it difficult to isolate its effects on instream habitat and channel morphology characteristics. Moreover, instream habitat and channel morphology are also influenced by inherent watershed characteristics (i.e., basin area, gradient, discharge). I assessed the effects of livestock grazing on 25 separate 150-m long sample sites (1400 to 1585 m in elevation) within ten headwater basins along the northeastern Rocky Mountain Front in north-central Montana. I used scat counts as an index of relative grazing intensity to assess the effects of livestock grazing on channel morphology characteristics, stream substrate, instream cover, and trout biomass. To my knowledge, this effort is the first to quantify livestock grazing intensity using scat counts to assess grazing effects on trout biomass. I assessed potential effects that grazing intensity had on habitat condition and fish biomass using linear mixed models, which also accounted for watershed and sample site effects. I found that the proportion of fine sediment in the streambed increased as the number of scats increased (P < 0.001), but the area of undercut banks declined as scat counts increased (P < 0.001). Estimated trout biomass declined as number of scats increased, even when I accounted random effects of stream and year in a linear mixed-effect model (P = 0.009). My results corroborate previous findings that livestock grazing along stream channels may reduce trout biomass, but unlike previous studies I actually quantified grazing intensity using scat counts. Since increased livestock grazing intensities were related to increased levels of fine sediments in streambeds and smaller areas of undercut streambanks, I suggest that these factors may be related to why increased livestock grazing reduced trout biomass.

The goal of my thesis was to design and test an intervention focused on perceived true self-knowledge, or the feeling of knowing who one really is. I hypothesized that increasing perceived true self-knowledge would decrease depression, anxiety, and risky alcohol use. Undergraduate students (N= 91) first completed an online survey that included baseline measurements of anxiety, depression and alcohol use. The day after completing this baseline survey, participants were randomly assigned to complete conditions of the intervention. The intervention phase consisted of four days of writing tasks. Participants in the true self-knowledge intervention condition identified characteristics that define who they truly are daily for four consecutive days. Participants in the control condition did the same thing but were asked to identify office supplies. Two-weeks following the intervention, participants (N=61) completed a second survey that assessed anxiety, depression, and alcohol use. I hypothesized that, controlling for baseline, participants in the true self-knowledge condition would report lower levels of anxiety, depression, and alcohol use compared to the control condition. The results indicated that the intervention did not successfully increase perceived true self-knowledge. Additionally, the results did not support my hypothesis. The only significant effect to emerge was an unexpected increase in the self-reported number of drinks consumed in a typical drinking event among those in the true self-knowledge intervention condition. The limitations of the intervention and potential avenues for future research are discussed.	['persons', 'students', 'college students']

Changes in student attitude and performance were measured using pre and post treatment surveys and assessments. After the Proportions Project, student performance improved by up to 28% at tasks incorporating multiple variables and unit conversions. The majority of students also reported better study skills, better understanding of the role of mathematics in the study of chemistry, and a perception of chemistry as more relevant to their daily lives.

Elemental sulfur (SÂ°) is associated with many geothermal springs, yet little is known about the organisms involved in its cycling. The aqueous and solid phase geochemistry near the source of Dragon Spring, an ASC spring in the Norris Geyser Basin (NGB) of YNP, was used to guide the enrichment and isolation of two novel SÂ°-reducing Crenarchaeota affiliated with the order Desulfurococcales. Both isolates are chemoorganotrophs, dependent on complex peptide-containing carbon sources, SÂ°, and anaerobic conditions for respiration-dependent growth. Physiological characterization suggests the isolates are adapted to the physicochemical conditions of Dragon Spring which is supported by quantitative PCR analysis which indicates that the isolates represent a significant fraction of the microbial community associated with SÂ° precipitates in several ASC geothermal springs in the NGB in YNP. Both isolates are capable of utilizing naturally-occurring, complex forms of carbon as a carbon and energy source, and naturally-formed SÂ° as terminal electron acceptor for respiration-dependent growth, suggesting a role for these microbes in the biological cycling of carbon and sulfur in these environments. Our understanding of the flow of carbon, energy, and other materials between microbial producer species and heterotrophic consumers is limited, in particular in geothermal systems. Novel invertebrate larvae related to Odontomyia sp. (Stratiomyidiae: Diptera) were observed grazing microbial mat biomass in several ASC geothermal springs in the NGB. DNA-based methods were used to demonstrate that stratiomyid larvae graze interstitial algal populations within the mat biomass. Results also indicate that the biomass grazed by larvae contained elevated levels of monomethylated Hg (MeHg) and total mercury (THg). As a consequence of grazing the mat biomass, larvae biomagnified MeHg in their tissues at 2.7- to 5.5-times the concentrations measured in mat biomass. The results of this analysis indicate the Killdeer contained MeHg at a concentration 4.64-fold greater than larval tissue. Collectively, this data suggests that larval grazing behavior represents a key pathway for the transfer of MeHg to species within a geothermal mat-based food web.

Catch-and-release angling (CR) studies have reported high levels (30-40%) of salmonid mortality at water temperatures >20Â°C, but few studies assess CR mortality of salmonids at water temperatures observed in Montana streams during mid-summer (23Â°C). The primary objective of this study was to measure CR mortality of rainbow trout, brown trout, and mountain whitefish in three water temperature treatments; when daily maximum water temperatures were cool (<20Â°C), warm (20 to 22.9Â°C), and hot (23Â°C). A secondary objective was to assess CR mortality of salmonids angled in morning and evening within water temperature treatments. Based on the literature, mortality of salmonids was predicted to be >30% within the hot treatment and higher in evening than morning. Angling (fly-fishing only) occurred in the Gallatin and Smith rivers. All angled fish were confined to in-stream holding cages and monitored for mortality for 72 h. Mortality of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss increased to 9% and 16% in warm and hot treatments, respectively. Mortality of brown trout Salmo trutta was (4%) in the hot treatment in the Smith River. Mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni had increased mortality in the warm (20%) and hot (28%) treatments in the Smith River. No mortality for any species occurred in either river when water temperatures were <20Â°C. Mortality of rainbow trout angled in evening was higher than morning in the warm (14%) and hot (16%) treatments in the Smith River. Laboratory results indicated rainbow trout stressed in evening had higher mortality (7%) than those stressed in morning (0%). Angler catch rates were lower for most species in evening than morning angling events; however, catch rates remained high (0.7 fish/h) in several evening angling events. Study results indicate that salmonid mortality rates associated with catch-and-release fly-fishing are higher at elevated (>or equal to 23Â°C) water temperatures. Although there was a relationship between elevated water temperature and salmonid mortality, most of the mortality estimates were well below the 30% mortality that was predicted.	['mortality']

In the case of Easter Island, documentary filmmakers have sensationalized the history of the Rapa Nui people, dwelling on dramatic concepts such as eco-disaster, cannibalism and mysteriously vanishing cultures. As a result of poor filmmaking, we have a mythologized history of Easter Island. In my attempt to create a science-based documentary about an issue affecting contemporary Easter Island society, this mythologizing of history became a major obstacle. It became apparent that I had to first inform audiences to the fact that they had been misinformed by previous documentaries about Easter Island and I had to change their interpretation of the alleged facts. In my thesis paper I examine the documentaries that created sensational statements about the island and reveal why documentary filmmakers rely on dramatic elements. I also examine my approach to the process of making my graduate thesis film, Caballo Loco on Easter Island, and review the methods I used to ensure the people of Rapa Nui were accurately represented.

Combination of metal L-edge and ligand K-edge XAS has the potential to define the experimental ground state electronic structure. We developed a quantitative treatment for Pd L-edge spectroscopy based on the already established Cl K-edge XAS for a series of chloro palladium complexes, which are precatalysts in numerous organic transformations. We found that Pd-Cl bonds are highly covalent (23% per Cl in [PdClâ]Â²â», 34% per Cl in [PdClâ]Â²â», and 46% in PdClâ). Dipole integrals for Pd(2p..4d) transitions of 42 eV for Pd(II) and 48 eV for Pd(IV) LIII-edges and 39 eV and 35 eV, respectively, at these Pd oxidation states for the LII-edges were determined. Application of the metal-ligand covalencies and transition dipole integrals by describing the ground state bonding in PdClâ with bridging Cl ligands was demonstrated. In future studies, a similar approach will be utilized for palladium phosphine, allyl, olefin complexes in order to define their experimental electronic structure and correlate this with their observed reactivity.

Noncompetitive bidding may lead to lower than fair market values of timber and thus large losses in federal revenues. Knowing where noncompetitive bidding is most likely to occur may allow the Forest Service to effectively mitigate noncompetitive bidding and antitrust resources to be allocated efficiently. A multi-stage procedure is developed for identifying the market areas where bidding is least competitive. The third stage of the procedure introduces an innovative method for analyzing the competitiveness of bidding behavior. This new method compares the differential impacts of regular and nonregular bidders on bid price. The application of the multi-stage procedure to nine forests in Washington and Oregon reveals noncompetitive bidding may have been present in two forests between 1973 and 1981. Analyses of later years (1985-90) reveal, however, that the noncompetitive bidding that may have been present in earlier years greatly diminished."

The bacterial cells are surrounded by protective extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which provide the mechanical stability for these biofilms. Little is known about the material properties of attached biofilms, making it difficult to predict how a biofilm will behave in response to an applied force. The work presented here measured the force-deflection characteristics of biofilm by two different techniques. The first method involved time lapse imaging of a biofilm grown in a capillary flow cell reactor under a constant fluid shear stress and the second method was based on micro-indentation using an atomic force microscope. For the flow cell experiments Staphylococcus epidermidis was grown in a capillary flow cell reactor. After a day of growth the biofilms received a pretreatment fluid shear while displacements were measured. The biofilms were then treated with different agents which alter the structure of the EPS matrix and thus change the mechanical properties/response of the biofilm. The four treatments examined in these experiments were FeCl 2, chlorhexidine, DispersinBÂ®, and urea. The same fluid shear was applied after the fifteen minute treatment soak and the deflections were recorded. These measurements revealed that i) biofilms behave viscoelastically ii) FeCl 2 and chlorhexidine made the biofilm stiffer while urea and DispersinBÂ® reduced the viscosity of the biofilm. For the micro-indentation experiments Staphylococcus epidermidis was grown in a drip-flow reactor. After four hours of growth the biofilms received a pretreatment indentation (5 microns depth) in which force-displacements were measured. The biofilms were then treated with FeCl 2, chlorhexidine, DispersinBÂ®, and urea. The 5 microns indentation was applied after the fifteen minute treatment soak and force displacements were again measured. The measurements revealed that again i) biofilms behave viscoelastically ii) FeCl 2 and chlorhexidine made the biofilm stiffer while urea and DispersinBÂ® reduced the viscosity of the biofilm. Quantification of biofilm material properties and demonstration that their properties can be altered by chemical or enzymatic treatments opens the door to development of new technologies for controlling detrimental biofilm based on targeting biofilm cohesion rather than killing microorganisms.

70416	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/973	The effect of a contextual approach to chemistry instruction on students' attitudes, confidence, and achievement in science	The goal of this project was to determine if students' attitudes about chemistry, confidence in chemistry, and performance in chemistry increased as a result of being taught with a contextual approach to the subject. A contextual approach to teaching means that a political, environmental, or social issue is presented to the students first and, any science content needed to better understand the issue is taught on a need-to-know basis. During this investigation, 36 students were presented with a chemistry unit taught from a contextual point of view, from which the content to understand the context was drawn. The results of this study indicated that, for the most part, student attitudes, confidence, and performance in chemistry slightly decreased, with the exception of students' attitudes about the relevancy of chemistry in their lives, which increased. Several reasons may be the cause of the decline, including not linking content activities to the context often enough, exhaustion from the unit being twice as long as other units, and overall student performance decline across subject areas during the time of the treatment period. When teaching with a contextual approach in the future, I will shorten the units and create more student-centered learning opportunities that directly link back to the context.

A comparison of fluorescence properties of Trp and 5FTrp provides a means of differentiating between relaxation and heterogeneity. Four observations concerning the fluorescence of Trp dipeptides required further explanation: decay components of approximately 20 ps, a sub 300 fs 10% loss of quantum yield, the quantum yield for Gly-Trp being significantly lower than Trp-Gly, and the fluorescence wavelength of Trp-X being 10 nm shorter than X-Trp at pH 5. With the goal of distinguishing between electron and proton transfer quenching mechanisms, the time resolved fluorescence--with time resolution of 0.5 ns--for dipeptides was measured in the X-Trp and Trp-X configurations(where X=Leu, Gly, Asp, Arg, Met), with 5FTrp substitution, at pH 5 and pH 10, and in water and D 2O solvent--resulting in 84 distinct species. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Gly-Trp and Trp-Gly dipeptides with ground and excited state charges employing multiple force fields. The methods developed by Callis and coworkers were used to calculate the instantaneous rates of electron transfer rates, quantum yield, and fluorescence wavelength. Experimentally three types of multiexponential decay were observed: quenching rate heterogeneity with no relaxation, relaxation only, and combinations thereof. The substitution of 5FTrp for Trp reduced quenching rate heterogeneity, resulting in reduction of short lifetime components, allowing for the observation of relaxation components that were most likely masked in the Trp case. Calculated electron transfer rates support lifetimes of approximately 20 ps, but not those less than 300 fs, and predict a lower quantum yield for Trp-Gly than Gly-Trp. Calculated fluorescence wavelengths reproduce the observed shorter fluorescence wavelength of Trp-X zwitterions. Failure to predict quantum yields may be caused by the inability of the molecular dynamics force fields to reproduce the conformational populations. Results support both relaxation and heterogeneity in Trp dipeptides. 5FTrp is a useful tool in distinguishing between heterogeneity and relaxation.

70419	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/977	The influence of riparian-canopy structure and coverage on the breeding distribution of the southwestern willow flycatcher	There is a long history of relating bird species diversity and distributions to heterogeneity in foliage structure as seen from within the habitat and measured from the ground up. There is also an overwhelming contribution in the literature promoting and justifying a broad-scale approach to characterizing spatial patterns, especially for the purpose of relating to, and predicting, species distributions. This study draws from the relationship between birds and habitat structure but assesses heterogeneity in structure from a broader perspective. For this analysis, I compared the spatial distribution of a breeding population of the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax extimus traillii) to the structure of a riparian zone with an emphasis on capturing patterns that are measured horizontally across the zone. Riparian zones are dynamic by nature and are structurally diverse in a natural, healthy system, and support a high density of breeding birds. The flycatcher prefers dense riparian habitat in close proximity to lentic water. The structural characteristics of the riparian zone where dense vegetation and water are present were hypothesized to be more structurally heterogeneous and to support a broader riparian zone. Riparian zone structure was mapped and stand characteristics were extracted, with the intent of relating spatial patterns in stand heterogeneity and riparian extent to the spatial distribution of the southwestern willow flycatcher. A moving window function in a GIS assessed the stand characteristics, which were imported as attributes to presence/absence data points. The extent of the analysis window was varied to determine the scale at which the habitat characteristics were most highly correlated with flycatcher presence. Correlation between the structural characteristics of the stand and the presence/absence of the flycatcher was modeled with logistic regression. Results show the flycatcher is more likely to occupy habitat that is structurally heterogeneous and has more riparian vegetation. The results also show that selection is most sensitive to habitat characteristics within a relatively close proximity.

These features consist of coronal magnetic-null points, quiescent prominences, and post flare eruption plasma sheets. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft were used to determine the fidelity of the commonly used potential field source surface (PFSS) model for predicting the location of coronal magnetic-null-points. Several properties of the null points were also investigated to ascertain if they had any effect on their observability. Next, quiescent prominence observations from the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope satellite were used to create velocity maps of the plasma found in these structures. The derived velocities provided insight into the vorticity, kinetic energy, and oscillations that reside in these prominences. Primarily, this investigation was concerned with determining the distribution of velocity and vorticity at different length scales by applying a power spectral density analysis. All of this information is intended to strengthen our understanding on how these prominences evolve and potentially become unstable. An identical analysis is then conducted on post-flare-eruption plasma sheets observed in EUV by the space based SDO and TRACE satellites. Investigating the dynamics that reside in these plasma sheets are crucial for understanding the conditions that trigger and accelerate the magnetic reconnection responsible for producing these energetic solar flares.

In contrast, some scholars suggest that North American prairie evolved under a tight linkage of fire and proximate post-fire grazing and should be well adapted to these combined disturbances. The Pautre wildfire of April 2013 provided an opportunity to test the effects of post-fire grazing in the northern mixed-grass prairie. One grazing allotment, burned in its entirety, and three burned and nonburned sites spanning a north-south gradient of the fire perimeter were selected as study locations. The effects of grazing versus rest, defoliation during the first spring, summer, or fall following the fire on burned and nonburned sites and the effects of fire on forage fiber digestibility were tested. Sites grazed during the first two growing seasons following the fire were found to recover similarly to sites rested during that same time. In addition, defoliation during any season following the fire produced no negative effects when compared to nondefoliation. Increases in forage fiber digestibility peaked shortly after fire and were short-lived, diminishing by the following year. These results lend support to the theory that fire and grazing were historically linked disturbances throughout the evolution of the North American prairies, indicating that the federal recommendation of rest is unnecessary in at least the northern mixed-grass prairie ecoregion. Historic, evolutionary patterns of disturbances, such as fire and grazing, may be useful in determining the most appropriate post-fire management regimes for specific ecoregions.

The risk of contaminated food reaching consumers can be reduced by the use of food safety training programs. As the number of vegetable consumers increases and the consumers' concern for quality food grows, there is a need to improve food handler training programs. The over-arching question guiding this research was: What enhancements can be made to the vegetable producer's food safety training program to ensure improvement in the safe practices/behaviors and increases in food safety knowledge of vegetable production employees? The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of active learning teaching strategies on the Growers Express food safety training program among vegetable packing employees using Kirkpatrick's four level model of training evaluation. A mixed-method time series design was used. Sixty-one subjects from one vegetable packaging facility participated in the evaluation. The subjects were split into two groups where they completed a food safety knowledge pre-test, participated in either an active learning or traditional training series (depending on group), and submitted a training reaction survey. The active learning training group showed significant improvement in their test scores on three of the test sections. The traditionally trained group only improved significantly on one test section and their scores decreased on one test section. All participants reacted positively to the training program, but the active learning group agreed or strongly agreed to the statements more often on the training reaction survey. Based on the results of this study, it was determined that the addition of active learning methods positively influenced the subjects' reactions to the training program, increased test scores on the food safety knowledge exam, enhanced the subjects' on job behaviors and actions, and improved the overall effectiveness of the program."

High intensity interval training (HIIT) has the ability to improve adherence as it takes less time to complete and has changes in intensity and monotony. The aim of the study was to analyze whether participants prefer HIIT in comparison to continuous aerobic exercise (CON). The hypothesis was that HIIT would be preferred and enjoyed more than CON both during and following the exercises. Participants were men and women (n=14) between the age of 30-55 years with a BMI of 25-35 kg/m2. Participants completed three exercise conditions: CON) a 45 minute walk at 60% of age predicted maximal heart rate (APMHR), HIIT60) a 20 minute HIIT exercise in which the speed and incline was changed between a high intensity of 80% APMHR and 60% APMHR every 60 seconds for a total of 10 cycles, and HIIT90) a 21 minute HIIT exercise in which the speed and incline was changed between a high intensity of 80% APMHR and 60% APMHR every 90 seconds for a total of 7 cycles. Heart rate (HR), exercise enjoyment during the exercise as measured by the exercise enjoyment scale (EES), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected at multiple time points during the exercise. Five minutes of post exercise oxygen consumption was measured immediately and 30 minutes following the exercise sessions. General feelings as measured by the feeling scale (FS) and physical activity (PA) enjoyment as measured by the physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) was measured 5 minutes and 35 minutes following the exercise sessions. HR and RPE were both higher in HIIT60 and HIIT90 compared to CON. In task exercise enjoyment was not higher between conditions. PA enjoyment was higher in both HIIT60 and HIIT90 compared to CON 5 minutes following the exercises. General feelings in HIIT60 was the only condition to increase 35 minutes compared to 5 minutes following the exercise. We conclude that HIIT is a more preferred exercise than CON as shown by higher preferences for HIIT90 and HIIT60 as well as higher ratings of post exercise PA enjoyment.

They may incorporate more than one learning style to best suit their needs, but prefer one style instead of another. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether integrating a visual-spatial teaching style would improve student test scores in the classroom and if they would retain the new content. Visual-spatial activities were incorporated into the lessons on a daily basis to support the learning of vocabulary. The research also allowed for the identification of students who preferred this learning style rather than other styles of learning. Assessments and student interviews were used to determine whether this style of learning was effective in the classroom. A comparison of the data showed an increase in test scores from the pre-test to the post-tests. Student interviews reported that they preferred learning with the visual-spatial strategies.

There were two investigations conducted, (1) a content analysis and (2) a survey. A website based content analysis was conducted. A qualitative analysis of the contents of 57 land grant institutionÎ±s college of agricultureÎ± websites identified current trends in agriculture with regard to international themes. The programs identified were: (1) study abroad; (2) faculty research and/or programs; (3) graduate research and or programs; (4) training and/or visitors; (5) international students on campus; (6) foreign agreements and/or contracts; and (7) majors, minors, certificates, curriculum, and course content. The data for the survey was conducted using a web based instrument. A census of the population of land grant institutions identified in the content analysis was conducted. All questions were based on information for the 2003-2004 academic year. Of the 57 institutions surveyed, a total of 31 surveys were submitted for a response rate of 54 percent. The results of the content analysis and the survey provided new evidence about the current state of internationalization in the colleges of agriculture in the 1862 land grant institutions.

Elementary science methods instructors recognize the challenges associated with preparing teachers for the science classroom. Two of these challenges include overcoming limited science content understanding and a low science teaching efficacy. Based upon research in science misconceptions, conceptual change theory, formative assessment, and science teaching efficacy, this design experiment explored the use of formative assessment in an authentic learning environment to address some of these challenges. As a case study, the goal was to identify two specific topics in science which the preservice teachers did not understand and to model consistent use of formative assessment to guide instruction in those science topics for six weeks. The research questions for this study sought to explore the design of the class while also exploring students' understanding of the science content and their understanding of formative assessment. One specific question was whether the formative data could differentiate between deeply held student misconceptions in science and incomplete science understanding. In addition, data was collected to measure changes in science teaching efficacy as well as preservice teachers' desire to use formative assessment in their own future classrooms. Based upon student interviews and a final content quiz, the participants in this study did show improved science content understanding in the areas of plant food/energy and plate tectonics. The course design implemented a variety of formative assessment tools including formative assessment probes, student science notebooks, student concept maps, a non-graded quiz, and more. The STEBI-B survey identified improved science teaching efficacy among the participants. Student final essays indicated improved understanding of formative assessment and students also expressed a desire to incorporate formative assessment into their future teaching. Final reflections on this case study recognize the value of formative assessment as a means for improved communication between students and teachers about student understanding in an effort to provide and model more effective science instruction.

However, too often the labs are prearranged cookbook labs where students follow detailed directions blindly without understanding lab concepts or purposes. This research was designed to increase student understanding of biological concepts through the use of frequent inquiry activities. In an effort to help students remember the importance and application of the lab, three self-reflection questions were included at the end of each activity: ""What did I do? What did I see? What did I learn?"" Pretests and post-tests were used to measure performance as well as formative assessments, surveys, and interviews. While quiz scores did not improve as a result of the treatment, student attitude towards science and labs became more positive."

Past studies conducted across the Northern Great Plains have investigated the short- and long- term effects of LGMs on water, nitrate, and carbon storage, soil parameters including potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) and enzymatic activity, and wheat yield. Less knowledge exists regarding similar short- and especially long-term effects of CCMs in the NGP. This four-year study replicated at four sites in Montana allows us to investigate how site characteristics and annual weather patterns can influence the performance of cover crop growth and the subsequent effect on soil quality. Our research approach to building cover crop mixtures using functional group composition rather than species composition aims to make the work more broadly applicable to other regions. Other regions may utilize more adapted legume or brassica species and could still use our results to estimate their effects on soil and nitrate use throughout the soil profile or their effects on soil biological parameters.

These types of films employ a variety of approaches to purport that our current system is flawed; built around industrialization and commodification of sustenance and living things. One universal method these films use to elicit audience reaction is through the use of the heroic cultural memory of farmers. I explore three very different contemporary food documentaries; Food, Inc., King Corn, and The Real Dirt on Farmer John as well as my own film Pork.0, as case studies to reveal how current social activist/issue documentaries represent the farmer by using the agrarian myth as a base, then use novel storytelling devices to show the necessity of change in the food industry. This contributes to the success of these films as effective works in the social issue/activist documentary genre.

LEDs offer numerous advantages over lamp-based technology currently used. However, these advantages have not been harnessed because of limitations in creating a solar simulator with the highest rating (AAA) for spectral match, temporal stability, and light uniformity. Oriel's VeraSol is one of the first LED, triple A solar simulators. The VeraSol-LED is compared to the equally rated Oriel Sol3A-xenon lamp solar simulator by studying the current-voltage (I-V) and spectral response of a variety of solar cells. Both simulators effectively mimic the sun; however, the results demonstrated the LED- based simulator produced a more stable, flexible, and accurate match to AM1.5G than the xenon lamp Sol3A with similar marks in the quality of PV cell response.

The Jefferson River is one of the three great headwater streams of the Missouri River and is itself comprised of the Beaverhead, Big Hole and Ruby Rivers, encompassing a substantial drainage basin of 9,532 sq. miles. The Jefferson's unique hydrological position inherently situates the basin ""at the end of the line"" of water users and flows at its confluence have plummeted to 200 cubic feet per second (cfs) during extreme drought periods, leaving little water in the river to appease appropriators along the river's remaining 80 miles. The Jefferson River (and all of its important tributaries) is highly utilized for agriculture, resulting in chronic dewatering during peak irrigation demand (typically July through mid-September). Persistent water scarcities over the last 15 years have tested the Basin's ability to sustain historic levels of agricultural production and maintain a commercial sports fishery. This thesis provides a resilience assessment of water resources in Jefferson Basin. RA's attempt to conceptualize dynamic interactions between linked social and ecological systems (SES's). Analysis of complex human use systems (SES's) is inherently interdisciplinary and necessitates a mixed methods approach. The RA completed for this thesis integrated physical analyses of the water use system (utilizing GIS, hydrology, climate and demographic data) with a qualitative survey of water stakeholders with the goal of understanding the processes that drive the Jefferson SES and identifying weaknesses that reduce resilience. Over the last 30 years the Jefferson Basin has benefited from a unique subset of water users and natural resource managers that have successfully worked to improve conditions in the face of extreme environmental challenges. This RA found that although it is highly likely that the Jefferson will be challenged by extreme conditions in the future (related to a changing climate), it is also evident that there is potential for the basin to transition into alternate and more resilient regimes."

Many modern people have been all too willing to accept that technological innovation is a good choice for the future. In this thesis, social and technological history of Medieval through post-Industrial Revolution communications are analyzed drawing in part on Theodore Kaczynski's theory on the effects of technology to our bodies, psyches, and the environment. Kaczynski's theoretical frame suggests that computing technology has changed how we write, what our response times and the tone of our writing is, and what words look like in the last quarter century. The spoken word promoted with the advent of moveable type helped promote literacy among the masses. Computer technology then again changed printing and expectations around writing. Humans have gone from verbal, to printed words, to using images to communicate. As the look of words migrated to the symbolic, the ease of message delivery and the introspection of composing thought is shortened, words are written that often would not be spoken to the reader, and people no matter their age are touched by this technology. This thesis uses Ted Kaczynski's, (also known as the Unabomber) ideas to challenge the core of our views of these modern devices and the choices we make to adopt or reject them. Whether the choices we make are an expression of freedom or of necessity we must become more aware of how technology changes the way we live, work, and respond to these instruments as models of choice. Historical perspective helps us to analyze whether we are chewing up time or getting beyond unabashed acceptance of technology in the twentieth century.

This disparity does not evade those who work in hospitals or health professions, as the nursing profession is routinely statistically ranked in the top ten most obese occupations in the United States. Obesity, and its co-morbidities, such as depression, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, and chronic joint pain, are associated with higher rates of injury, absenteeism, and poor job performance. The purpose of this project was to analyze the current overall health status of the employees at a community hospital in Western Montana and to use this statistical information to develop a health and wellness program tailored to the identified deficiencies and problem areas. A total of 403 employees, 32% of the total population, participated in voluntary free health screenings. Results of the screenings indicated that 32.3% (n=130) of staff were overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and 25.6% (n=103) were obese (BMI >30). Additionally, 77.4% (n=312) of the screened population reported exercising less than five days per week, while 13.4% (n=54) reported not exercising at all. In regards to daily caloric intake, 63.3% (n=255) of employees are at increased risk for health issues related to poor food choices, while 28% (n=113) are at very high risk. Furthermore, when analyzing mental health, 31.3% (n=126) of employees indicated high levels of stress at work, 20.1% (n=81) indicated they are experiencing two or more major life events that were causing stress, and 16.4% (n=66) reported having a depressed mood, or feeling down, unhappy, and hopeless. These findings demonstrated that this setting is in need of overall health improvement. Through this project, a multifaceted health and wellness program was established to target the identified risk areas, as well as promote overall wellbeing at no cost to the employee. The conclusion of this project is that through the identification of problem areas and creation of the associated interventions, a health conscious work environment that promotes average BMI, healthy eating, balanced mental health, and physical activity provides multiple incentives and benefits to both the individual and the employer (CDC, 2014).

70434	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9843	Institutional portfolio management : a model of integrated planning	The pilot study and manuscripts presented in this dissertation introduce institutional portfolio management as a model of integrated planning to address institutional performance improvement. Higher education is under pressure to demonstrate and improve institutional performance in terms of access, cost, and throughput. Few models exist to guide leaders in implementing transformative change that will address the problem. Program prioritization is a means to do so yet it is usually implemented as a one-time solution and not without controversy. A parallel model of portfolio management is used in private industry as an ongoing and rational practice of organizational strategy. The parallels of the two disciplines have not previously been noted in extant literature. Through my collected body of doctoral work, I provide empirical data on the processes and outcomes of program prioritization. I establish structural contingency theory as a central paradigm explaining the cycle of mission fragmentation and program prioritization in higher education. I evaluate the practices of program prioritization and illustrate the parallel with its industry cousin portfolio management. I introduce institutional portfolio management as a model of integrated planning based on the best practices of both disciplines. A pilot study published as a conference proceeding finds common themes from interviews of institutional leaders who have undertaken program prioritization. The themes revealed a relationship between strategic approach and successful outcomes. They also provided support for the practice of inclusivity and transparency in the process as important keys to successful outcomes. The first article searches for correlation between institutional characteristics and the tendency toward program prioritization. The study finds that large doctoral and land-grant institutions are more inclined toward program prioritization than those with more focused missions, such as private liberal arts institutions. The second article establishes structural contingency theory as a central paradigm that explains the cycle of mission fragmentation and program prioritization, inductively reasoned from the history of higher education. It also explains why the needed transformational change is hindered by administrative success and how a model of integrated planning can overcome that impediment. The third article elaborates the practical elements of the framework so that practitioners can deploy it.

Frequently, this same screening tool is facilitated by principals and implemented by teachers one time per month to monitor students' progress. With the increased attention on testing, educators report that they are fearful they are not using all of the data wisely that they are collecting (Peverini, 2009). Furthermore, it is not enough to know whether students are performing proficiently or below grade level standard; it is important to diagnose the type of learning difficulty that is standing in the way of mastery so that teachers can appropriately plan ongoing instruction (Chappuis, 2014). The motivation for this study is the notion that principals who lead in transformational and collaborative ways that focus on high-impact instructional methods experience grade level proficiency that is three to four times greater than when limiting instructional leadership to that of promoting only a focus on the implementation of the school's mission and vision (Buffum et al., 2012; Robinson, Lloyd, & Rowe, 2008). The purpose of this quantitative and qualitative multimethods study was to identify administrators' and teachers' perceptions of the overall formative assessment process in reading and to determine their perceptions of effective formative assessment practices commonly used to indicate students' level of proficiency with reading standards and to plan ongoing instruction. Overall, teachers and administrators shared similar perceptions of the formative assessment process and its use. Teachers and administrators agreed that classwork and observations are essential for identifying a student's zone of proximal development, essential for planning ongoing instruction, and effective evidence of student progress toward standard mastery. Moreover, during reading instruction, teachers and administrators indicated that encouraging and corrective feedback should be provided for students against clear learning goals. To lead the formative assessment process in reading effectively, it is critical for administrators to be high-impact transformational and instructional leaders.

Introducing nanoparticles with cladding metals produces metal matrix nanocomposites which in turn improves the material characteristics of the clad layer. The strength of the laser cladded reinforced metal matrix composite are dependent on the location and concentration of the nanoparticles infused in metals. Hence, investigating the nanoparticle diffusion characteristics during solidification of laser cladding process is of prime interest. The governing equations that controls the fluid flow are standard incompressible Navier-Stokes and heat diffusion equation whereas the Euler-Lagrange approach has been considered for particle tracking. The mathematical formulation for solidification is adopted based on enthalpy porosity method. During the solidification process of liquid titanium, particle flow and distribution has been observed until the entire geometry solidified. A two dimensional numerical analysis has been performed to identify and track the silicon carbide nanoparticle diffusion in titanium. A numerical model implemented in a commercial software based on control volume method has been developed that allows to simulate the fluid flow during solidification as well as tracking nanoparticles during this process. The influence of the free surface of the melt pool has a high importance on the fluid flow as well as the influence of pure natural convection. Thus both buoyancy and Marangoni convection have been considered in terms of fluid flow in the molten region. A detailed parametric study has been conducted by changing the Marangoni number, convection heat transfer coefficient, different initial distribution of particles, and thermal boundary condition of bottom wall to analyze the behavior of the nanoparticle movement. Variation in particle's initial distribution along with different Marangoni number and solidification time results in a high concentration of nanoparticles in some portion of the geometry and lack of particles in rest of the geometry. High concentration of nanoparticles decrease with a decrease in Marangoni number. Furthermore, an increase in the rate of solidification time limits the nanoparticle movement from its original position which results in different distribution patterns with respect to the solidification time.

Of particular interest is the left ventricle of the heart, which pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs out through the aorta. One method for imaging blood flow is injecting FDA-approved micro-bubbles into the left ventricle, and then, using the motion of the microbubbles and the frame rate of the ultrasound scan, the blood velocity can be calculated. In addition to blood velocity, echocardiologists are also interested in calculating pressure gradients and other flow properties, but this is not currently possible because the velocity data obtained is two-dimensional and contains noise. In order to realize the full potential of microbubbles as a tool for determining the pumping efficiency and health of the LV, three-dimensional velocity data is required. Our goal is to assimilate two-dimensional velocity data from ultrasound experiments into a three-dimensional computer model. In order to achieve this objective, a numerical method is needed that can approximate the solution of a system of differential equations and assimilate an arbitrary number of noisy experimental values at arbitrary points within the domain of interests to provide a ""most probable"" approximate solution that is accordingly influenced by the experimental data. In this thesis we present two different approaches for data assimilation, the first approach is more computationally expensive, but requires only a single step. The second approach uses a two stage data assimilation technique but is computationally less expensive. The motivation for using the least-squares finite element method approach is that it provides many advantages such as the ability to match the numerical solution more closely to more accurate data and less closely to the less accurate data."

A quantitative analysis design using secondary survey data from the National Survey of Student Engagement was employed to answer the research questions in the investigation. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to model the relationship of the dependent variable(s) (student outcomes) on a collection of independent variables (diversity experiences, student demographics). Accordingly, OLS provided estimates of the association between student experiences with diversity and self-reported student outcomes. Findings revealed that each diversity experience (coursework, interactional and climate for diversity) had a positive influence on the student outcomes of educational gains, personal and social gains, institutional satisfaction and supportive campus environment. The diversity experience by gender or by race and ethnicity interactions were not consistent across student outcomes. Importantly, findings also revealed that coursework diversity may not be as influential predictor of student outcomes when other forms of diversity experiences are available to students. This study offers additional support that indeed diversity experiences are important to the educational mission in higher education.	['persons', 'students', 'college students']

Human activities on the periphery of protected areas can limit carnivore populations, but measurements of the strength of such effects are limited. Both African lion (Panthera leo) and leopard (Panthera pardus) are declining throughout their ranges, and thus accurate monitoring of key populations is critical. Both of these species face pressure from encroaching human populations, particularly from trophy hunting, illegal bushmeat harvest, and human-carnivore conflict. In Zambia, South Luangwa National Park and its buffer areas are thought to contain the country's largest lion and leopard populations. However, this protection gradient is experiencing rapid human population growth and activities that are known to threaten large carnivore populations elsewhere. Here we examined the status and major anthropogenic drivers of the South Luangwa lion and leopard populations. First, we estimated population size, trends, survival rates and demography for the South Luangwa lion population from 2008 to 2012. These data indicated that trophy hunting was impacting the South Luangwa lion population, and potential management actions exist and should be implemented to mitigate impacts from trophy hunting. Second, we measured how the density and survival rates of South Luangwa's leopard population varied across this gradient of protection using remote camera trap surveys from 2012-2014 during a ban on trophy hunting. We estimated that leopard density was higher inside South Luangwa National Park as compared to an adjacent buffer area with lower levels of protection, but could not detect differences in leopard survival across these two areas. This difference in density was most likely driven by prey depletion in the buffer areas, and this limitation is likely an issue for other sympatric large carnivore species. Finally, we developed a rapid survey method based on pedigree reconstruction to estimate population size, with validation based on a simulated population. This method shows promise for surveying unstudied large carnivore populations. Overall, large carnivore populations face growing anthropogenic pressures worldwide, and management action to mitigate population declines must be informed by intensive monitoring of key large carnivore populations to identify the drivers and dynamics of such declines.

70442	http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9853	Derailed : factors influencing college and career decisions of High school students. in a deindustrialized rural community	"High schools in the United States are charged with preparing students for citizenship and the knowledge, skills and experiences for success in postsecondary education and work. This study examines the problem of how to prepare students for college and work in a rural deindustrialized working-class community where jobs and careers that allow for upward economic mobility are scarce. This ethnographic case study sought to understand the influences and interplay of school-based and non-school-based factors that influenced students' decisions as they graduated and made the transition to college and work. Participants were two generational groups of alumni from working class families in the same high school. The first group was comprised of those who graduated in the decade that followed the closure of the railroad in Livingston, Montana in 1985. The second group was comprised of those who graduated a generation later, 20-30 years after deindustrialization. The study found that the economic restructuring that occurred a generation after the deindustrialization altered the factors that affected the transition from high school to college and work for children in working class families. Financial stress and financial instability weighed more heavily on the present generation. College was seen as an investment in the 1985-1995 generational group, whereas college is a gamble for the 2005-2015 group. The 2005-2015 working class group saw themselves as ""too rich"" for grants, but ""too poor"" to afford college. While parent expectations for educational attainment remain the same for all participants, the latter group has fewer community ties and a greater reliance on educators in the high school. The study concludes with recommendations that include interventions in the areas of college and career counseling, an examination of rural college and career readiness, critical pedagogical and collective impact approaches. The study calls upon school leadership to articulate competing discourses that shape educational practice and policy, and to be informed by the awareness that students' subjective experiences of their lives are embedded within economic, political and social structures, as they attempt to intervene in the lives of young adults who will enter a precarious labor market."

Although literary criticism has recently expressed an interest in the history of channeled writing, especially in its Victorian and early modernist iterations, the field has rarely considered the fascinating channeled texts of the New Age movement. Therefore, I hope to show that New Age channeled texts are comparable to the channeled texts of earlier periods, particularly in the ways these works challenge our conventional understandings of authorship. Writing from the 1960s through the early 1980s, Jane Roberts claimed to channel the teachings of a discarnate energy personality named Seth. My purpose in this project will be to show that the Seth material, even as a product of the New Age movement, can be read according to the same principles that scholars have developed for approaching the channeled texts of previous eras. Because the Seth material comprises dozens of works over thousands of pages, I have focused my investigation on a single text: The God of Jane: A Psychic Manifesto. Written by Roberts, the book is a memoir which describes her experiences as a medium. Through various close readings of the manifesto, and by situating the work in a historical and cultural context, I demonstrate that The God of Jane functions as an interpretive guide for reading New Age channeled texts. In addition, I find that Roberts is not only a literary medium, she is also a literary theorist, who translates the tradition of mediumship into the latter half of the twentieth century.

The methodology of this research was the consensus building process known as the Delphi survey. Survey participants (n=33) were chosen based on their expertise as educators, resource managers and scientists living and practicing in the Flathead Watershed in northwestern Montana, USA. Participants' responses were gathered through the three-round survey by the Montana State University (MSU) research team using MSU's online software program Desire 2 Learn (D2L), an anonymous, asynchronous platform with distance accessibility. Round One responses were gathered through the D2L discussion function so that participants could read each other's responses and reply if desired, allowing an exchange and development of ideas. Round One discussion responses were formatted into statements, which were then made available to the participants to rate through two successive rounds using 1-5 Likert scales. Of the initial 142 statements, 91 statements were retained in the final round. The 91 final statements were matched to Flathead Watershed Sourcebook contents to identify the learning objectives for the Flathead Watershed Educators Guide. The final statements listed the knowledge, skills, and dispositions survey participants felt were most important for students in the Flathead Watershed to learn. Statements showed concern for conservation and protection of the natural environment through place-based watershed education.	['persons', 'middle school students', 'students']

For example, summary measures contain measurement error, as the true value of the variable is estimated from observed data that contain sampling variability. Measurement errors should be accounted for when they are present, as the impacts of ignoring measurement errors include bias in parameter estimates and a loss of power to detect effects. Measurement error models are used to account for measurement errors and correct parameter estimates for the bias induced from variables measured with error. To account for measurement errors when present, most correction methods require that the measurement error variance be known (or estimated). Common correction methods include the method of moments correction, the SIMEX correction, and Bayesian correction methods. The area under the curve (AUC) summary measure is commonly used in pharmaceutical studies to estimate the total concentration of a substance present in the blood over a given time interval. Other areas, such as Ecology, use the AUC to estimate the total count of a species present over a specified time interval. In situations where the AUC is estimated, a measure of the uncertainty associated with it is often desired. Due to the longitudinal nature of AUC data, the estimation of its variance is often not straightforward. In this research we develop a Bayesian method to estimate the variance of the AUC, where our focus is on accounting for the possible correlation structure between repeated observations on the same subject. This estimate can then be used in measurement error models to account for the measurement error induced from estimating the AUC. We study the performance of three measurement error correction methods in the simple linear regression setting, where measurement errors are present in the explanatory variable, the response variable, or both. We extend the Bayesian correction methods to account for uncorrelated and correlated measurement errors between variables. The methods were validated using both simulated and real data collected from an equine study of blood glucose measurements.

In order to achieve truly high-throughput analysis of biological assays, a multiple-input approach must be taken. This thesis is focused on developing and validating a drop-based microfluidic method that is capable of encapsulating, in parallel, 96 assay samples in drops and optically tracking them in a barcoded drop library. The advantage of the method presented here is its ability to be integrated with current biological assays performed on a 384-well plate. The first step was to fabricate a three-dimensional microfluidic device capable of accepting 96 sample inputs. Second, formation of drops within the device was characterized by creating a state diagram using Capillary and Weber numbers of the two phase flow. Finally, the use of fluorescent microbeads was investigated for the purpose of optically barcoding drops. A barcoding scheme was developed to allow for fluorescent and spatial labeling of 96 wells of a 384-well plate. The three-dimensional microfluidic device was successfully used to encapsulate 50 microns diameter drops from 24 wells barcoded with fluorescent microbeads at a drop formation rate of 3 kHz per well. Fluorescent detection of the barcoded drop mixture was performed at a rate of 200 Hz and density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN was used to identify barcoded drop clusters from the fluorescent signal data. Validation of this method was achieved by adding known concentrations of fluorescent blue microbeads to barcoded wells and detecting for their presence in barcoded drop clusters. The barcoding method can be expanded to fully incorporate the 96 inputs of the microfluidic device by adding a spatial barcoding component to each quadrant of 24 optically barcoded wells. The results presented here show the microfluidic platform has the potential to be a useful tool in biological assays involved with tracking a large number of samples in a well plate format.

It explores the various avenues women have undertaken to confront the impacts of male dominance and whether they have advanced in their endeavors to alleviate the struggles and demands of their own lives, the lives of their children and families, as well as their tribal nations. Additionally, the question of whether the feminist movement is relevant to Indigenous women is explored. This research involves a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on Indigenous methodologies, the determinants of which are covered in the text. Oral interviews have also been incorporated as supporting material, thanks to women participants from the reservations of South Dakota. This exploration of avenues Indigenous women have taken in challenging male dominance illustrates that they are utilizing various approaches to advance healing and growth. Despite such challenges as single parenthood, they are making strides to become educated in order to better address obstacles to healthy communities. Additionally, women are developing organizing strategies in order to confront violence, substance abuse, poverty and lack of education. Likewise, through spirituality, activism and the arts, they are finding a voice of resistance. Through this research study, it has been determined that women are also confronting male dominance that has not only been imposed on their communities from without, but has also pervaded their lives through lateral oppression. Their particular methods of confrontation act as foundational steps toward the creation of healthier lives for themselves, their children and families, their communities and their tribal nations, not only in contemporary times, but for the coming generations. This study is based on the image of the star quilt, an art form common among Indigenous women during the last century. Each point of the star illustrates the path that Indigenous women have taken in their quest to confront male dominance and promote healing for present communities and the generations to come.

Further, studies have revealed the critical role positive mood and emotional states play in heightening perceptions of meaning. Building from this work, my thesis explored whether emotional experiences of awe uniquely impact meaning in life. Though recent investigations involving awe offer theoretical reasons why awe might affect meaning, no published research has specifically tested this relationship. I hypothesized that an awe-eliciting nature video, relative to a neutral video, would enhance meaning both directly and indirectly via increased perceptions of social connectedness and spiritual-transcendence. Further, since research has demonstrated a connection between positive affect and my dependent measures, I hypothesized that these awe effects would arise when controlling for positive affect (e.g., happiness). I tested my hypotheses through an online study using previously validated methods. Though the manipulation elicited differences in self-reported awe, it did not significantly alter my dependent variables. However, when I statistically controlled for self-reported happiness, the awe manipulation decreased ratings of meaning in life directly and indirectly via decreased social connectedness. As such, I discuss how complexities in the experience of awe and specific dispositional traits may account for these findings, and outline possible future directions.

The current policy debate focuses on whether to leave the mandate for corn and sugarcane based ethanol at 15 billion gallons per year or to lower it. This study assesses the effects of proposed ethanol legislation by evaluating both the historical effects of U.S. ethanol policy and approximating the outcomes of currently proposed legislation. Historical effects are assessed following Luchansky and Monks (2009) and lengthening the monthly data series to 1994 to 2009, further controlling for autocorrelation and adding explanatory variables to control for the ethanol blender's credit and environmental policies encouraging ethanol use. The study finds there was a structural break in the U.S. ethanol industry in 2002 and that the interaction of environmental policies and a 186 percent increase in the retail gasoline price from 2002 to 2008 drove the rapid expansion in the U.S. ethanol industry starting in 2002 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2011f). The effects of proposed legislation are assessed using an Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM). The classic EDM is expanded to determine whether or not policy outcomes diverge when using a linear versus a non-linear approximation procedure. Results suggest outcomes of current policy proposals for U.S. ethanol producers and corn farmers are determined by the ethanol mandate. In contrast, policy prescription outcomes for ethanol consumers and foreign ethanol producers are jointly determined by the mandate, subsidy and tariff. However, no economically significant differences resulted from using the linear versus the non-linear approximation procedure. This study finds that the future of the U.S. ethanol industry will be jointly determined by the level of the U.S. ethanol mandate and long-run retail gasoline prices.

An important design challenge hindering the performance of fuel cells is controlling water removal to maintain a hydrated membrane while avoiding excess water that may lead to channel blockage. Fuel cell water management requires a detailed knowledge of multiphase flow dynamics within microchannels. Direct observation of these gas-liquid flows is difficult due to the small scale and viewing obstructions of the channels within the fuel cell. Instead, this work uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to compute the dynamics and formation of droplets in fuel cell channels by imposing contact angles and computing the curvature at the interface along the wall boundary. This thesis focuses on developing and implementing two methods to assist in computing the dynamical behavior of droplets in PEM fuel cells. The contact angle method leverages a conservative volume-of-fluid (VOF) formulation coupled with novel methodologies to impose and track dynamic contact angles. In particular, it is shown that variation of the contact hysteresis angle influences the wetting properties of the droplet and significantly impacts water transport throughout a fuel cell channel. The proposed curvature scheme employs the method of least squares to fit an implicit polynomial function to a cloud of points created at the interface. The points are constructed from the volume of fluid (VOF) representation of the phase interface and the curvature is computed explicitly from this best fit polynomial function. It is shown that the new curvature method is second-order accurate and can be used to compute the curvature of a droplet along a boundary with prescribed contact angles. This thesis presents details of the numerical approaches used to implement contact angles and to compute the curvature based on novel methods. The developed numerical methods are then used to simulate a droplet contained in a channel with an incoming gas flow and discuss the results relevant to water management in PEM fuel cells.

Once limited by field-based forage assessments, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) have gained considerable attention as proxies for landscape-scale forage biomass and quality at fine temporal scales. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), these indices have become especially important for understanding how potential advances in the timing of spring green-up due to climate change and human land use may be influencing the forage patterns available to migratory elk (Cervus elaphus). Given this concern, more information is needed on how the forage biomass and quality available to elk varies across elevation-related phenology and land use gradients and on the reliability of using NDVI and EVI to map forage patterns across the GYE. Using 250m2 MODIS NDVI and EVI and field estimates of grassland biomass and quality, we examined how the rate and magnitude of seasonal variation in forage biomass and quality differed across elevation-related phenology and land use gradients, assessed how the accuracy of NDVI and EVI as proxies for forage biomass and quality differed across the landscape, and then mapped spatiotemporal variation in the abundance of high quality forage for elk across the Upper Yellowstone River Basin (UYRB). We found that: (1) Grasslands with late onset of growth and irrigated agriculture had a faster rate of growth and a greater seasonal magnitude of biomass and quality for elk than all other grasslands; (2) 250m2 NDVI and EVI explained minimal variation in grassland biomass and quality across the UYRB; and (3) the accuracy of NDVI and EVI differed across elevation-related phenology and land use gradients in the UYRB. These results provide novel information on the rate and magnitude of seasonal variation in forage biomass and quality and on the reliability of using NDVI and EVI to map the forage patterns available to migratory elk.

Montana state agencies have expressed the need to mitigate drought and damage from extreme flood events by identifying new locations for more efficient water storage. In the 2015 Montana State Water Plan, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) identifies natural storage infrastructures (floodplains, wetlands, riparian areas) as valuable tools to increase drought resiliency and mitigate water shortage. Quantifying how much water can be stored through natural storage has been a key question for Montana water planners. This study addresses western state management needs for a cost- and time-effective method of estimating floodplain water storage potential and provides a GIS-based model that identifies potential natural storage sites using open-source data. The result is a range of storage capacities for a study site near Melstone, Montana, under eight natural water storage conditions. Storage potentials ranged from 934 m 3 for small flood extents to 321,252 m 3 for large floods. This model can be refined using additional hydraulic inputs, and re-scaled to address more complex questions probing the efficacy of natural infrastructure-based water storage in the western United States.

The literature is inconsistent on what individual characteristics are critical to being a good liar. Zukerman, DePaulo, and Rosenthal (1981) suggested that lying is cognitively demanding. Therefore, WMC might provide an advantage for some when telling a convincing lie, such that higher WMC individuals can handle the high cognitive load associated with lying. I examined this across two experiments. I predicted that individuals with higher WMC would be able to better tell more convincing lies, because such individuals are better at suppressing prepotent, but goal irrelevant information, such as the truth. Additionally, higher WMC individuals are better equipped to focus and tune out distraction that accompanies a high cognitive load. I also predicted that younger individuals will have an easier time telling convincing lies than older adults. As we age, cognitive functioning, like WMC, declines, and with this decline, so does our ability to deceive others. In Experiment 1, young adult dyads took turns telling truths and lies, under high and low cognitive load. The detector tried to determine whether their partner was truthful or deceitful. In Experiment 2, younger and older adults told truths and lies into a camera and two young adult detectors tried to detect the truths and lies, at a later time. I found a positive relationship between WMC and telling lies such that higher WMC individuals had fewer of their lies detected when under high load. I also found that a higher WMC improved the ability to comply when asked to tell a truth or lie. I also found that when responding to questions, participants found it easier to comply when asked to lie or when under high cognitive load. In regard to age differences, older adults found it more difficult to tell lies than truths. Issues within deception could involve specific memory processes and require more research to understand what aspects of memory are involved in telling a convincing lie.

Higher education institutions should be interested in understanding these collaborative relationship as a way to support and encourage them and to understand the culture and behavior of faculty. This study seeks to understand those collaborations by looking at the collaborative dyad of two faculty members as the unit of analysis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between research productivity and the demographic characteristics of faculty collaborative dyads. Using a survey methodology, data was gathered from tenured and tenure-track faculty at two research institutions about their primary research collaboration and the resultant productivity of this collaboration as measured by three outcome variables: (1) Intellectual Contributions - Published, (2) Presentations, and (3) Grants Awarded. The relationship between the demographic characteristics of gender, rank and discipline on the productivity of the dyad were studied with data gathered through an electronic survey to faculty at two institutions. A 34-item survey was distributed to 830 faculty and 207 usable surveys were received. Descriptive statistics and negative binomial regression were used to analyze the data. The results of negative binomial regression analysis of the data indicate that disciplinary homophily is significantly related to all measures of productivity while rank homophily is significantly related to Intellectual Contributions - Published and gender homophily is significantly related to Presentations. Overall, though the research supports the Similarity Attraction Paradigm theory in that homophilous dyads tend to be more productive than their heterophilous counterparts. This study adds to the growing body of knowledge about interdisciplinary collaboration, and specifically the micro-level characteristics of what productive collaborations look like. Recommendations for promoting such collaborations include mentoring of different ranks, and facilitating collaborations across disciplines that are more different from each other than would typically be found in a research collaboration.

Increasingly states are awarding waivers allowing schools and districts to move away from the traditional Carnegie time-based approach to teaching and learning (Worthen and Pace, 2014). One innovative effort toward school reform that has shown demonstrable increases in student success is competency-based education (Haystead, 2010). This education model offers self-paced, standards-based curriculum that requires students to demonstrate proficiency in content before advancing (Borre, 2012; Worthen and Pace, 2014). Extant school reform literature focuses primarily on adult perspectives; however, in order for lasting school reform efforts to succeed, the inclusion of student perspectives is critical (Silva, White, and Toch, 2015). This intrinsic case study was conducted at a public competency-based high school to investigate youth perspectives of components that contribute to student success and to identify components that could be improved to support student success. Youth participants in this study consist of students enrolled in a high school that was included in a whole-district adoption of competency-based education, reaching full implementation in 2012 (Sommers, 2015). The study asked students, from their perspectives, to identify: 1) which components of competency-based education support student success, 2) how those identified components support student success, 3) which element of competency-based education could be improved in order to increase student success, and 4) how improving those components would contribute to an increase in student success. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with ten youth, and two administrators. Additional data was collected through researcher-generated field notes and relevant artifacts. Results indicate two distinct categories contributing to student success: 1) School-Level and 2) Student-Level. Results indicate three categories youth participants identified as needing improvement to support student success: 1) Increased Learning Facilitator access, 2) Technology, and 3) Advisory Period. Multiple components are discussed for each category. Suggestions for further research are included.

In addition to the typical stressors of an average college student, such as homesickness, finances, academics, and social relationships, student-athletes must also cope with lack of free time, pressure to perform, relationships with coaches and teammates, and physiological stress due to training and competing. Student-athletes with unmanaged chronic stress are more likely to experience a plethora of negative health outcomes, effecting performance in the classroom, on the field, and in life. Currently, survey instruments exist to predict cognitive and physiological sources of stress in isolation, but no existing instrument integrates both cognitive and physiological stressors into a single measure of chronic stress. The current cross-sectional study compared magnitude and sources of stress, psychological and physiological, experienced by Montana State University student-athletes (n=30) and their non-athlete counterparts (n=22). In addition, associations between chronic stress (as indicated by hair cortisol concentration, or HCC) and subjective measures of psychological stress, physiological stress and sleep quality were assessed in a subgroup of participants (n=12 student-athletes; n=9 non-athletes). Student-athletes had significantly greater average weekly training load than the non-athlete students (P < 0.001), but all other indicators of psychological stress and sleep quality were not significantly different between the two groups. Of those participants who provided a hair sample, the student-athletes had greater average HCC (P = 0.027). Although no associations were observed between HCC and measures of psychophysiological stress or sleep quality, a significant correlation was observed between HCC and body fat percentage (r = -0.59, P < 0.045). Additional research is necessary to elucidate the role of body composition, as well as other factors, on chronic stress development in college student-athletes.

Yet the National Writing Project's professional development model has established a long-term record of measurable impact on student writing improvement and profound influence on its participants' ways of thinking and living their teaching and writing lives. For many, the experience is transformative. This dissertation investigated two questions: First, what are the features of a professional development model that facilitate transformation learning over time? Second, how do participants view the way these features of a transformative professional development model inform their classroom instruction? This narrative inquiry is informed by the theoretical lens of adult transformational learning and investigated two practicing writing teachers who participated in the National Writing Project Summer Institute at least three years ago. The study found four resonant narrative threads: structure, risk, audience, and agency. Participants deeply restructured their classroom writing instruction over time in a way that shared agency with student writers and that posed risk to instructors and students. This occurred frequently through shifting writing audience away from teachers and providing greater authorial voice to student writers, which are practices both participants experienced in a National Writing Project local site.

In trying to understand a spatially determined ethos, this thesis studies the construction and reproduction of The Sheridan's Daybreak(s) series from Sheridan County, Montana. Produced throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, these local histories lend themselves to a study of the characteristic qualities of place negotiated by the presence of matter together in space. The study of the Daybreak(s) reveals an anthropocentric presentation of ethos in the 'pioneer' figure that inevitably understands itself in relation to the context of 'nature' which it shares the spaces of Sheridan County with. It also reveals a nostalgic and romanticized type of memory in regards to both spaces and the past families of this place that does not critically engage with the events of those families lives. And it reveals the persistent presence of the global within the local spaces of its inhabitants through presentations of the Rural Idyll and modern day, mechanized agricultural production. Each of these, in part, make up the ethos of the spaces of Sheridan County represented in the Daybreak(s). In interpreting the representations of space and place, this thesis argues for continually ongoing re-readings of our local histories in order to better understand the ethos of the past that contributes to the socially and materially constructed present. In doing so, scholars can give more attention to issues of rurality and local history while giving credit to the material contexts from which these local histories arise.	['history']

The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the EMG/Torque relationship of vastus lateralis changes as a result of fatigue. The second purpose of this study was to determine if tests of functional ability are affected by fatigue. Twenty-two subjects (13 males and 9 females) were sampled from two populations with different types of training (strength versus endurance) experience. The procedures included a five-minute self-selected warmup on a cycle ergometer, pre-fatigue functional ability tests, fatigue protocol and postfatigue functional ability tests. The functional ability test protocol included four singleleg hopping drills to assess the functional performance of the knee joint. Torque was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60 degrees per second through a functional range of motion until acute fatigue was reached during the fatigue protocol. Surface EMG electrodes were placed over the vastus lateralis to develop an EMG/Torque ratio during the dynamic contractions. The results indicate training type did not significantly affect torque production (p = 0.373) or the EMG/Torque ratio (p = 0.744) during isokinetic knee extensions in response to acute muscular fatigue. The strength-trained sample tended to have a greater increase of the EMG/Torque ratio during the fatigue protocol. The results did indicate that there were two significantly different types of response to acute muscular fatigue (p < 0.001). There were significant differences between the preand post-fatigue functional ability tests for the M/L (p < 0.001) and Up/Down (p = 0.011) but not for 3-Forward (p = 0.408) or Figure-8 (p = 0.286). One group doubled their activation magnitude during the fatigue protocol, while another group did not increase their activation magnitude during the fatigue protocol. It is possible that the increase of activation magnitude seen during the fatigue protocol is a result of transition of fiber type utilization. Further study is needed to determine what is the primary cause of the muscleÎ±s response to acute muscular fatigue.

The unnamed alpine glacier at the headwaters of the Wheaton River, Yukon, Canada, provides an ideal setting to compare deglaciation processes that result in three different proglacial environments. The glacier has evolved from occupying one large catchment (~4 kmÂ²) to two smaller catchments (each ~2 kmÂ²) via glacier thinning and net mass loss, forming two lobes separated by a medial moraine. Field observations revealed neither crevasses nor evidence of subglacial drainage outlets and suggested this glacier had a non-temperate thermal regime with meltwater predominantly flowing from supraglacial and ice marginal sources. Climate and bedrock geology were similar for the subcatchments, providing a natural laboratory to compare deglaciation processes. This study compared the hydrology and biogeochemistry of three outlet streams from this glacier: one stream drained a proglacial lake which is fed by meltwater from the lower west lobe, a second stream drained the upper west lobe, and a third stream was the major drainage outlet for the east lobe. Hydrologic monitoring over the 2006 melt season (June-August) and analyses of water samples for dissolved ion content and carbon indicated that the meltwaters are dominated by CaÂ²+ and HCO 3-, which are derived from biogeochemical weathering of crustal materials. The study demonstrated that the presence of the proglacial lake, which acted as a meltwater reservoir, measurably modified meltwater residence time, water temperature, water chemistry, and bacterial biomass relative to the proglacial streams. Rock:water interaction between meltwater and medial morainal sediment and fine-grained, reactive glacial flour suspended in the streams and the lake water column also enhanced biogeochemical weathering within the catchment. Thus, this study provided a small-scale example for how differences in proglacial environments and water flow paths affect headwater hydrology and biogeochemistry. This study was the first of its kind in the Coast Mountains, Yukon, Canada, and results presented here aid in the understanding of how proglacial environments created by climate-induced glacier retreat affect hydrochemistry, hydrology, and carbon dynamics in remote high elevation environments.

The streams that border the property, Bozeman Creek and the East Gallatin River, exceed the Montana Department of Environmental Quality's (MTDEQ) water quality standards for nitrogen (0.27 mg/L) and phosphorus (0.08 mg/L). Wetlands in the landscape have become more intriguing in the advent of MTDEQs adoption of Circular DEQ-13, a legal framework for nutrient trading to achieve improved watershed water quality. Earth-work took place in Summer/Fall 2014, including excavating 5,800 m 2 of disconnected floodplain, and filling a surface drain. The research objectives were to quantify the impacts of the restoration so as to make inferences about the short-term changes in groundwater/surface water interaction, wetland volume and area, and the wetland's impact on the water quality in the bordering streams. Measurements of groundwater levels and surface water flow rates, and water chemistry analyses for both water sources, were recorded weekly from 30 shallow wells and 5 stream gauging stations from August 2014 through September 2015. Groundwater velocity and hydraulic residence time were estimated by performing slug tests in several groundwater wells. Spatially normalized wetland area and volume were calculated based on interpolated groundwater surfaces. Throughout the monitoring period, in all surface and groundwater samples, total nitrogen never exceeded 3 mg/L, averaged 0.76 mg/L, and almost always exceeded the target standard for the East Gallatin River. Total phosphorus was below the detection limit in 97% of all samples and never exceeded 0.22 mg/L. Neither average nutrient concentrations nor pH showed significant general temporal trends, while dissolved oxygen decreased over time. Changes in hydrology were generally localized near earth moving activity. Overall, wetland volume decreased slightly and wetland area increased slightly. Hydraulic gradients showed the primary flow of groundwater to be out of the wetland, with an average soil water velocity of 0.11 m/day. The slow moving groundwater in the wetland system appears to limit the extent of groundwater/surface water interaction, and hinders the role of the wetland in enhancing the water quality in the receiving creeks.

In order to determine the net benefit (cost) to society of agricultural chemicals, the social costs and benefits must be quantified and valued. One potential social cost of agricultural chemical use is the human health effects of chemically-contaminated groundwater. In this thesis a multidisciplinary framework, incorporating physical models and economic production models, is developed to value the health risks of polluted groundwater. This framework can also be used to determine the impacts of agricultural policy on groundwater quality. In the economic model, farmers jointly make input use, management and land use decisions. Land use decisions determine the environmental characteristics of the land in production. The farmer's economic production model is linked with an environmental damage model (such as a chemical fate and transport model) to determine the amount of groundwater pollution resulting from the use of agricultural chemicals on land with particular environmental characteristics. Toxicology and epidemiology studies are used to estimate the human health risks presented by groundwater contamination, and a contingent valuation method is used to place a value on those risks. The contingent valuation method uses survey techniques to elicit individuals' willingness to pay for a change in the level of groundwater contamination and the accompanying change in health risks. A case study is presented in order to evaluate the feasibility of linking the chemical fate and transport, economic, and human health models. Although the general physical models needed for this framework are currently available, most of these models are designed to be used by researchers within the respective discipline. Consequently, there are some important gaps in methods and data, including: (1) chemical fate and transport models that do not simulate chemical movement down to the groundwater zone, (2) lack of chemical-specific toxicity and epidemiologic data, and (3) lack of location-specific environmental data. This study illustrates the need for researchers to be aware of the implications and potential applications of their research, both within and outside their fields.

Running couples a natural cinematic impulse because, like cinema, it is a temporal and spatial experience. However, what truly makes running a profound cinematic subject is its expressive and perceptive nature. That is, when we are running we are not only engaged physically, but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Running forces us to go beyond our physical ourselves, to reach an enlightened state, which is in many ways similar to the embodied experience of watching a film. Cinema is widely viewed as a transformative medium that gives life to the invisible, subjective world of imagination, thoughts, and ideas. Running and cinema are ultimately visceral experiences with the power to reorient our subjectivity and thus transform our perceptions of the world and ourselves. In sum, the spatial, temporal, and reflexive similarities between running and cinema make the two a seamless pair. In order to argue running's inherent cinematic impulse and demonstrate these parallels between running and cinema this paper analyzes three running films: 'The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner' (1962), 'Spirit of the Marathon' (2007), and 'Finding Traction' (2014). It also looks at my film, 'There's a Light Beyond These Woods' (2016), and the stylistic and technical choices I made in order to capture an authentic running experience. In a world where increasingly more emphasis is being placed on personal narratives and self-reflexivity, perhaps running films are the ideal representation of how cinematic storytelling can inspire self-reflexivity and alter our embodied consciousness.
